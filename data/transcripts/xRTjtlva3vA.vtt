but we do have ability first it's
 
00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.270 align:start position:0%
but we do have ability first it's
actually

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
six bills and i was hoping uh to take
 
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
them up one at a time and try to keep
 
00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
some kind of order
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
as opposed to you know pulling out
 
00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
calling on people and going from one
 
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
section of the bill
 
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
to the other so i guess my question is
 
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.110 align:start position:0%
to the other so i guess my question is
for

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
brad at this point if would it work if i
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
ask people that are
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
um remote to not put their hands up
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
until we get to that section
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
is there resentment can you repeat that
 
00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
question yeah is that is it a doable
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
thing for me to
 
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
ask people who want to speak or have
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
signed up
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
do not raise their hand until we get to
 
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.790 align:start position:0%
do not raise their hand until we get to
that

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
that section of bill i mean um i believe
 
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.830 align:start position:0%
that section of bill i mean um i believe
you

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
certainly can i believe that would be up
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%

electric vehicle
 
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh and the bill arises
 
00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:58.949 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh and the bill arises
from

00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh the commission on electric vehicle
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
we established three years ago your

report which i believe has been
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
sent to committee members and so this
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.150 align:start position:0%
bill represents a few small items from
that

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
report to help us be ready for um
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
this this business and uh tourism and uh
 
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.110 align:start position:0%
this this business and uh tourism and uh

uh you know effects of the arrival of
 
00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:30.870 align:start position:0%
uh you know effects of the arrival of
electric

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
electric
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
um electric vehicles um becky oller who
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
has been spearheading electric vehicle
 
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.990 align:start position:0%
has been spearheading electric vehicle
infrastructure

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
issues in the department of
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
environmental services is i believe
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
available to you this morning if you
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
have some more questions about
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
the background here i want to start
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
first by
 
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
noting governor sununu's leadership
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
on this issue when we received the
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
vw settlement funds there was a maximum
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
amount that could be designated to
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle infrastructure and
 
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
governor sununu
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
decided to put that maximum amount about
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
5.6 million dollars
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
to this so that and really in three
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
buckets he said
 
00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
some should go to the department of
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
transportation other
 
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
state agencies if they need the
 
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.870 align:start position:0%
state agencies if they need the
infrastructure

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
some might go to electric school buses
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
and then the largest part would go to
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
help building out
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle charging infrastructure
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
on our main
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
transportation corridors with fast
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
charge stations and then to look at
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
some level 2 chargers on secondary roads
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire at businesses and other
 
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
places uh
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
convenient to to travelers uh so
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
um osi and des have worked on requests
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
for proposals to get that
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
um that vw money um
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh spent um the bill um
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
outlines uh some of the findings from
 
00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:02.310 align:start position:0%
outlines uh some of the findings from
the

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%

some of the context as well is that some
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
of the states around us are selling high
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
numbers of electric vehicles not so many
 
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire yet
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
um quebec their new vehicle sales about

electric and um you know we're seeing
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
the industry move this direction
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
um i saw yesterday notice the f-150 the
 
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.310 align:start position:0%
um i saw yesterday notice the f-150 the
best-selling

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
best-selling
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle united states is going to be
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
manufactured in electric vehicles
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
starting this
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
spring and gm has committed to electric
 
00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.629 align:start position:0%
spring and gm has committed to electric
vehicles

00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
by 2025 and some other auto companies by
 
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.710 align:start position:0%
by 2025 and some other auto companies by
2030

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
2030
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
2035 as well so the auto industry
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh is wants to be sure that um the state
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
is ready
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
on our transportation corridors as as
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
as well um and uh i also would just like
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
to mention with a little new hampshire
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
angle on it i'm sure a lot of you know
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
merchants fleet
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
and it's one of the largest fleet
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
operators in the in the nation and um
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
business new hampshire their uh ceo had
 
00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:21.190 align:start position:0%
business new hampshire their uh ceo had
an

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
article about how you know technological
 
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
innovation this is the next big thing
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
for fleet management because of the
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
amount of money they can save
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh on these these vehicles so that's
 
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
just a
 
00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
way of saying that the this bill is
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
meant to do some some small changes
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
that'll get us on the
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
path to having this infrastructure ready
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
and i'll turn to the bill and um you'll
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
see the first part
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
are some findings which um lay out the
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
some of the rationales from the
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
commission report
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
about promoting tourism generating jobs
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
support consumers

00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
by having this infrastructure available
 
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
in the state it also mentions the work
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
that the commission
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
did with the utilities who are very
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
much interested in helping build out
 
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.870 align:start position:0%
much interested in helping build out
this

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we had a lot of
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
participation from unitil eversource
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire electric co-op which
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
is very aggressive in its programs about
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh charging infrastructure for
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
um its its customers um the heart of the
 
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:27.750 align:start position:0%
um its its customers um the heart of the
bill

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
really is in sections two and uh three
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
um section two kind of
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
reiterates what we did in um senate bill
 
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.110 align:start position:0%
reiterates what we did in um senate bill
575

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
575
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
three years ago um that was a bill that
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
set out some basic you know requirements
 
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:45.829 align:start position:0%
set out some basic you know requirements
about

00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
signage about parking about public
 
00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:50.870 align:start position:0%
signage about parking about public
availability

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
availability
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
of charging stations and what we wanted
 
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
is that the money that the state is
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
putting out from the vw
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
settlement or potentially from other
 
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.470 align:start position:0%
settlement or potentially from other
federal

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
um uh awarded funds
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
that these ought to be available to
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
everybody there shouldn't be any
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
proprietary technology
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
you'll see now if you go to our rest
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
areas uh in
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
on 93 um the charging stations there are
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
tesla charging stations and we wanted to
 
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
um anybody who had any kind of vehicle
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
would be able to pull up
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
and uh use the facility if it's being
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
funded by the vw
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
settlement funds uh section three
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
responds to something that we heard a
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
lot from businesses
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
and from municipalities um they are very
 
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.670 align:start position:0%
and from municipalities um they are very
eager

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
eager
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh to start building out their in
 
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.350 align:start position:0%
uh to start building out their in
infrastructure

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
and so this section uh enables
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities under 79e as they do for
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
other things
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
to provide an abatement for the added
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
value to assessed property um
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
for electric uh vehicles um
 
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:01.990 align:start position:0%
for electric uh vehicles um
infrastructure

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
and um this is something that you know
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
businesses uh said
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
you know and and uh potentially people
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
who want to put the infrastructure in
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
department complexes
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh and elsewhere um that this would
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
enable municipalities as a lot of them
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
are doing for
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
for solar and for other kinds of
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects uh
 
00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:22.959 align:start position:0%
that they could have a a a an abatement
 
00:15:22.959 --> 00:15:23.590 align:start position:0%
that they could have a a a an abatement
of

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
increased value assessed value of
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
property for a limited period
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
of time if they chose to do that
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
um section 4 takes some of the language
 
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.470 align:start position:0%
um section 4 takes some of the language
that

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
is before the public utilities
 
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.749 align:start position:0%
is before the public utilities
commission

00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:39.759 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
senate bill 575 three years ago
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
required the poc to open a docket on the
 
00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.150 align:start position:0%
required the poc to open a docket on the
charging

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
charging
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
structure and the rate structure how are
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
they going to handle
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle infrastructure and uh
 
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
there was a draft report from staff
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
that laid out some principles and that's
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
what we put
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
in here um believing that really you
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
know it's the legislature that makes
 
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.430 align:start position:0%
know it's the legislature that makes
policy

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
um not the agencies and that if these
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
seemed like
 
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
common sense ways that this is kind of
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
what other states are doing and what the
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
staff at the puc
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
thought was the way to go that we ought
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
to have it in statutory
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
um language um that said you know the
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
puc is going to do its work
 
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
and uh you know with the new department
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
of energy whatever entity they call it
 
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.110 align:start position:0%
of energy whatever entity they call it
uh

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
the dockets will continue and so on and
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
um so if the members of the committee
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
feel it's premature to do this um
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
i know that there you know madeleine
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
leno will be before you thinking there's
 
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:40.710 align:start position:0%
leno will be before you thinking there's
one

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
piece of this that maybe ought to be
 
00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:43.990 align:start position:0%
piece of this that maybe ought to be
changed

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
but if the committee thinks that this is
 
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
premature or
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
you know not ready to want to put this
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
in statute i
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure section four at this time
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
is absolutely necessary so really the
 
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.710 align:start position:0%
is absolutely necessary so really the
bill

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
becomes section two in section three of
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
part one um let me just
 
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
mention as a last uh moment too is that
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
there is a remnant
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
um physical note to 131
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh originally this section of the bill
 
00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:14.789 align:start position:0%
uh originally this section of the bill
proposed

00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
as we had passed a couple years ago to
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
move towards electrifying the state
 
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.630 align:start position:0%
move towards electrifying the state
fleet

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
fleet
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
we decided in the senate to take that
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
out and the physical node has not caught
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
up with it so for this section of the
 
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
bill there is no physical impact for the
 
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.510 align:start position:0%
bill there is no physical impact for the
state

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
at all so i just wanted to
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
mention that because i i know how
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
physical notes uh sometimes remain with
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
bills and uh get a little
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
out of date and um wanted to clear that
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
up as
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
as well so mr chairman i i know becky
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
oller and some others are
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
here from the charging industry and
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
elsewhere who might be available but i'd
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
any questions that uh anyone might have
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
thank you senator any questions from the
 
00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:03.510 align:start position:0%
thank you senator any questions from the
committee

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
i'll let you off the hook that easy i
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
see chairman
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned yesterday is it possible
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
for me to um
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
briefly say a couple words about uh part
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
four that's fine do you know if there's
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
gonna be anybody else
 
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh testifying to the bill when we get to
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
i'm you will have safety here okay well
 
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:24.549 align:start position:0%
i'm you will have safety here okay well
then

00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
fair enough then sure yeah so i'll just
 
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
say very um
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you so much mr chairman i know
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
how hard it is for you to deal with
 
00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.029 align:start position:0%
how hard it is for you to deal with
these

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
omni offals that the senate sends over
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
anyways you know i i feel a little bit
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
sheepishly it seemed like a good idea
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
back in november but here we are right
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
um so um part four is essentially
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
housekeeping uh at the request of uh
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
um safety um we had a
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh card a golden granite state card
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago that allowed
 
00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:03.830 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago that allowed
people

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
um to uh get discounts if they had one
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
of these cards if you were
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
a senior citizen and um that program
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
ended about a decade ago and uh no
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
longer is this
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
so this this removes that language from
 
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.230 align:start position:0%
so this this removes that language from
statute

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
i will say uh having turned 70 fairly
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
recently i never got to use this card
 
00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:28.630 align:start position:0%
recently i never got to use this card
but

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
there it is and then um essentially what
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
it establishes is that
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
um you have one form of picture id that
 
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:36.549 align:start position:0%
um you have one form of picture id that
you

00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
you you would have one form of uh of
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
picture id
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
um and not two uh if you
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
required one from the if you wanted one
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
from the department of safety
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
so um you'll i believe um say you know
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
safety is here
 
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
um it's it is housekeeping but that's
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's the gist of that part of it mr
 
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.150 align:start position:0%
that's the gist of that part of it mr
chairman

00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh i see one
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you senator
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
waters for taking my question
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
um when i was reviewing this section one
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
little piece jumped out at me um and i
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
hope i would love to get your take on it
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
um on the very first part where it
 
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.110 align:start position:0%
um on the very first part where it
clarifies

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
clarifies
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
who is eligible for a non-driver picture
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
id card
 
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
you have a anyone 12 years of age or
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
older who does not possess a driver's
 
00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:29.909 align:start position:0%
older who does not possess a driver's
license

00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
b is disabled and does not possess a
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
or c which is being struck out is 65
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
years of age or older
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
and has could have a driver's license i
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
understand you're taking out that
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
part c when i read it line b
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
concerned me because i believe anyone
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
who's disabled
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
falls under line a um our granite
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
staters who are of the disability
 
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.230 align:start position:0%
staters who are of the disability
community

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
are also 12 years of age or older
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
and i think that this line b might be
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
left over from times when they were
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
the disabled community was called out
 
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.310 align:start position:0%
the disabled community was called out
unnecessarily

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
and i did reach out to director bolecki
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
and i have drafted an amendment which
 
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.110 align:start position:0%
and i have drafted an amendment which
would

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
take out line b i just wanted to run
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
that by you
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
to see if that would be something you
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
would be agreeable to
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
well certainly and thank you um
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative for the question
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
and for catching that because um i had
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
not really thought about it and i think
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
clearly it is a remnant it seems to me
 
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.029 align:start position:0%
clearly it is a remnant it seems to me
of

00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
an earlier way of dealing with ids and
 
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.149 align:start position:0%
an earlier way of dealing with ids and
uh

00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
really wouldn't be appropriate for the
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
reasons that you you suggest so thank
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%

uh remarks or comments about the other
sections

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
sections
 
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill i'm only going to make
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
comments about
 
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
section one my concern with section one
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
is primarily sections three and sections
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
four the
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh prime sponsor senator waters
 
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:51.909 align:start position:0%
uh prime sponsor senator waters
mentioned

00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
in his testimony that section four may
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
be premature and i would concur with
 
00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.190 align:start position:0%
be premature and i would concur with
that

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
judgment i think um adding section four
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
to the st
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
to statute at this point is is premature
 
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.310 align:start position:0%
to statute at this point is is premature
because

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
the principles outlined in that
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
statutory language
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
would then require the public utilities
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
commission to
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
bake into electricity rates the costs
 
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
of some infrastructure
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle recharging
 
00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
infrastructure going forward
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
and the intent of the bill originally
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
was to
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
use the 4.6 million dollars allocated
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
from the volkswagen
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement to build that
 
00:24:39.919 --> 00:24:40.870 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement to build that
infrastructure

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
and so while that seems appropriate it
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
does not seem to me
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
to be appropriate at this time anyway to
 
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.029 align:start position:0%
to be appropriate at this time anyway to
build

00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
that into electricity rates for the
 
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
future so i would
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
recommend eliminating
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
section four if you decided to go
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
forward with this bill
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
but another problem with the bill is
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
section three and that's the tax relief
 
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill i realize that it's
 
00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
optional for cities or towns to
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
provide that tax relief should they
 
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
decide to do so
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
presumably by a majority vote of their
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
governing body
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
but nevertheless i would remind members
 
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:24.630 align:start position:0%
but nevertheless i would remind members
that

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
any time you provide property tax relief
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
for one segment
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
of the population you're increasing the
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
property tax burden
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
on the other segment of property
 
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.470 align:start position:0%
on the other segment of property
taxpayers

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
so be careful when you
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
implement this kind of policy it
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be necessary for this
 
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.190 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be necessary for this
particular

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
infrastructure if it's going to be
 
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
funded by
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
settlement money from the volkswagen
 
00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.590 align:start position:0%
settlement money from the volkswagen
settlement

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
so i would encourage you to remove
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
section 3 from the bill as well
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
if you decide to go forward with it
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
those two sections i see as
 
00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.590 align:start position:0%
those two sections i see as
problematical

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
problematical
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
it could be that and i will admit i
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
haven't read the report
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
from the the committee that senator
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
waters referred to earlier
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
but i have looked at the documents that
 
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.630 align:start position:0%
but i have looked at the documents that
osi

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
osi
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
and des generated about the
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
volkswagen settlement mitigation effort
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
and i've looked at the documents about
 
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.510 align:start position:0%
and i've looked at the documents about
uh

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
recent rfps that have been issued and
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
received no response
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
to indicate that there's no dramatic
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
need for this infrastructure at this
 
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.190 align:start position:0%
need for this infrastructure at this
time

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
so i would i would argue that
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
it may be prudent to consider
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
postponing this infrastructure bill
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
until a later date so that it can be
 
00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:58.310 align:start position:0%
until a later date so that it can be
made

00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
more practical
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
and satisfy the requirements of
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
the mitigation effort that osi and des
 
00:27:09.039 --> 00:27:09.510 align:start position:0%
the mitigation effort that osi and des
have

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
laid out there doesn't seem to be any
 
00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.510 align:start position:0%
laid out there doesn't seem to be any
great

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
human cry for this infrastructure at the
 
00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:16.710 align:start position:0%
human cry for this infrastructure at the
moment

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
so you might want to consider
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
eliminating this
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
this section of the bill entirely um
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
but if you do retain parts of the bill i
 
00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:27.269 align:start position:0%
but if you do retain parts of the bill i
would

00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
recommend eliminating sections three in
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
sections four
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll answer any questions
 
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
if i can
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
um i do see
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative gagne thank you mr
 
00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.230 align:start position:0%
representative gagne thank you mr

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
can you hear me uh repton balls
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
yes i can larry thank you thank you i'm
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
using my
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
your opposition to parts of this bill
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
of this section i see two
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
section threes are you talking about
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
line eight
 
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
on page two or line
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
well i'm looking at the version of the
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
bill that i
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
i got off of the general court website
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
and doesn't have line numbers
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
um okay i'm looking at the
 
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
section three called community
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative votes um
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
if for taking my question um
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
would i it was a two-part question if
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
you bear with me
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
would you recognize representative votes
 
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.190 align:start position:0%
would you recognize representative votes
that

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
tourism is an important part of the new
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for that question i
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
certainly recognize that tourism
 
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:15.400 align:start position:0%
is important to our economy
 
00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:21.350 align:start position:0%
is important to our economy

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
but i forgot that i normally i shut it
 
00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.510 align:start position:0%
but i forgot that i normally i shut it
off

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
off
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
when i'm at the state house but anyways
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
i i sent it to voicemail
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead i apologize
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
no problem go ahead okay so
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
with that in mind um while they're
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
the adoption of electric vehicles in new
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire has been
 
00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:46.110 align:start position:0%
slower than other states there's um
 
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:47.590 align:start position:0%
slower than other states there's um

[Music]
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
i suspect that the numbers
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
of tourists who would be coming to the
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
state and who will need this
 
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is rising dramatically in
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
the next
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
few years and i i wondered how you felt
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
i don't doubt that there will be um
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
an increase in tourists driving electric
 
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles in the future
 
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
and i think we can provide for them but
 
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think this particular bill
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
is the best way to build that charging
 
00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.590 align:start position:0%
is the best way to build that charging
infrastructure

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my questions
 
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.909 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my questions
representative

00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:27.919 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative erin thank you
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
mr chairman good morning everyone and
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
good morning representative vos
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
can you hear me as uh well
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
yes i can hear you fine okay thank you
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
um so my question is regarding

the volkswagen settlement money do you
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
know if there is any kind of time limit
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
i thank you for that question
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
representative i'm not aware of any time
 
00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.230 align:start position:0%
representative i'm not aware of any time
limit

00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
you can view the documents on the osi
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
website for all the details
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
i don't have it open in front of me i
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
read it several hours ago so i
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
i can't comment specifically on that but
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
i don't believe there is a time limit
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much you're welcome
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
good morning can you hear me we can
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
good morning great thank you uh and my
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
name is rebecca ohler i'm with the
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services and
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
be able to respond to a couple of the
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
questions that just came up
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
um i'll take the second one first which
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
time limit for the volkswagen funding
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
um there is in fact a time limit for
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
spending down the funds
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
we need to have the funds uh i believe
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's 80
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
expended within seven or eight years
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
um and if we if we don't if if we're not
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
at least
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
um at that level then we will not
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
qualify for any bonus funding
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh and we have to have the funds uh
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
fully expended
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
at ten years and if the if we do not
 
00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
have it fully expended at 10 years any
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
remaining funds
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
are are removed from the new hampshire
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
beneficiary trust
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
so that if anybody has what's any
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up on that i'd be happy to
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
try to answer more on that yep uh thank
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
you very much uh i didn't have one
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
when was the settlement what was the
 
00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.630 align:start position:0%
when was the settlement what was the
date

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
how many years has it been now it's uh
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
we are entering year three
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
of the settlement yes thank yes
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
so that the state got a total of about
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
ballpark 32
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
31 32 million dollars 15
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
of that can be spent on electric vehicle
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
charging infrastructure the remainder
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
is to be spent replacing diesel
 
00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:24.149 align:start position:0%
is to be spent replacing diesel
equipment

00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
the volkswagen violations were related
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
to their
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
their subterfuge of their of their
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
diesel emission systems
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
um and uh the
 
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
state has spent probably about six
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars so far replacing diesel
 
00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.990 align:start position:0%
million dollars so far replacing diesel
equipment

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
um so that gets me to the second uh part
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
of it which
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
was that there was not a big demand for
 
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
the uh vw funding for electric vehicle
 
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
charging infrastructure
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
and we did put out a solicitation for
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
what's called fast chargers which is the
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
sort of the highway charging where you
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
can get
 
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
a full charge in in 20 to 40 minutes
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
and we got uh
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
we did not get any qualifying responses
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
but that was not from lack of interest
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
it was a failure on our part to put
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
together a good solicitation
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
this was the first time we had done that
 
00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:21.190 align:start position:0%
this was the first time we had done that
we

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
we just sort of missed a lot of the the
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
key points that we needed to uh to have
 
00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.310 align:start position:0%
key points that we needed to uh to have
included

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
we have been working diligently to
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
revise that solicitation
 
00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
uh we hope to get that out soon des is
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
working with the office of strategic
 
00:34:36.399 --> 00:34:37.510 align:start position:0%
working with the office of strategic
initiatives

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
initiatives
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
but we are getting i get a call probably
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
at least
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
once every couple of weeks from somebody
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
asking me
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
when are we going to get the
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
solicitation out because people are
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
waiting for it
 
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to clarify that we we
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
went out we did not get any
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
qualifying responses but it was our
 
00:34:55.839 --> 00:34:59.109 align:start position:0%
qualifying responses but it was our
fault

00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:02.390 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative aaron yes thank you very
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
much uh mr chairman
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
um ms oller i'm interested to know
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
if if there's uh any kind of
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
documented plan by des
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
to you know in terms of dates
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of placement
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
where any of the charging stations may
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
be placed with money
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um first to
 
00:35:37.839 --> 00:35:39.190 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um first to
clarify

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
the entity that sort of controls the vw
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
fund right now is the office of
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives and des
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
works under an agreement with them
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
because they don't have
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
a big staff so we and and also because
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
des has more
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh experience in the realm of
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
transportation sector
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
so the there are no specific dates
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
on getting any particular infrastructure
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
out there is
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
one one unit that is being i hope
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
under construction right now at the
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
green street lot right around the corner
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
from the state house
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
and that will provide level two charging
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
there which is the sort of lower
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
you'd spend a couple of hours on a
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
but there is no specific timeline on
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
getting the funding out
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
other other than meeting that having the
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
funds spent
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
the appropriate amount within seven or
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
any further quote representative
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh thank you
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
miss ohler for taking my
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
question um can you explain how these
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
charging stations work in other words if
 
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
i have an electric
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
vehicle and i approach this
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
um well if i plug in my car do i have to
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
like put in a credit card and stuff
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
how does this whole how does it all work
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um typically
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh yes it it would be just like
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
filling up with gas and that you would
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
you would put your credit card in and
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
and you would get your allotment of fuel
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
back out in
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
for whatever the agreed upon price is uh
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
the way that
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
that we are setting things up any of the
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
any unit built using state dollars which
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
would include the vw
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
funds would have to clearly specify what
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
the price is that you're going to pay
 
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
just like a gas pump it has to say the
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
amount per gallon on it
 
00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh and um
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
i would it would be as seamless as that
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
um i mean i don't know if you've ever
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
drive on 93 but there are tesla chargers
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
fast chargers at the
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
welcome centers on either side of 93 in
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
hooksett right now
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
and yeah they're just i mean on those
 
00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:58.310 align:start position:0%
and yeah they're just i mean on those
it's

00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
the tesla is sort of a different
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
scenario and that they have their own
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
charging system
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately no other vehicle can
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
use a tesla charging system
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
um but uh yeah it would
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
most of them probably would not have a
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
swipe credit card it would either have a
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
tap system
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
and that's just because of security
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
they're not you can put a
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
charging station pretty much anywhere
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's not like a gas pump that has to
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
have a fire suppression system and
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
generally needs a tendon an attendant
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
there to make sure that there's not a
 
00:38:29.599 --> 00:38:31.030 align:start position:0%
there to make sure that there's not a
spill

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
spill
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
and so one of the concerns with the
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
charging infrastructure is
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
safety in terms of somebody trying to um
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh put a card reader you know one of
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
those things that can grab your
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
card number so so wouldn't be using a
 
00:38:45.599 --> 00:38:46.069 align:start position:0%
card number so so wouldn't be using a
swipe

00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
swipe
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
card but probably a tap card or um we'll
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
always have the option for
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
calling an 800 number and initiating a
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
charge over the phone
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.310 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
tillerson

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
tillerson
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you mazzola
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question just to better
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
understand how these
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
funds um can be used are they exclusive
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
just the state for building
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure or is there any avenue
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
for municipalities to access some of
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
these funds to expand
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
charging stations locally yes thank you
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
for your question
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
um the intent is it's not so
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
i guess let me back up the state is not
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
the one that is intending to build the
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
the charging infrastructure um i
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
i suppose theoretically some of it could
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
be used for
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
putting infrastructure on state-owned
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
property and and therefore the state
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
making some investment but the bulk of
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
this is intended to be
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
public charging infrastructure um
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
we've as as sort of directed by the ev
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
charging commission
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
the initial priority is trying to get
 
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:53.670 align:start position:0%
the initial priority is trying to get
the

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
charging infrastructure along the uh
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
major cars so i-93 95
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
89 and then some of the
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
some of the state routes you know 101 16
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
some of the some of the higher traffic
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
volume areas
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
and for those we would be uh soliciting
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
proposals from the private sector to say
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
tell us where you want to put it put it
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
tell us where
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know what type of equipment
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
you're going to put in what are your
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
hours of operation what's you know what
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
are what are all the details of how
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
you're going to operate this
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
and then we will be evaluating the
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
proposals that come in
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
and selecting the ones that meet based
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
on our evaluation the needs of the state
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
i just have a couple just for my own
 
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.990 align:start position:0%
i just have a couple just for my own
notes

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
notes
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
i said it was 15 of the volkswagen
 
00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.470 align:start position:0%
i said it was 15 of the volkswagen
settlement

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes so approximately 4.6 million okay
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh we follow the follow-up to that we've
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
heard about
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
tesla's charging stations currently on
 
00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.710 align:start position:0%
tesla's charging stations currently on
93

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
93
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
a few times now who paid to put those
 
00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.829 align:start position:0%
a few times now who paid to put those
stations

00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
stations
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
tesla paid tesla paid to put those in
 
00:41:14.319 --> 00:41:15.190 align:start position:0%
tesla paid tesla paid to put those in
that's

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
it was part of their marketing strategy
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
and i must say it's worked pretty well
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
is that they they have built out their
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
own charging infrastructure across the
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
entire country
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
so if you own a tesla you can drive from
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
here to the west coast and know that
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to be able to
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
pick up a charge at you know
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
every everywhere you need it along the
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
way final follow-up for me
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
um do you know if uh ford gm
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
toyota or any of the other manufacturers
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
have that same goal
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
no the other manufacturers are not uh
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
pursuing a node their propriet their own
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
proprietary charging infrastructure
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
they are all using the the
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
um the charging mechanism
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
that would be found in a public charger
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
so there's
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's we're still sort of in the years of
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
you know the betamax versus sony
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
era where there's there's not yet full
 
00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.030 align:start position:0%
era where there's there's not yet full
agreement

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
among all of the world's manufacturers
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
as to what charging system is the best
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
so there are in addition to the tesla
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
charging uh
 
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
mechanism there are two others one is
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
primarily used by european and
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
and u.s manufacturers the other was just
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
primarily used
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
by japanese and korean manufacturers
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
um so on most well if
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
any charters that are built using the
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
volkswagen dollars the fast chargers
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
would would be required to be equipped
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
with both of the
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
sort of the american and the european or
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
american and asian
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
um charging nozzles so that it could be
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
used for any
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
vehicles and then the tesla
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
owners can also buy their own adapter
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
that would allow them to
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
to connect to that station as well so
 
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
basically it would be a universal
 
00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.309 align:start position:0%
basically it would be a universal
charging

00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
charging
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
and that's the the goal of the use of
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
the vw money is
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
is universal charging stations that's
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
the only thing it'll be spent on
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative sykes did
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
you put your hand down
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
i did so i wanted just to make the point
 
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
that uh miss
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
ohler just made which is that the any vw
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
money being used would be for universal
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
charging systems so that it's
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
broadly available to the motoring public
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
i see one more question representative
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
o'hara thank you
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and just um your last
 
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
question made me think of
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
a question is this going to turn into
 
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
anything like our phones with chargers
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
like our manufacturers are going to
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
change the way they charge
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
and then now all of our equipment is
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i just went through that myself
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
with a new phone um
 
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
and i you know i obviously can't for
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
tell the future for what uh auto
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are gonna
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
do but i do not think so um this is
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
very well established uh you know
 
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
the most of the states around new
 
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:13.190 align:start position:0%
the most of the states around new
hampshire

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
and and as it was also pointed at quebec
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
are very well along in terms of
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
establishing charging infrastructure and
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
and have just thousands and thousands of
 
00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:26.470 align:start position:0%
and have just thousands and thousands of
vehicles

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we do have about we're
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
approaching 6 000
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
evs that are uh registered right now
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
and that's up from only about four
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
thousand last year and about two
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
thousand the year before that so we are
 
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:40.390 align:start position:0%
thousand the year before that so we are
seeing

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
really significant increases year over
 
00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.589 align:start position:0%
really significant increases year over
year

00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
with electric vehicle adoption in new
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire and
 
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
availability of charging more broadly
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
across the street
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
a state will not only help new hampshire
 
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
residents adopt and operate these
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
vehicles but it will also
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh help support the tourists from all of
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
these states around us that have
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
you know in the tens of thousands of
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
registered and they will then be able to
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
come to new hampshire
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
on vacation and know that they can they
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
can uh
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
top up their cars when they need to
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:16.839 --> 00:45:22.230 align:start position:0%
thank you
it's

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just a quick
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
question you um
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh the universal chargers
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
would uh be able to adapt to be able to
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
buy an adapter if you had a tesla
 
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to use those in conjunction
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
does tesla have any type of adapter that
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
people can use so they can use
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
their chargers good question and no
 
00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:50.630 align:start position:0%
their chargers good question and no
no

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
i see no further question
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative thank you
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you miss over
 
00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
one question if you choose to answer
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
this question in your opinion
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
do you feel why we perhaps
 
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
throughout the country except for tesla
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
you the other uh
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
car companies are not
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
putting in their own chargers is it
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
because perhaps they are waiting for the
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
public funds
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
to fund these charges so they won't have
 
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.870 align:start position:0%
to fund these charges so they won't have
to

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
i have no basis to have an opinion on
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
that i don't know why they're not
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much fine i see
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
no other questions i'm not going to ask
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
again i'll get you up there
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you thank you
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
for having me
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
um she recognizes
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
nino and i believe she
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
clean energy new hampshire with a
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
just promoted her she should be
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me yes good morning
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you uh hopefully this this lasts
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
because i've been having
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
some internet hiccups this morning but
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully you'll be able to hear me
 
00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.710 align:start position:0%
hopefully you'll be able to hear me
throughout

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
throughout
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
um yes i do represent clean energy new
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire we're a non-profit that works
 
00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:26.549 align:start position:0%
hampshire we're a non-profit that works
on

00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
clean energy energy efficiency and all
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
things clean tech we also coordinate
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
drive electric new hampshire so we do
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of work on
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles and charging
 
00:47:35.839 --> 00:47:37.270 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles and charging
infrastructure

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
i registered as neutral on the bill
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
because we
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
support most of it the first three
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
sections however we do have concerns
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
about section four regarding the rate
 
00:47:48.319 --> 00:47:48.870 align:start position:0%
about section four regarding the rate
design

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
design
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
standards for electric vehicle charging
 
00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:51.990 align:start position:0%
standards for electric vehicle charging
as

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
senator waters explained very well these
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations were taken
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
from a docket at the public utilities
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
commission and this was the poc staff's
 
00:48:01.599 --> 00:48:03.109 align:start position:0%
commission and this was the poc staff's
recommendation

00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
however i do have concerns that putting
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
them into statute would be
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
overly prescriptive and not allow
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
flexibility for the utilities
 
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
to design rates that work for each of
 
00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.990 align:start position:0%
to design rates that work for each of
them

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
specifically we're also opposed to item
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
six regarding the appropriateness of
 
00:48:22.079 --> 00:48:22.630 align:start position:0%
six regarding the appropriateness of
demand

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
demand
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
charges on public charging demand
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
charges are actually really problematic
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
when they're applied to public charging
 
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.750 align:start position:0%
when they're applied to public charging
especially

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
especially
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
high draw fast charging stations they
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
make the cost
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
extremely high especially early on when
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
you might have low utilization
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
so if the station is used once a month
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to get
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
a very high demand charge and that will
 
00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.030 align:start position:0%
a very high demand charge and that will
make

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
that one charge incredibly expensive
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
so we're actually work there's a lot of
 
00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:56.079 align:start position:0%
work going on at the public utilities
 
00:48:56.079 --> 00:48:56.950 align:start position:0%
work going on at the public utilities
commission

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
on electric vehicle charging rates
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
and so i would like to be able to
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
continue to work at the commission with
 
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
the utilities
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
on those rate designs there and
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
these are being used as sort of as i
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
said as guiding principles but i don't
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
i would not want to see them in statute
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
and saying that the utilities
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
shall comply with these exact
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
rate standards because i do think that
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions thank
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
you any questions from the committee
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
i hope i'm not ignoring anybody i just
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
see a couple of senators
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
on the list but no hands-free so i'm
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
assuming they're at this point
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
waiting to speak to a different part
 
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.950 align:start position:0%
waiting to speak to a different part

bill
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
the last hand i do see is uh mr kevin
 
00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:54.470 align:start position:0%
the last hand i do see is uh mr kevin
miller

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
a member of the public actually
 
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
represents chargepoint
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chairman walsh and
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
through you to the members
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is kevin miller
 
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:10.470 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is kevin miller
i

00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
represent a company called a chargepoint
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
we are supportive of sections one two
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
and three of the bill but
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
took a neutral position due to some
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
lingering concerns around uh
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
section four of the bill we would be
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
able to be supportive of the bill
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
if there were either changes to strike
 
00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:30.150 align:start position:0%
if there were either changes to strike
that

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
section or to put in targeted changes to
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
to more effectively reach some of the
 
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
nuanced positions that were
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
previously described so really briefly
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
i'll give some background on chargepoint
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
since 2007 our company has been creating
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
the new fueling network to move all
 
00:50:46.319 --> 00:50:46.710 align:start position:0%
the new fueling network to move all
people

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
on electric uh charges our business
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
model consists of selling
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
smart charging solutions directly to
 
00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
businesses governments organizations
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
while offering them the tools to get the
 
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
most value out of providing ev charging
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
as an amenity
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
as a reason to attract new visitors or
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
new customers
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
or new tenants to locations
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
so you charge your car where you park
 
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
your car so it's not just a pit stop
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
experience along a highway it's also
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
when you get to home and work
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
and it can serve as a really valuable
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
grid asset when more charging takes
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
place over overnight hours so
 
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
briefly on section 1 we find that that
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
is consistent with the final report of
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
517's ev charging station infrastructure
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
commission so we really appreciate
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
senator waters efforts on that um and
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
leadership on this issue as well as
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
efforts by
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative sykes and and smith on
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
that commission
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
we think that appropriately identifies
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
cost barriers section two would
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
you know clarify that ev charging
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
stations that receive public funding
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
should enable universal access which we
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
think is a common sense position
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
and section 3 would enable cities and
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
towns to to make decisions to provide
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
tax relief on the value of evsc which
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
would help to accelerate
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
and incentivize private investments i
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
think it's important to note that the
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
vast majority of all ev
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
charging investments necessary to
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
support electric transportation in new
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire will come from the private
 
00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:10.309 align:start position:0%
hampshire will come from the private
sector

00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
sector
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
and that the state's allocation of
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
volkswagen diesel gate
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
mitigation funds would only ever account
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
for a small fraction of the total
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure investment needed
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
to support ev charging for light medium
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
and heavy duty vehicles
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
i might also follow up on becky oller's
 
00:52:25.119 --> 00:52:25.829 align:start position:0%
i might also follow up on becky oller's
comments

00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
about the lack of responses for new
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire's rfp for ev chargers
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
i'd say that the the absence of
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
qualifying bids shouldn't be viewed as a
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
lack of market interest
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
in of which there is uh significant um
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
however i also wouldn't say that
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
the lack of bids is a failure of des or
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
osi the technology involved with ev
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
charging is rapidly evolving and it's
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
no small feat to design an effective
 
00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.470 align:start position:0%
no small feat to design an effective
program

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
there are examples around the country of
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
states that have tried
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
to issue programs that at first did not
 
00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:55.270 align:start position:0%
to issue programs that at first did not
receive

00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
receive
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
qualifying bids but then they took that
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
as a learning opportunity so it's a step
 
00:52:59.670 --> 00:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
around the process
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
in an evolving technology um the one
 
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:02.790 align:start position:0%
in an evolving technology um the one
piece

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
piece
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
of feedback we give with concerns again
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
is in section four
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
which deals with some of the most
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
critical issues that will be necessary
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
to get right
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
in each of the 50 states is as
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
private investment increases as federal
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
investment opportunities are potentially
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
put on the table and i think one of the
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
key pieces to look at is the way that
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
electricity rates are designed because
 
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
the ongoing operating costs
 
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
for charging infrastructure can be a
 
00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
significant barrier and
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell it's because commercial
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
and industrial
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
electricity rates were designed to treat
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
the big
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
loads like their long term factories
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
that are on for extended periods of time
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
and that's just not how
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
ev charging equipment operates so
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
by charging two types of electricity
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
rates for the volumetric consumption
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
for how much energy is used as well as
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
for how much power could be used at any
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
given time the demand charge
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
you create some imbalanced
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
rates that can really disincentivize
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
investment and actually are increasingly
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
being found to be
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
not cost based in how they assess those
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
costs so
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
i'd echo madeleine's comments that we're
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
looking at these issues
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
at the commission and in fact states
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
around the country are looking at ways
 
00:54:17.839 --> 00:54:18.230 align:start position:0%
around the country are looking at ways
to

00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that utilities can develop
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
alternatives to traditional demand-based
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
rates so i'd be happy to provide the
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
committee with a suggestion that you'd
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
00:54:32.309 --> 00:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
amend paragraph six uh to instead of
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
saying that demand charges are
 
00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.150 align:start position:0%
saying that demand charges are
appropriate

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
great designs to note that actually to
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
the contrary alternatives to traditional
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
demand-based electricity rates may be
 
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate for high demand draw
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
ev supply equipment so providing
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility at the puc and for utilities
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
will be essential to
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
leverage more private investment

my name is regina bertzell state senator
 
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
for district 19
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
which encompasses the towns of derry
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
hampstead and wynton
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
and i am the sponsor of part two
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
which is um it establishes the removal
 
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:48.829 align:start position:0%
which is um it establishes the removal
of

00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
abandoned or just disabled vehicles by
 
00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:51.829 align:start position:0%
abandoned or just disabled vehicles by
towing

00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
towing
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
this was a concerted effort by both the
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
state police
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
and the towing association i'm sure
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
you'll be hearing from both of them
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
to put together some legislation
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
that both could agree with i guess um in
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
the past
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
the whenever a car needs to be towed
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
there has been the
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
agreement between the state police and
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
the towing association there was
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
not an agreement um so
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
to bring some fairness to the
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
towing community
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
they've decided to a lot the new
 
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire state police
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
and the atone association got together
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
and what this bill allows is for the new
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire state police
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
when necessary to call from a rolling
 
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:46.789 align:start position:0%
when necessary to call from a rolling
out

00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah a rolling list of tow
 
00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:50.390 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah a rolling list of tow
companies

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
to arrive to assisted scene um
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
the creation of this rolling list
 
00:59:55.839 --> 00:59:56.870 align:start position:0%
the creation of this rolling list
establishes

00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
establishes
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
uh both a fair and an equitable use of
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
the tow services by the new hampshire
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
state police
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
and it also requires to tow companies on
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
the rolling list to be fed
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
to be vetted and to meet the
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
professional standard requirements to
 
01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.150 align:start position:0%
professional standard requirements to
ensure

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
ensure
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
the safe and reliable total services so
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
again this was an agreement
 
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
um that was long a long time coming
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
between the
 
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
towing association and the new hampshire
 
01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
state police
 
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
and again you're probably i presume the
 
01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:28.549 align:start position:0%
and again you're probably i presume the
towing

01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%

um this was it as senator birdsdale
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
already said this
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
is a bill that was a long time coming uh
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
this does allow for a fair and equitable
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
way for
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
any towing business that wants to tow on
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
behalf of the new hampshire state police
 
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
it it lays a foundation of a the same
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
set of ground rules for everybody
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
as well as a as well as rules to uh
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
protect the public
 
01:03:59.430 --> 01:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh from a tow business that may not be
 
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
acting in the best interest of everyone
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
again this is a long time coming it's
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
something that like we say allows for
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
protection of the towing industry as
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
well as for the
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
general public and it is something that
 
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
the state police has worked uh
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
for a considerable amount of time with
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
the towing association in order to uh
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
to come to something that does benefit
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
everyone i'd be happy to answer any
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
questions that any of the board members
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
may have
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
representative crawford
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
lieutenant for taking my question uh
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
the list it's a rolling list so the
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
troopers would
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
call the first person on that list and
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
if they don't answer they go to the next
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
person or do they give that
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
first person a chance to respond uh in a
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know in a short period of time or
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
how does that work could you explain it
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
to me please
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes so the way that it works is the uh
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
the the calls will actually come from
 
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
our dispatch center so when a trooper on
 
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
the side of the road request a tow truck
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
our dispatch center will contact the uh
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
the first towing company
 
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
at the top of the list and they do give
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
them typically a reasonable amount of
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
time to try and answer that phone call i
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's just an instant
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
three rings and hang up they will try
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
and uh make contact with them they
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
if if they're unable to make a response
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
uh if no one answers the phone they
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
leave a message nobody calls back within
 
01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
a short
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
period of time then they will go on to
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
the next person on the list
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
and work their way through the list that
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
see no other questions from the
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
committee so thank you very much
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for taking
 
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
it awesome okay that's
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
it looks like once you speak to part two
 
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
i'll ask one more time
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh if anybody else wishes to speak to
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%

none so we'll move on to part three
 
01:05:57.599 --> 01:05:58.069 align:start position:0%
none so we'll move on to part three
again

01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair good morning
 
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record i am senator
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
chuck morris i represent senate district
 
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
22 which includes the towns of salem
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
atkinson plaistow and pelham
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
i'm the prime sponsor of part three of
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
senate bill 131
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
which makes a few changes to the salt
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
applicators program
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
i first got involved with the salt
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
applicator program
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
because of the i-93 project
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
which could be up to 20 years ago now as
 
01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
part of the lawsuit regarding the
 
01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:51.910 align:start position:0%
part of the lawsuit regarding the
project

01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
the state was required to reduce the
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
amount of salt
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
runoff impacting local waterways state
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
has been working to use best practices
 
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
to reduce salt use and the current
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
certification program works with private
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
contractors to help reduce
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
their salt usage under current law only
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
private contractors can get the
 
01:07:11.839 --> 01:07:13.109 align:start position:0%
private contractors can get the
certification

01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow the state to
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
certify municipal programs as well
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
in the bill itself sections 2 4
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
and 7 make a few technical changes to
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
the salt applicators program
 
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
mostly to better define the differences
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
between an individual
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
and a subordinate certificate while
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
while the balance of the bill allows the
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities to have their programs
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
certified by des
 
01:07:40.349 --> 01:07:40.359 align:start position:0%
this bill is a win-win for
 
01:07:40.359 --> 01:07:41.750 align:start position:0%
this bill is a win-win for
municipalities

01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
because they will save money through
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
reduced salt usage and it helps to keep
 
01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
our waterways clean
 
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
i know des is on this call and they
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
certainly can answer some technical
 
01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.710 align:start position:0%
certainly can answer some technical
questions

01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%

department of
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
my environmental services in support of
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
um i also um originally allowed him just
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
i just promoted to a panel let's see if
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
good morning all right thank you very
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
much for uh
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
for streaming me in i appreciate that uh
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair members of the committee
 
01:09:17.349 --> 01:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is ted dears and
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
i'm the administrator of the watershed
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
management bureau
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
at the new hampshire department of
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
it's my great pleasure to be with you
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
this morning to talk about
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh sb 131 part three
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh as senator morse so capably
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
it is about adding a municipal component
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
to our voluntary
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
salt applicator certification program
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise and better known as our green
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
snow pros
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
um we have trained uh about 2
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
000 people over the last uh six or seven
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
years in how to protect public safety
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
while reducing the amount of chlorides
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
this amount of salt that goes on our
 
01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:01.590 align:start position:0%
this amount of salt that goes on our
roads

01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
roads
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
this is becoming a major issue in a
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
number of areas around the state
 
01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
where we are losing water supplies due
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
to high salt
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
content we see streams that are greatly
 
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
impacted by high salt
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
and you also it impacts our
 
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it tears up our bridges
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
it tears up our concrete
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh it's expensive for for landowners and
 
01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:24.550 align:start position:0%
uh it's expensive for for landowners and
landscaping

01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
landscaping
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
so these are some of the reasons why
 
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
reducing salt is important this bill is
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
important because
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
it does allow for
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities become certified there
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
are a number of reasons why we heard
 
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
from the municipalities
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
that they want this a couple of them are
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
outlined in my
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
in my letter there's a testimony letter
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
that was sent from the commissioner
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
but the one of the key ones is that
 
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
there are some regulatory requirements
 
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
through an epa permit on stormwater and
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
as part of that permit in areas that are
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
impacted by chlorides
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
they need to essentially have the kind
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
of program that we're offering in place
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
and so by having the certification
 
01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
program it allows them to comply
 
01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
easily with that how we think this is
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
going to work is a little different
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
than our certified uh commercial
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
applicator program in that
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to be certifying entire
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
programs so so a municipal program that
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
actually is that winter maintenance
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
so they'll have certain requirements uh
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
which we'll do some rulemaking to
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
establish by working with the
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders to do that um and it'll
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
basically have many of the same
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
requirements but it'll focus on on sort
 
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
of the broader vision of an entire
 
01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:35.270 align:start position:0%
of the broader vision of an entire
community

01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh looking at making sure that their
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
their applicators
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
the the plow operators are certified
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
that they're trained
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
um that they're doing some accounting of
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
their salt usage
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh that they're calibrating their
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
equipment these are the things that
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
research has shown really dramatically
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
reduces the amount of salt use
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
so now i'm going to stop there and just
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
see if there's
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
any other questions because i know you
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
have a lot of work on your table today
 
01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you sir um let the committee go
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
first any quiet
 
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative thank you mr chair
 
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr dears for your
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
i am interested to know if you
 
01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
anticipate any increased
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh costs for the municipalities
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
in order to participate in these
 
01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.990 align:start position:0%
in order to participate in these
programs

01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um this is
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
a very inexpensive proposition and in
 
01:12:36.239 --> 01:12:37.189 align:start position:0%
a very inexpensive proposition and in
fact

01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
what's been found in most of the
 
01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.390 align:start position:0%
what's been found in most of the
circumstances

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
around the country where people have
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
really gone down this road
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
of of you know doing better calibration
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
of doing better training
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
for their employees in municipal
 
01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:51.590 align:start position:0%
for their employees in municipal
settings

01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
settings
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
is that they end up saving money that
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
these changes
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
more than pay for themselves in reduced
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
chloride use
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
so um even when there's um
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
even when there's equipment purchases
 
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
some people get really advanced into
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
this they where
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
they use different kinds of equipment
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
city of concord has what's called
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
live edge plows which instead of a
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
single blade all across the front of the
 
01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
plow it's built of
 
01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
a number of you know six or seven or
 
01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:19.590 align:start position:0%
a number of you know six or seven or
eight

01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
eight
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
articulated uh sections within that that
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
allows you to get uh
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
as i like to put it it's like a closer
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
shave it's like one blade versus five on
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
your bic
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
razor um with the more blades you get a
 
01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:31.990 align:start position:0%
razor um with the more blades you get a
closer

01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
closer
 
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
shave which reduces the the the the ice
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
even that saves money because they don't
 
01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
have to plow as many times you get a
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
better plow the first time around so
 
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
things like that tend to save money and
 
01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
there will be a fee associated with this
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
to cover administrative costs but it'll
 
01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:49.430 align:start position:0%
to cover administrative costs but it'll
be

01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
pretty nominal the fees that are are
 
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
paid by our
 
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
unit our commercial applicators and we
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
have not set the fee yet that would
 
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
happen during rule making
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
um in cooperation with the
 
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities um
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
are in the few hundred dollar range so
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
and that that's just for training
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
that that kind of cost could be for the
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
training of the staff
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
of the municipality in the road
 
01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.910 align:start position:0%
of the municipality in the road
department

01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question the the
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
way that it works generally is that we
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
have different training programs set up
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that we've done
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
and as part of the overall bill and this
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
happens in a lot of different
 
01:14:30.159 --> 01:14:31.110 align:start position:0%
happens in a lot of different
communities

01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
is that we've set up a mechanism where
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
especially for some of the larger
 
01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:35.750 align:start position:0%
especially for some of the larger
communities

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
they can actually do their own training
 
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
so we have a curriculum that they can
 
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:40.790 align:start position:0%
so we have a curriculum that they can
use

01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
it has a set of of elements that they
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
have to hit within that training a
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
certain amount of time
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
that they have to train for and they can
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
apply to us and we set up an approved
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
training program
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
and you know we find that for a lot of
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
our larger uh both commercial
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
side and i think this will probably be
 
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
the case on the the um
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
on the uh the municipal side as well is
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
that some of these larger communities
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
will do that
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
we also provide training through unh so
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
the t-squared program which many of you
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
are probably familiar with that gets
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
dollars from
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
dot at unh it's that technical transfer
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
program which
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
works with road agents they run the
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
rhodes scholar program
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
through that they also do training on
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance so
 
01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
there are many different options for
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
people to get training thank you
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you mr dears
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you touched
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
this on this briefly um with
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative erin's question
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
you were getting very specific about um
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
equipment and and um different training
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
skills for um operators does it get in
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
does your program get involved with
 
01:15:57.990 --> 01:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
actual products that are
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
put down on the road like i know um in
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
my town they have begun
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
spraying what i think is called brian on
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
the streets is is that considered a
 
01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
greener alternative um so overall you
 
01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:10.310 align:start position:0%
greener alternative um so overall you
know

01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
this program takes in the whole spectrum
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
of everything that can be done to be
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
more environmentally safe
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
great great question and you hit the
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
nail on the head um
 
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
in day indeed the way that we sort of
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
see this program being
 
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
rolled out is in in multiple sort of
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
levels there's going to be
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
i think what i sort of i think about it
 
01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
is kind of a bronze silver gold approach
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
where the bronze approach is going to be
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
just making sure everybody gets trained
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
making sure your equipment is calibrated
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
and make sure you're counting your
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
how much salt you're using then there
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
might be a a silver
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
level which would include beginning to
 
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
dabble in brine
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
brine is incredibly important if you
 
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
really want to
 
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
reduce chlorides brine is critical
 
01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:53.110 align:start position:0%
reduce chlorides brine is critical
because

01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
brine what salt does and this is one of
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
the things that goes on in our training
 
01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:57.990 align:start position:0%
the things that goes on in our training
program

01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
is that the salt isn't really to melt
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
the ice
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
the salt is to keep the ice from
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
adhering to the pavement so that you can
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
plow the ice away
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of using road salt
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
and what brine does is it gets out ahead
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's already on the road and so as that
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
ice starts to form
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
up it has a it has that salt layer
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
underneath which allows it to not adhere
 
01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
and so what it does a couple of things
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
it helps you not have to get out
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
as quickly onto the storm which saves
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
you time
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
and overtime in the morning and
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
oftentimes these storms happen at two
 
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning as
 
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
as you all know um so it saves a little
 
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
time there but it also
 
01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
means that you are more effective in
 
01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
your mechanical plowing
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
um which is what really redu removes the
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
snow and ice
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
so brian is an incredibly important
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
piece and and as communities get more
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
sophisticated in their knowledge
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
then they begin to employ some of those
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
it's not required
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
as part of this but it would be
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
recognized as they
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
increased their sophistication in their
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance activities
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
that they would be rewarded with that
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
through different levels of
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
certification so that's
 
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the idea but again we're
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
going to work through this in rule
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
making with the communities to see
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
what's going to serve them
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
best thank you
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
senator gracie yes thank you mr chairman
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to mention that i was a
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
graduate of the t-square program
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
took a program in utilization of grinds
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
and other things
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
as well as the storm water management uh
 
01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
sections that they have there as well
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
and the contamination of our of our
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
groundwater from
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh from from road salts and i found the
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
program to be very helpful
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
i was very surprised because that
 
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities weren't already being
 
01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:46.470 align:start position:0%
municipalities weren't already being
certified

01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
certified
 
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
i think this is great that you're doing
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
this and i just wanted to say that the
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
program that they did have at the
 
01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:51.830 align:start position:0%
program that they did have at the
university

01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
university
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh in the t-square program is just
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
phenomenal and
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
all the communities that i worked with
 
01:18:57.199 --> 01:18:59.430 align:start position:0%
all the communities that i worked with
did

01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
use alternative methods and reducing
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:05.669 --> 01:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives great to see
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
you again and i think you hit uh hit
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
that on the head is that
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
t-squared does a phenomenal job and in
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
fact recently uh with some changes in
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
leadership they've improved
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
dramatically i think their operations uh
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
we look forward to increasing our
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
interactions and our partnerships with
 
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
them we have partnerships with other
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
people as well we actually have an
 
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
online course that was developed through
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
a group up in ontario
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
um and we're doing a lot of partnerships
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
now with minnesota
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
and uh with new york state on a number
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
of different things so
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee i
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
do have one
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
um representative actually
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
stole some of my thunder talking about
 
01:19:49.679 --> 01:19:51.189 align:start position:0%
stole some of my thunder talking about
the

01:19:51.189 --> 01:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
grinds but more specifically is the pbs
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
doing any research where is magnesium
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
fluoride specifically included in this
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
i know i believe or you could
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but it helps
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
with less
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
salt using the magnesium chloride but
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
does the magnesium chloride itself have
 
01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:18.639 align:start position:0%
any effect on the waterways
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh excellent
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
so what magnesium chloride does is it
 
01:20:25.679 --> 01:20:26.550 align:start position:0%
so what magnesium chloride does is it
allows

01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
allows
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
for uh salt to work at lower
 
01:20:29.679 --> 01:20:30.629 align:start position:0%
for uh salt to work at lower
temperatures

01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:30.639 align:start position:0%
temperatures
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
so regular old rock salt doesn't work at
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
all below about 15 degrees maybe 20
 
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
degrees it depends on the
 
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
atmospheric conditions and how much
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
moisture is out there
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work it has to get into
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
solution and so
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
um if you just if you if it's 15 degrees
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
out and you have a piece of ice and you
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
just throw a rock salt on there it's
 
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
nothing but rock salt
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's not it's nothing but traction at
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
that point just because of the
 
01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
you're better off putting sand down um
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
what magnesium chloride does is it
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
allows you to treat at a lower
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
lower temperature so what most people do
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
and this is a common practice in fact in
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
in concord they
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
they pre-treat their sodium chloride
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
their regular
 
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
rock salt with a a mixture
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
of a little bit of magnesium chloride
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
um and a little bit of some other kind
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
of surfactant um
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
oftentimes what's used is uh basically
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
high fructose corn syrup um so
 
01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
it essentially what it does is it allows
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
you to stick a little bit better to the
 
01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:34.470 align:start position:0%
you to stick a little bit better to the
road

01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
so that you don't see you know in the
 
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
old days and sometimes you do still see
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
you're driving behind a truck that's
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
that's loading out
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
rock salt and that stuff is just
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
bouncing all over and half of it's
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
bouncing off the side of the road
 
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's just waste that's just money down
 
01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:50.639 align:start position:0%
the drain as well as salt into the
 
01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:51.590 align:start position:0%
the drain as well as salt into the
environment

01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
environment
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
so what magnesium chloride does is it
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
helps you to use less
 
01:21:59.189 --> 01:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
sodium chloride at lower temperatures
 
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
now the one problem with magnesium
 
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
chloride for those of you who remember
 
01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:04.639 align:start position:0%
your high school chemistry
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
is that nacl which is sodium chloride
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
only has one chloride attached to each
 
01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:10.070 align:start position:0%
only has one chloride attached to each
molecule

01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
molecule
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
of sodium magnesium chloride is
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
magnesium chloride two
 
01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:16.719 align:start position:0%
and so there are two chlorides to every
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
molecule of magnesium
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
so if you were to use the same amounts
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
of magnesium chloride and sodium
 
01:22:23.669 --> 01:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
chloride you'd actually be putting down
 
01:22:23.679 --> 01:22:23.990 align:start position:0%
chloride you'd actually be putting down
twice

01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
twice
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
the chlorides and it's chloride which is
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
toxic to fish
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
so what you what ends up happening is
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
this is why you use these in in
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
in very specific amounts and it
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
and what concrete has found and what
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
other communities have found is that by
 
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
doing this sort of
 
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
mix and also by pre-wetting their sodium
 
01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
chloride sometimes what you'll see is a
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
are are saddle tanks on the backs of
 
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
these spreaders
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
that actually squirt a little bit of
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
water onto the ice onto the salt
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
before it goes out onto the street and
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
that gets it going into solution
 
01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
it kind of does the same thing so it's a
 
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
really important component
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
to what people are doing but yet this is
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
things that you learn in our classes is
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
that you have to do that in the right
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
way if you're
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
actually going to reduce your chloride
 
01:23:12.159 --> 01:23:14.629 align:start position:0%
actually going to reduce your chloride
use

01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
well i'll give myself a follow-up you
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
didn't answer my question it is
 
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
specifically covered in the
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
certification process
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
i won't go any further on
 
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
magnesium chloride i've done a lot of
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
research on it what it does to our
 
01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:29.350 align:start position:0%
research on it what it does to our
infrastructure

01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
and our vehicles is devastating in my
 
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.390 align:start position:0%
and our vehicles is devastating in my
opinion

01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
is the department looking at maybe
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
things that work
 
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
as well to reduce salt that may not be
 
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
as plastic
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
or corrosive as magnesium chloride
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
sure that's a great question and i
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate it this is an
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
area in which this is one of the key
 
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
places that i'm having conversations
 
01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:52.790 align:start position:0%
places that i'm having conversations
with

01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:23:56.229 --> 01:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
my uh my colleagues throughout the
 
01:23:56.239 --> 01:23:57.270 align:start position:0%
my uh my colleagues throughout the
country

01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
is we do not have a great capacity
 
01:24:04.149 --> 01:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
for at like like a a chloride
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
alternative test bed somewhere
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
this is something that i've raised with
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
senator shaheen
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
in meetings with her i have other other
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
states are raising that with their
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
federal representatives is that we don't
 
01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:17.750 align:start position:0%
federal representatives is that we don't
have

01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
like one place you can go where there's
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
a test bed
 
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
of new products there are all kinds of
 
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
interesting products out there out in
 
01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:26.070 align:start position:0%
interesting products out there out in
duluth

01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
duluth
 
01:24:28.709 --> 01:24:28.719 align:start position:0%
they use potassium acetate on their
 
01:24:28.719 --> 01:24:29.430 align:start position:0%
they use potassium acetate on their
bridges

01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
bridges
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
for the very same reason that you
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
suggest that using
 
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
any kind of chloride product has the
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
potential to cause a
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
corrosion so this is an incredibly
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
important area of research we would love
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
to see unh get
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
involved in some of that kind of
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
research um
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
and and this is one of the things that
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about with our federal
 
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh compatriots is to see if we could
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
somehow set up
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
kind of this third party testing ability
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
as they do in other technologies
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
to see if there's some ways that we can
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
improve that there are places out in
 
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
wisconsin they use
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
cheese waste in minnesota they use beer
 
01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:09.270 align:start position:0%
cheese waste in minnesota they use beer
waste

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
waste
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
or vice versa whichever part of the
 
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
country you have to be in
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
um you know so there are some of those
 
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
um and the question is is what are the
 
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
downsides of some of that
 
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
those products and that's that's what
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
really it is a little bit of a wild wild
 
01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
west out there where there's some people
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
selling snake oil
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
um and you know so that that i think
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
that that this is a major challenge that
 
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
we need to address as a nation
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
thanks for letting me go off the rails a
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
little bit uh i see representative erin
 
01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much mr chairman and
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
mr dears
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
i have a question about um if you if you
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
might want to
 
01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
clarify or talk a little bit about this
 
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
liability that's limited for winter
 
01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:54.470 align:start position:0%
liability that's limited for winter
maintenance

01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
section here it seems to me
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
talks about that if if municipality
 
01:26:06.070 --> 01:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
gets itself certified that it will help
 
01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
alleviate any uh liability for
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps accidents happening on the road
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
or can you
 
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
clarify that a little for me yes thank
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
you representative this
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
this is uh this is an important issue
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
this is one of the things that was
 
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
key uh in the uh commercial assault
 
01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:24.390 align:start position:0%
key uh in the uh commercial assault
applicator

01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
applicator
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh legislation so i just want to just
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
sort of give the history here real quick
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
before we jump into
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
this current bill and so one of the
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
things that we heard from contractors
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
is that the slip and fall cases were one
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why they over salted
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
because if anybody went out there they
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to show that not only had they
 
01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
done what they were supposed to do
 
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
they were going to have so much salt
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
that you couldn't see the ground for
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
there was so much salt there's no way
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
that anybody could prove that they were
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
at fault in a slip and fall case
 
01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
and that's just more salt that's needed
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's just waste
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
um and so we put this liability
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
provision in
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
um and again thanks to senator morse uh
 
01:27:04.229 --> 01:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
for for getting that through um
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
and it's it's it's unique in the nation
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
there are many other states that are
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
trying to get this into place
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
um for the very same reasons that we did
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
and it's based kind of on the ski area
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that says that the ski areas
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
are doing base they're not negligent you
 
01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
can't sue them
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
for you know slipping and falling on a
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
mountain because the whole point
 
01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
is to slip and fall down a mountain um
 
01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
so you know this
 
01:27:28.229 --> 01:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
is um the the history of that what we
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
is that you know municipalities like the
 
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
state already have sovereign immunity
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
so they really can't be sued for slip
 
01:27:37.110 --> 01:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
and fall cases
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
if they're doing what they're supposed
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
to be doing that is they're not
 
01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:41.350 align:start position:0%
to be doing that is they're not
negligent

01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
negligent
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
so what we wanted to make sure was by
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
doing this bill by having the
 
01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.310 align:start position:0%
doing this bill by having the
certification

01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't somehow
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
mess up their sovereign immunity and so
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
that's what that line in that section is
 
01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:54.709 align:start position:0%
that's what that line in that section is
about

01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that that that just
 
01:27:58.950 --> 01:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
because they're getting trained and
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
using less salt
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't make them any more liable for
 
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
for slip and fall cases and this we ran
 
01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:05.510 align:start position:0%
for slip and fall cases and this we ran
back

01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
the the new hampshire municipal
 
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
association to make sure that this is
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh that this was appropriate for the
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
communities before this went forward and
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
and certainly in the in the senate um
 
01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh municipal association uh testified in
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for for that
 
01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:24.790 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for for that
absolutely

01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.560 align:start position:0%

much have a great day
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
it was um any other questions
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
on section three of the build if you do
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
raise your hand down please
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
see our list of attendees is shrinking
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
and i see no other hand so we'll move on
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
to section four
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%

eligibility for issuance of the
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
non-drivers picture identification card
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh senator waters has already introduced
 
01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:08.790 align:start position:0%
uh senator waters has already introduced
it

01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
i do know that uh representative sykes
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
is also on the bill if you'd like to
 
01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:14.070 align:start position:0%
is also on the bill if you'd like to
speak

01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%

01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
i'll ask anybody to raise their hands
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman i only caught part of
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
what you were saying
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
to me or about me could you repeat that
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
oh sure i've just given you the
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity i know you're a co-sponsor
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
and i know senator
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
i mean senator waters had to leave i
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
didn't know if he wanted to
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
to speak a little bit on this or not if
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
not i'm just trying to move it to the
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
next speaker
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
yeah and they'll move to the next
 
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
speaker i think that senator waters did
 
01:29:57.510 --> 01:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
a decent job of introducing
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
she recognizes uh director leckie
 
01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.070 align:start position:0%
she recognizes uh director leckie
elizabeth

01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
elizabeth
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
from the department of motor vehicles
 
01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
she may be here for this one i'm not
 
01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:26.229 align:start position:0%
she may be here for this one i'm not
sure

01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman members of the
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee how are you doing this morning
 
01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
good morning how are you um thank you
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
for recognizing me
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
i think senator waters really did a
 
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
great job introducing this section of
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
the bill as well we have requested
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
the addition of this language for a
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
the main one being as we are moving
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
forward with the implementation of the
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
state-to-state verification system
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
alongside many other states it's really
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
critical that we don't have
 
01:30:59.350 --> 01:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
credentials or instances where people
 
01:30:59.360 --> 01:30:59.830 align:start position:0%
credentials or instances where people
hold

01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
hold
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
two valid credentials in the state of
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
being a valid driver's license as well
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
as a valid non-driver
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
identification card that really makes
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
the implementation of the state-state
 
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
system a lot easier
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
and a lot easier to manage when new
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
move out of state as well so with that
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
i'll um
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
just open um it up to any questions that
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
the committee might have
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you director any questions from
 
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you director bolecki i
 
01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:36.320 align:start position:0%

01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
section about the disposition of
 
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
fees um is that just because you're
 
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
taking out this section
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
about the the granite state i forget
 
01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
what it's called now
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
the advantage program um which was for
 
01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
senior citizens or
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
the the part about committee on aging
 
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
um you are well you are correct it is
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
the card issued if you can if you look
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
back to
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
section or paragraph three section two
 
01:32:07.590 --> 01:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh under identification card it does
 
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
recognize that pursuant to rsa 260 21 1c
 
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
that golden granite state discount card
 
01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:14.470 align:start position:0%
that golden granite state discount card
was

01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
issued so there was a fee related to
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
that that was
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
um that was divided out in accordance
 
01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
with that section
 
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
in section three so i think it's just
 
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
removing and cleaning up
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
any references related to the language
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's being deleted
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and oh follow up
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
thank you i just wanted to clarify that
 
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
um we spoke yesterday about what i
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
brought up with senator waters about
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
removing the line about
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
our disabled residents and you would
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
agree that that would be um
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't affect the intent of the
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
section yes and thank you for bringing
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
that up i think that's a great catch and
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
it's a nice way to really clarify the
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
um so i think it just simplifies it and
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
yes i reviewed and i don't have
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
any issues with the proposed language
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%

01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%

01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%

state police i thank you for the
 
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify this morning i'll
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
be very brief
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
this portion of senate bill 131
 
01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
i consider housekeeping in its truest
 
01:35:30.629 --> 01:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
sense if you look at the language that
 
01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
is being deleted
 
01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
it simply is referring to the phase-in
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
process of the statute that required
 
01:35:37.679 --> 01:35:38.709 align:start position:0%
process of the statute that required
voters

01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:35:42.149 --> 01:35:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh to get a a certificate
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
showing a proof of boating education uh
 
01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
that has long since
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
passed going back to 2008 so now
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
when voters look at the statute
 
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
attorneys as well as the courts
 
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh it actually creates a little bit of
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
confusion as to why those dates are
 
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
still there
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
so by eliminating the dates and just
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
simply saying you need the certificate
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
which is indeed the case now uh it
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
eliminates a bunch of confusion
 
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
and again it's truly just a housekeeping
 
01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
measure and i'm happy to answer any
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
thanks again thank you very much uh
 
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
five let's see no hands raised so we'll
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%

as this was just as the the full time
 
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
and the volunteer firefighters were made
 
01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:34.390 align:start position:0%
and the volunteer firefighters were made
available

01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
for last last i believe this was last
 
01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:37.750 align:start position:0%
for last last i believe this was last
session

01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
um this work was done so this is to
 
01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
allow for ems to have the decals for
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
their plates
 
01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:48.159 align:start position:0%
and i wrote language i i found it
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
actually something that
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be changed but i wrote the
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
language that would allow emergency
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
medical services chiefs and fire chiefs
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
um to issue this to current members or
 
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
retired members because
 
01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
not all ems is delivered different ways
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
in the states sometimes it's under a
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
fire department
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's an a soul it's a a
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
completely different entity so
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
the fire chiefs would still need to have
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
um their say
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
in issuing these um these decals and i
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
also if i may um chairman walsh i
 
01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
recognized recently that in
 
01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
um so on line 9
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
under this section um this multi-use
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
decal plate on a motor vehicle
 
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
owned and registered by an emergency
 
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
services personnel it should be
 
01:38:40.229 --> 01:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
mirror what the firefighters part
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
section which is owned
 
01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
it has to be registered but should be
 
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
owned or leased um and i did not include
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
least when i when i wrote the language
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
and i honestly just
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
just recently caught that yep
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
does anybody wish anybody else wish to
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
speak on
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
any section of the bill actually that's
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
my uh last hand raised
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
we missed you before going through the
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
sections now's the time
 
01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
or this section now is the time
 
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm going to close the
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
public hearing on
 
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:36.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:40.629 --> 01:39:40.639 align:start position:0%
that was interesting yeah
 
01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
um the only other agenda item i have
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
today we are certainly not going to try
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
to execute this today
 
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
i do have the room scheduled for next
 
01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.510 align:start position:0%
i do have the room scheduled for next
tuesday

01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
tuesday
 
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
um what time i haven't decided yet but
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
it will be next tuesday get a lot of
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
possibly one last minor amendment and
 
01:40:01.119 --> 01:40:02.550 align:start position:0%
possibly one last minor amendment and
correction

01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
correction
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh the only thing i've got that we can
 
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
go over now as far as committee business
 
01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:06.950 align:start position:0%
go over now as far as committee business
site

01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
site
 
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
everybody receive the side by sides for
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
the bills that have been
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
and the way this works i just want to
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
follow the committee obviously
 
01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
either have to concur non-concur
 
01:40:35.590 --> 01:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
or uh non-concur requested committee
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
conference the changes that they've made
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
in my opinion are pretty simple we can
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
go over them real quick if you'd like
 
01:40:45.669 --> 01:40:45.679 align:start position:0%
i did also just discover this morning a
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
couple of problems potentially
 
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
and so what i guess what i'm looking at
 
01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
is uh i'll
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'll go through these and let me know if
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
anybody objects to was concurring that's
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
a good way to start
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh health spill 100 which is the
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
crossing the painted line i guess before
 
01:41:07.590 --> 01:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
i do this has everybody seen it do i
 
01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
raise our hands
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
does anybody did everybody get the email
 
01:41:10.639 --> 01:41:14.070 align:start position:0%
does anybody did everybody get the email
yeah

01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay committed all right well i can run
 
01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
it by quick
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
and again this is non-binding uh it's
 
01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
just a polling of the committee
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh anyway uh the that's the ability to
 
01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
cross this a solid
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
painted line uh the senate removed the
 
01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:29.990 align:start position:0%
painted line uh the senate removed the
name

01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
name
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
chapman which is typical we we don't
 
01:41:33.119 --> 01:41:34.310 align:start position:0%
chapman which is typical we we don't
usually

01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
usually
 
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
name and statute our laws we nickname
 
01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:38.390 align:start position:0%
name and statute our laws we nickname
them

01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
so taking that out i have no problem
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
with personally
 
01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
and it also adds wheelchairs
 
01:41:48.550 --> 01:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
or mobility scooter or devices to that
 
01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:49.510 align:start position:0%
or mobility scooter or devices to that
section

01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
so they're included in a reason to be
 
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
able to cross that line
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
so myself i'm leaning towards the concur
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
i see no issue
 
01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
with the changes made by the senate we
 
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh house bill 174 the cap bill
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
notoriously um the only change they made
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
there was
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
again they removed the name of the bill
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh that the name of the cat
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
arrow so it'll only be nicknamed
 
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
arrow's law it won't be in our statues
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:28.149 --> 01:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
okay the senate may change and these are
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
the only two i have i'm still waiting
 
01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
for 251 they haven't voted on that
 
01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
the senate is still holding on to house
 
01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
bill 222
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
and 224
 
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
i guess just to see what we do with this
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
one apparently
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
um welcome to the end of the process
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately i was looking through
 
01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
423 and 424 they made changes
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh 423 to remove two senators added
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh somebody from the municipal
 
01:42:59.189 --> 01:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
association unfortunately totals eight
 
01:42:59.199 --> 01:43:00.629 align:start position:0%
association unfortunately totals eight
people

01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh 424. they went to one senator from
 
01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:05.430 align:start position:0%
uh 424. they went to one senator from
two

01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
added uh somebody from the cellular
 
01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
telecommunications and internet
 
01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:09.350 align:start position:0%
telecommunications and internet
association

01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
or a designee which is fine a member of
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
the public appointed by the speaker
 
01:43:16.709 --> 01:43:16.719 align:start position:0%
fine uh unless i made a mistake i see
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
that one evening eight people too
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
typically committee should be a mod
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
these are steady committees um if i can
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
get some advice that the
 
01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
odd number isn't that important i'll
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
reach out to you
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
with that opinion this is 423
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
423 24. unless i got it wrong this
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
morning before we started
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh i with the changes they both equal
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
the number of people on the committee so
 
01:43:51.990 --> 01:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's just not usually how it's done
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
so i want to confirm those before we
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
pull those
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully i'll get an answer before
 
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
however i don't even know if we're going
 
01:44:03.510 --> 01:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
to have an answer on the other three
 
01:44:05.669 --> 01:44:05.679 align:start position:0%
that they're holding by tuesday
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
so those we might have to do remote
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
after in terms of getting an opinion
 
01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
on the committee before we get to the
 
01:44:13.590 --> 01:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
house where ask the house
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
what they want to do mr chairman
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um who
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
from whom are you asking an opinion
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
about the even numbered
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh members of us of a study committee
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
yeah i was going to check with
 
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
leadership or what's your opinion
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
do you think it matters no i just i i
 
01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
i mean it just all it will do is uh
 
01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
when an even number would be most most
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
often these types of commissions and
 
01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:43.270 align:start position:0%
often these types of commissions and
committees

01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
offer resolutions to be included in the
 
01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:49.189 align:start position:0%
offer resolutions to be included in the
report

01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
and they vote on them and if it's an
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
even number and it comes out
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
high unexpectedly the the motion would
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
still fail
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
so i mean it's not it's not an
 
01:44:58.320 --> 01:44:59.830 align:start position:0%
so i mean it's not it's not an
insurmountable

01:44:59.830 --> 01:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
insurmountable
 
01:45:02.310 --> 01:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
problem again i don't think it is i i
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
mean i i
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
if it's not an issue whether i check
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
with the speaker or the clerk
 
01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
i'm okay i'm okay with working with them
 
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
the way they are they are just studying
 
01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
commissions yeah
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
in my five terms on the transportation
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
committee this is the first time we've
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
ever had an odd number it's always been
 
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
an even number of
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know representatives yeah it's
 
01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
always been true that's true on the
 
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
committee itself you're right yeah and
 
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
the committee itself it's always been 20
 
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
you know and it just is what it is so
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
anyways my
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
my point is that i don't think it's a
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
insurmountable problem no i think it's
 
01:45:35.590 --> 01:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
not a problem
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
personally i'm certainly not
 
01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
recommending that you not concur
 
01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
okay they're fine and should move on so
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:48.629 --> 01:45:48.639 align:start position:0%
i have a quick question sorry mr
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
chairman just a quick question
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
um i'm just curious if you or
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative sykes or anyone who's
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
been around
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
had an opinion on the member of a public
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
being appointed to house bill 424 i i
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
know i was listening to the hearing that
 
01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
day and there was a little bit of a
 
01:46:04.159 --> 01:46:05.109 align:start position:0%
day and there was a little bit of a
discussion

01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
has are there committees that are
 
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
established that just have a
 
01:46:11.189 --> 01:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
generic member of the public without any
 
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
what their interest should be yeah i
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
have seen them before
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion on it when the
 
01:46:19.590 --> 01:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
senate made their changes
 
01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
um they were going to actually have the
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
senate president
 
01:46:26.229 --> 01:46:26.239 align:start position:0%
appoint one as well uh but i didn't see
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
that in there but
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
it just gives the speaker a little
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
levity to find somebody that you know
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
fill the seat and that will fit in with
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
the uh with the committee there again i
 
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
think they were looking for the odd
 
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
number but just didn't have somebody on
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
okay thanks i don't see it as a big deal
 
01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
i've already mentioned uh
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
to the speaker that he's got an
 
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
