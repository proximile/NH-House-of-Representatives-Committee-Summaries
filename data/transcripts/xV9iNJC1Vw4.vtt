00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.149 align:start position:0%
99 so looking back at the docket Senate
Bill

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 align:start position:0%
499 was in the Senate Health and Human
 
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
Services committee it came out of that
 
00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 align:start position:0%
committee 5 to0 came out of then the
 
00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 align:start position:0%
Senate finance committee 7 to0 came out
 
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
of the Senate with an a to pass with
 
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment on a Voice
 
00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 align:start position:0%
vote when it came to the house it was
 
00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 align:start position:0%
actually vacated by the chairman of the
 
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
House Education committee on a Voice
 
00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 align:start position:0%
vote on March 28th so when this bill
 
00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 align:start position:0%
came over it was offered essentially to
 
00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 align:start position:0%
the house education committee as I read
 
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
the docket it was um
 
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
vacated and then it came directly to
 
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 align:start position:0%
finance and then here to division
 
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
three last week there was a joint
 
00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
meeting between divisions two which
 
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
oversees the education portion of the
 
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
budget and division three and we met for
 
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
probably a little over an hour on House
 
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 499 uh taking in very helpful
 
00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
testimony on those that were interested
 
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 align:start position:0%
and those that had
 
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
information after that meeting
 
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
there was an understanding that division
 
00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 align:start position:0%
two would meet separately on the
 
00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
education portion of this
 
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
bill because it is in two parts it's a
 
00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
education piece and then there is a
 
00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 align:start position:0%
elderly Affairs
 
00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.470 align:start position:0%
elderly Affairs
piece

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
piece
 
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
um it was decided division two would
 
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
meet on the education piece and division
 
00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
three would meet on the elderly Affairs
 
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
piece a subsequent to that meeting the
 
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 align:start position:0%
division 2 meeting did not take place as
 
00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
I understand there was agreement that
 
00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
they they would not meet I don't know
 
00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
the the details fully but that's what
 
00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
happened so now here we are at our
 
00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
scheduled time on Senate Bill
 
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
499 uh we may recall uh the meeting the
 
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
work session from last week and it was
 
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
of very detailed and there's a lot to
 
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
this bill in terms of both cost
 
00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh the fiscal note in various categories
 
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
the policy contained within about the
 
00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
different programs being proposed it is
 
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
complexed and now it comes to us who
 
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
will give a recommendation our job today
 
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
is to give a recommendation for the full
 
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
finance committee house finance
 
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
committee to take a vote on uh
 
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 align:start position:0%
incidentally too I just want to mention
 
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
that all bills all of these bills have
 
00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 align:start position:0%
to be out by May 16th so here we are
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
with that background and um the
 
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
understanding uh of what occurred since
 
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
our last meeting does anyone want to say
 
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
anything or add anything to anything
 
00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
I've said representative
 
00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:16.759 align:start position:0%
tarki I don't know if this would be a a
 
00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
question for you as the sitting chair or
 
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
the chair of Finance but how is this
 
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
actually going to work in terms of each
 
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
division um coming out with a
 
00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation and
 
00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
then how we bring it to the full
 
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 align:start position:0%
committee do you have any Clarity on
 
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
that they split the bill up and so
 
00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 align:start position:0%
division 2 is going to bring their piece
 
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
of it and then division three will bring
 
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
their piece of it and we'll vote on them
 
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
separately similar to like divide the
 
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
question on the floor yeah okay so can I
 
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
ask a question though on that sure
 
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
procedurally one of clarification are
 
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
you sure about that yeah that's my
 
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
understanding was different education
 
00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 align:start position:0%
committee had passed P passed it off to
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
us no we're talking about division two
 
00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 align:start position:0%
and division division two division two
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
sorry they're going to make make
 
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations it's going to be on the
 
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
on the calendar we're going to vote on
 
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
with two different
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
pieces okay but they've already amended
 
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
it so in effect we're voting on
 
00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 align:start position:0%
amendments right but it's a single Bill
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
and as I think represent tki was
 
00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
pointing out if it's going to be two
 
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
different pieces it needs to be split on
 
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
the floor correct cor no if
 
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
if what I was informed of first is the
 
00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
amendment was going to eliminate the
 
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
first half and then we'll have the
 
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
second half in another amendment and
 
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
that's what will be probably come before
 
00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
the full committee okay so can you
 
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
actually clarify that a little further
 
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
about the first half of the bill so we
 
00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
can understand where we're at and so the
 
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
people in the audience will understand
 
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
what happened to the first half of the
 
00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 align:start position:0%
bill well a couple of things on that um
 
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know if division 2 has plans
 
00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
before the 15th or before we meet as a
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
full house finance committee to meet
 
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 align:start position:0%
again on this bill that I do not know
 
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
and I think that goes to a huge part of
 
00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
your question um I know that the bill is
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
in our possession I also know that uh we
 
00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 align:start position:0%
can start the discussion right away
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
leading to what representative Wier was
 
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
talking about an amendment is going to
 
00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
be proposed that uh representative
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
Edwards has organized
 
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
with regards to the second half of the
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
bill so why don't we distribute that
 
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment now if we could Mr
 
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
Ripple so this is amendment
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
2024 hyphen
 
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.029 align:start position:0%
2024 hyphen
1650

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
1650
 
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
H and I'm familiar enough with it uh in
 
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
a meeting I had with representative
 
00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 align:start position:0%
okay I while everyone is reviewing it
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
this is um essentially what the
 
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.550 align:start position:0%
this is um essentially what the
amendment

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
does in the
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
bill as we
 
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
start with the Human Service section so
 
00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
that's on page three section four line
 
00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:31.070 align:start position:0%
that's on page three section four line
six

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
there is a provision in
 
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
here that would
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
simplify the elderly Snap
 
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:41.560 align:start position:0%
application for participating in the
 
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
elderly simplified application project
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
with the supplemental nutrition
 
00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:47.589 align:start position:0%
with the supplemental nutrition
assistance

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
program there was discussion that this
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
is a critical piece of the bill because
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
it uh would allow those who access this
 
00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.990 align:start position:0%
it uh would allow those who access this
application

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
to not have to continuously reapply
 
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
which has become quite cumbersome and it
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
sounds like that's rather urgent in
 
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
terms of uh this particular section of
 
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.350 align:start position:0%
terms of uh this particular section of
the

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
bill so the amendment before you would
 
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
replace the entire
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
bill with just that
 
00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
portion with just that section four on
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
page three
 
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:32.919 align:start position:0%
uh the appropriation then would be the
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
sum of
 
00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.909 align:start position:0%
sum of
$37,500

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:36.919 align:start position:0%
$37,500
 
00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
ending uh fiscal year June 30th
 
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:43.720 align:start position:0%
2025 in order to streamline that
 
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.430 align:start position:0%
2025 in order to streamline that
application

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
process uh for those that need that
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
elderly simplified
 
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
application so
 
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
that is the uh
 
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment essentially addressing
 
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
the division three part of this
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
bill and uh again you'll notice that it
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
replaces the entire bill so as for the
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
division 2 portion or the education
 
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
portion uh that would not be included in
 
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
version representative priest uh thank
 
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question again for
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
clarification you're basically uh
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
striking out all the bill that relates
 
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
to school age children and disabilities
 
00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0%
and replacing this that just pertains to
 
00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:46.550 align:start position:0%
and replacing this that just pertains to
the

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.269 align:start position:0%
the
elderly

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
correct representative
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
Stringham so the HHS portion of the bill
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
had two specific sections that we were
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
to address uh one one of which appears
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
unchanged which is um the change of uh
 
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
eligibility or
 
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
requalification uh for the snap program
 
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.870 align:start position:0%
requalification uh for the snap program
the

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
$37,500 is consistent with the figure
 
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
that we were told uh would be needed to
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
implement that and in fact we were told
 
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
that uh because of reduced paperwork and
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
so on with people not having to
 
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.269 align:start position:0%
so on with people not having to
re-qualify

00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
re-qualify
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh we may end up
 
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
actually finding that to be way to even
 
00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:37.519 align:start position:0%
much more money we may actually save
 
00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:39.639 align:start position:0%
money in the long run by having a
 
00:10:43.069 --> 00:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
three-year versus a one-year
 
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
requalification so what is taken out so
 
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
really what this bill is is not about
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
this part which is the same as the
 
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
original Bill and uh was passed
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
unanimously in the Senate but what this
 
00:10:59.949 --> 00:10:59.959 align:start position:0%
takes out is the whole summer
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
um EBT
 
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
program uh the EBT program provides um
 
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh some supplemental funds for for uh
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
children in need over the summer at the
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
rate of I think $10 a week uh that loads
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
onto a card um the the money for running
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
that part of the program uh comes from a
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
federal federal government but the money
 
00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
that we would need to appropriate is uh
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
putting in the infrastructure necessary
 
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
for us to be able to implement that
 
00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
program which was something like
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
$780,000 or maybe slightly less than
 
00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:42.990 align:start position:0%
$780,000 or maybe slightly less than
that

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.230 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
um so um but in in that ballpark so I I
 
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
really think the discussion for us as
 
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
division 3 ought to be about the EBT
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
program and whether that's something
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
that um we want to match the Senate and
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
support or whether whether uh it's the
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
position uh the recommendation that we
 
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
would make to the full committee uh to
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
jettison that so if we don't want to
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
jettison it then we just um don't accept
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment I vote down this
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
amendment assuming it's even introduced
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
I think right now we're just discussing
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
it it's not formally being being done uh
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing you're talking about I'm
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
a little confused of how the doe part of
 
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
it would get get put back into the bill
 
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
my guess is that they would amend this
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
amendment uh and put back in all all the
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
elements of the first section when they
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
meet or we do it at full finance
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
committee somehow this this thing has
 
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
bill has to get put back together if
 
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
it's torn apart in sections so uh in
 
00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
terms of the EBT program you know I
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
thought it sounded pretty reasonable
 
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
and um uh and you know I was inclined to
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
support it so um uh you know in in
 
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
general I don't think this particular
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
amendments uh need needs to be put
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
forward but that's I'll just throw that
 
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
started thank you for that and that does
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
lead to further clarification so section
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
four of the bill page three begins on
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
line six
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
however there are two paragraphs there
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
one does relate to Summer EBT the other
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
to the elderly simplified application
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:42.519 align:start position:0%
165h is only including the elderly
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
simplified application part of section 4
 
00:13:50.749 --> 00:13:50.759 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 499 representative
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
hle sure thank you so I'm looking at the
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note for this and I believe I
 
00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
heard testimony relative to all the
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
sections of this bill that were not
 
00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
funded with General funds or were funded
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
at a single dollar that the department
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
could of Ed could not Implement those
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
policies during that and I grant granted
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
that section of the bill is is over with
 
00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
division too but I do believe we heard
 
00:14:17.069 --> 00:14:17.079 align:start position:0%
that none of those policies could be
 
00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:18.519 align:start position:0%
implemented because we did not fund
 
00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:20.839 align:start position:0%
those in this
 
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
bill this question is either for the
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
chair for Mr Ripple right the
 
00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:27.959 align:start position:0%
$499 right the reduced lunch that was
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
still during the academic year correct
 
00:14:32.749 --> 00:14:32.759 align:start position:0%
that was not during the summer that's
 
00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:36.759 align:start position:0%
correct yes so I don't believe there was
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
any funding for the summer EBT cards in
 
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
this program
 
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
correct there is funding for the summer
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
EBT program it's an open warrant to HHS
 
00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
in the language currently and that's
 
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah and that was estimated at
 
00:14:54.749 --> 00:14:54.759 align:start position:0%
about 1.1 million in fiscal
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.150 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
wer when we first went through the bill
 
00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of loose ends because
 
00:15:10.269 --> 00:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
the uh School launch program now is
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
basically funded mostly by the federal
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
funds up to 185% of poverty this was
 
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
going to go much further they didn't
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
give us a good count of how many people
 
00:15:22.829 --> 00:15:22.839 align:start position:0%
that would involve I look in my notes I
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
don't see anybody identifying a number
 
00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
and I don't see it in the fiscal note of
 
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
It's kind kind of open-ended
 
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
and why why are we deciding that this
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
whole new group needs to be funded and
 
00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:40.519 align:start position:0%
at that point there would be no federal
 
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
help because they would only help up to
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
185% then anything we want to do above
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
that we're on our own and it would all
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
be State funds from education trust fund
 
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
or wherever and do we really have that
 
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
big a hunga problem in this state that I
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
don't think they properly Pro such
 
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
things nor could they put a number on it
 
00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
nor could they and then some of these
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
things like after the Bell so there are
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
some children that must be having a a
 
00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.230 align:start position:0%
some children that must be having a a
free

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
free
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
breakfast and then there's other
 
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
children that come in after the bell and
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
and that whole arrangement of who was
 
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
going to what what was the type of food
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
was it going to be in a refrigerator
 
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
were they going to pick it up going down
 
00:16:21.389 --> 00:16:21.399 align:start position:0%
the hall to the to the home room or how
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
was it going to work out and that wasn't
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
carefully thought out was it going to be
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
warm was it going to be cold could
 
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
anybody just grab it on the way uh you
 
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
weren't really picking out who could
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
take it and who couldn't unless you want
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
to have employees everywhere to make
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
sure the right people got the right food
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
and it just seemed to needlessly
 
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
complicate everything without really
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
spelling out how it would be done it
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
just seemed like it wasn't a
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
well-developed bill at one
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
point the chairman of division 2 said
 
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
this sounds like it needs to go to
 
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
interim study and uh he was he was
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
pretty sure there was as was I there was
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
a lot of loose end
 
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't think he wanted to move
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
forward with what he had anyway that was
 
00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
that was why we thought of all right
 
00:17:08.909 --> 00:17:08.919 align:start position:0%
there is one good piece in here that's
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
taking the one-year renewal to two
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
three-year renewal and that's worth
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
keeping and that's basically what the
 
00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:16.750 align:start position:0%
keeping and that's basically what the
amendment

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
does representative tarki thank you very
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair with all respect to
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
Chairman Wier um the section that this
 
00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
division is supposed to address has
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the school lunch
 
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
program during the school year that was
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
the division
 
00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:35.799 align:start position:0%
2's um focus our focus is solely on
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
summer EBT which has nothing to do with
 
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and division
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
2 and the simplified elderly application
 
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
now with that I'm wondering if it's
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
possible to have New Hampshire hunger
 
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
Solutions uh perhaps come and help us
 
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
understand a little bit I was chatting
 
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
with um M milikin uh last week
 
00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:03.799 align:start position:0%
about how some of this um what's left in
 
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
the bill what we're looking at and
 
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:09.799 align:start position:0%
exactly what it is that's that we're
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
looking at and how it's funded is there
 
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:23.799 align:start position:0%
order but would you mind if I just
 
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
recognized representative Leon prior to
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
recognizing thank you Lon thank you
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
madam chair um sorry that I'm just
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
jumping into this and I wasn't in your
 
00:18:36.149 --> 00:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
PR previous meetings but I know in my
 
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
town in Dair there's several locations
 
00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:40.039 align:start position:0%
where they offer the lunches during the
 
00:18:42.909 --> 00:18:42.919 align:start position:0%
summer um to children and those who
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
qualify for them with the summer EBT
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
program replac that so that instead of
 
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
having those lunches available um at the
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
fairways and other locations it would
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
EBT representative tki um those summer
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
program prrs are um often times uh
 
00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:06.039 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and not affiliated with
 
00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:09.799 align:start position:0%
DHHS um the summer school program has a
 
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
lunch program for those students who are
 
00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
enrolled in summer school that's
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
different summer EBT as I'm sure someone
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
could help um Enlighten us with more
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
specifics is simply um an additional
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
SNAP program that families would receive
 
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
for children who qualify for the
 
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
month okay thank you for that all right
 
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:46.669 align:start position:0%
month okay thank you for that all right
Miss

00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
milikin hello good afternoon um I did do
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
um a a one pager on uh sumary EBT I also
 
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
included the elderly simplified
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that I think is a
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
bit confusing is that there are um
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
several Federal programs that um provide
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
options for schools and community- based
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
programs to feed kids in the summer uh
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
and summary BT is a new federal
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
program um it's a much more direct way
 
00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:45.799 align:start position:0%
of ensuring that children who are um
 
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
under 185% of poverty can access meals
 
00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:51.559 align:start position:0%
in the summer it's
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
$40 per child per month in the summer
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
months so it's $120 per child per summer
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
and it comes to the family on an EBT
 
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
card just like snap that can only be
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
used to buy
 
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
food so that's um that's how summer EBT
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
works there are some some some schools
 
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
offer programs in the summer um for
 
00:21:21.549 --> 00:21:21.559 align:start position:0%
families to be able to send their
 
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
children to programs and they would get
 
00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh meals while they're there those are
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
um and those are great where they are
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
but they're not everywhere um there
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
really um are lots of gaps across the
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
state and many times families can't get
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
their children to this the place where
 
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
the where the meals are being provided
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
so it's just a much more direct way of
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
making sure that children are not hungry
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
in the summer children who during the
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
year eat free and reduce meals um would
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
would get additional dollars on the EBT
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
card so that they would not be hungry
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
the summer and just to be clear on the
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
cost um I I will defer of course to uh
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
my colleague at DHS but I believe they
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
testified that most of the cost is a
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
one-time cost um just under uh $900,000
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
or one-time cost for the electronic
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
changes that need to be made in their
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
system um and the ongoing cost is is
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
much lower um under $300,000 a year and
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
just the benefits for children for
 
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
families are 100% Federal so this would
 
00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:42.919 align:start position:0%
be bringing quite a lot of federal
 
00:22:45.149 --> 00:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
dollars into the state and I've provided
 
00:22:45.159 --> 00:22:45.990 align:start position:0%
dollars into the state and I've provided
some

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
estimates um on the sheet that I handed
 
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.310 align:start position:0%
estimates um on the sheet that I handed
out

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
so representative Lon uh thank you madam
 
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for that information
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
um so the summer food food service
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
program with the USDA is what we have in
 
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
my town if a family was had that would
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
they also then get these additional EBT
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
benefits where they're getting federally
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
funded meals in one location and then
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
also getting these additional EBT
 
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
dollars they could they could um they
 
00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
could get both it's I mean and just to
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
be clear it's $40 per child per
 
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
month um the EBT so um I don't you know
 
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:40.360 align:start position:0%
money representative wer so family at
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
this income level is also qualified for
 
00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:45.039 align:start position:0%
food stamps are they
 
00:23:49.149 --> 00:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
not uh yes that's right and doesn't the
 
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
food stamp provide for each
 
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
child well um food
 
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
stamps the average payment for food
 
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
stamps for a meal doesn't cover the
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
average cost of an actual meal in any
 
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
County in New Hampshire I'm I'm happy to
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
provide you with those data but um while
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
snap is incredibly helpful to families
 
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
it's generally not enough to meet their
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
needs most families run out of of uh
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
SNAP benefits you know by the second or
 
00:24:23.789 --> 00:24:23.799 align:start position:0%
third week of the
 
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
month so it's incredibly helpful to
 
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
families to be able to have their
 
00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
children eat breakfast and lunch at
 
00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:32.919 align:start position:0%
school during the year and during the
 
00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
summer the federal government has
 
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
created this new program to ensure that
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
they can access food in the summer as
 
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
well it seems like we're duplicating all
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
this Administration when an increase in
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
one would have taken care of it rather
 
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
than having two or three other programs
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
because the town will have a program
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
snap will have a program food stamps has
 
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.590 align:start position:0%
snap will have a program food stamps has
a

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
program it just seemed to if you
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
increased one place then it would all be
 
00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
centralized and we wouldn't have so much
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
money of the program spent on
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
Administration I would love to see
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
families have one program that met all
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
their needs that would be lovely but
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately those are the funding
 
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
streams are what they are so the federal
 
00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:15.799 align:start position:0%
government has has uh provided these
 
00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
funding streams and um to my mind it
 
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense not to use them to to
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
feed hungry kids um it's a lot of
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that would be brought
 
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
into the state uh about 4 and a half
 
00:25:32.389 --> 00:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
million the return on investment is just
 
00:25:34.269 --> 00:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
like snap it's invested in the local
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
economy so it stimulates the local
 
00:25:39.389 --> 00:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
economies um and
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
if this bill doesn't pass uh the
 
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
department has testified that they're
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to participate in
 
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
the program for this year and also for
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
next year um so you know those are
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that will be left on the
 
00:25:56.909 --> 00:25:56.919 align:start position:0%
table okay we're going to go
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative tersi then priest then
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
hle thank you madam chair thank you Miss
 
00:26:04.269 --> 00:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
Milligan for being here and helping us
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
break some of this down can you just
 
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
clarify that I'm reading this correctly
 
00:26:12.909 --> 00:26:12.919 align:start position:0%
that your data shows there are
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
37,325 children living in poverty that
 
00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
would qualify for this that potentially
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
don't have enough money for food that
 
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:21.799 align:start position:0%
number is is from the Department of
 
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:23.480 align:start position:0%
Education that's how many children are
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
currently enrolled in free and reduced
 
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
meals so that's who would be eligible
 
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
for this for for the summer program
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr uh Miss chairman and
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here um my first
 
00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
question was addressed um by your
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
response about the 37,000 children that
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
would qualify for the summer EBT do you
 
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
also have a number of the elderly and
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities in which this
 
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
program in its original state would
 
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
benefit so the the elderly simplified
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
application project um would uh make it
 
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
easier for older adults and people with
 
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
disabilities who who have no earned
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
income who have fixed incomes um to
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
qualify for snap I don't have exact
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
numbers of how many people it would help
 
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
I have some estimates um which I've
 
00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
included um but I would say that
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
currently uh participation in snap by
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
older adults um in New Hampshire is
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
we're we're the third lowest in the
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
country for uh participation so
 
00:27:44.909 --> 00:27:44.919 align:start position:0%
um you know in thinking about this bill
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
that the sponsors really wanted to do
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
something that would encourage older
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
adults to be able to access the benefits
 
00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:56.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:00.519 align:start position:0%
for thank thank you um so we heard
 
00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:02.919 align:start position:0%
earlier from Mr Ripple that this is a
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
$1.6 million cost and I'm not sure I'm
 
00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
understanding how the federal government
 
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
is going to be putting in the 4.5
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
million monly or your estimated 4.5
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
million and then the state's going to
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
have to pick up some portion but the
 
00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
notes I see look like it's 50% of the
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
administrative cost and I just can't
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
reconcile those numbers so can you help
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
there um again I certainly would defer
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
to my colleagues at DHHS but I but I
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
would say that um that what they have
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
estimated for
 
00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
fy2 is
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
1.57 U million um and of those um
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
890,000 are one-time cost the ongoing
 
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
cost is for 20 26 is
 
00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:53.519 align:start position:0%
2595 and for 27 is
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
2655 um and that's that's for both
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
that's for the summer EBT and it
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
includes uh the eldely simplified
 
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
application project follow follow up do
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
we or Mr Ripple do we have updated
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
information on the financial side of
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
this in terms of estimated costs no and
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that's I don't believe
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
the numbers from HHS have changed um
 
00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.070 align:start position:0%
the numbers from HHS have changed um
okay

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
but but but that information is correct
 
00:29:22.669 --> 00:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
the one time the administrated costs are
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
funded 50/50 between the state and the
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
federal government okay um at a $1.1
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
million first year cost in about 200
 
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
somewhat thousand in subsequent years
 
00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:33.519 align:start position:0%
but then the benefits themselves are
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
funded no further
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
question okay anything further for miss
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
milikin anything
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
further all right thank you very much
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
very informative and I know you've spent
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of time and effort on this Bill
 
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Hall yes since
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing an amendment I'd
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
like to at least move the amendment for
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
the purpose of disc discussion of 2024
 
00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
165h which is representative Edward's
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
amendment to modifying the bill for the
 
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
purpose of least having a discussion
 
00:30:09.789 --> 00:30:09.799 align:start position:0%
about it now and is that seconded I will
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
second okay G have representative f as
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
the recorded second would you like to
 
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.200 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion representative hle
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
sure so I understand that there is
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
potentially a lot of money that the
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
federal government um might have
 
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
available and I emphasize the word might
 
00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:29.559 align:start position:0%
relative to this presentation by New
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hunger Solutions however the
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
federal government is very broke right
 
00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:36.039 align:start position:0%
now so counting on somebody who's very
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
broke to continue to write checks is is
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
a fraught Mission I do think we should
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
try and fix some of the things relative
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
to our elderly populations and make sure
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
that they can continue for a longer
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
period of time without having to
 
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
reenroll and that cost of the $37,000
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
likely will be something that could
 
00:30:57.549 --> 00:30:57.559 align:start position:0%
potentially be a savings to the state in
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
terms of administrative costs which
 
00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
means a higher percentage of the
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
benefits go to those we trying to help
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
and not to just covering overhead so
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
with that I'd like to move to the
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
amendment okay the motion is the
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
adoption of 1650 which was um described
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
and discussed earlier representative
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
Hall's motion any further discussion on
 
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
the motion of the adoption of the
 
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
amendment representative tarki thank you
 
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
very much Madam chair um I will not be
 
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
able to support the me Amendment for a
 
00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:26.919 align:start position:0%
number of reasons let me
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
start number one I am still entirely
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
confused as to the process of dividing
 
00:31:36.629 --> 00:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
up a bill um the way I'm interpreting
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
this regardless of what the intentions
 
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
are of division 2 and division three and
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
whatever conversations were had from
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
those two chairs this one little piece
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
of paper is going to completely throw
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
away the rest of the bill including the
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
parts that we were not um allowed to
 
00:31:54.909 --> 00:31:54.919 align:start position:0%
discuss so for that reason alone I
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
cannot um support the amendment
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
because I do believe there is important
 
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
valuable information that we have not
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
really dug into um it's the purview of
 
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
division 2
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
um second to that is I believe that the
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
new federal summer EBT program is
 
00:32:20.909 --> 00:32:20.919 align:start position:0%
something that would be valuable to
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
37,000 329 children in this state that
 
00:32:26.909 --> 00:32:26.919 align:start position:0%
don't have enough to eat at home for
 
00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:29.559 align:start position:0%
whatever reason if it's parents who are
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
underemployed if it's children who live
 
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
in unique family situations with
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
grandparents with guardians um these are
 
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
children that due to no fault of their
 
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
own do not have healthy food in their
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
kitchen cabinets and not enough of it
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
and I think that for this division to
 
00:32:52.509 --> 00:32:52.519 align:start position:0%
throw out an
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a relatively small
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
investment from the state state to
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
enable this opportunity to bring that
 
00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
extra benefit to families who are
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
struggling is is really unfortunate so I
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
will be voting against this amendment
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
with the hopes of um saving part of the
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
original bill and I hope my colleagues
 
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
me representative
 
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
priest I will also be voting against
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
this amendment I think Mike I'm sorry
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
um I will also be uh voting against this
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
amendment because the fact that it's
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
gutting the entire bill that's been
 
00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
coming over here from the Senate and I
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
live in an area the city of Manchester
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
and I see this all the time when I'm
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
doing walks in the neighborhood of the N
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
the amount of poverty um that's in
 
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester and when you consider that
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
almost 40% of the children in Manchester
 
00:34:00.629 --> 00:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
is in this group your heart kind of
 
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
breaks and the fact that um this is a
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
very low amount of money that we're
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
asking for from the state um to provide
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
healthy foods for the children to get
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
them through the summer months and um
 
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
and secondly I think 37,000 is is
 
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
nothing to even address the elderly and
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
the people with handicap uh and their
 
00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
food needs so with those two reasons I
 
00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:36.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
amendment representative hle thank you
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I agree that it's
 
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
important to feed these families my
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
church is over in Auburn we have a food
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
Ministry meets multiple times a week we
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
funnel hundreds of thousands of pounds
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
of food into the Manchester area every
 
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
week well every year not every week I
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
also understand that our national
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
government is broken in terms of debt to
 
00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
quote Albert Einstein compound interest
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
is the eth wonder of the world he who
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
understands it earns it he who doesn't
 
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
pays it we are at 37 and sorry $ 34.5
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
trillion in debt and by September we'll
 
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
be at 35 trillion we are at a point in
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
the fiscal world where we will run a
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
ground financially every time we say the
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
federal government funds something we're
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
counting on a check that we can't
 
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
guarantee and we have to be prudent
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
about this are we as a state willing to
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
write this check for the full amount of
 
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
this money because if you're making a
 
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
promise somebody has to write the check
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day and right now we
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
are far more solvent we New Hampshire
 
00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
than the federal
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
government a large portion of our
 
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
government of our state is funded by the
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
federal government but in in in general
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
principles we have a much better credit
 
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
rating we are much better in terms of
 
00:35:58.589 --> 00:35:58.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal sanity
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
are we about to agree to approving the
 
00:36:03.309 --> 00:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
entire funding of this because the
 
00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:04.599 align:start position:0%
federal government doesn't have it
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
this okay any further discussion
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham and we're on
 
00:36:16.829 --> 00:36:16.839 align:start position:0%
the motion of adoption amendment number
 
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
165h which would replace the entirety of
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 499 representative Stringham
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd like to ask my colleagues to
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
vote this down because uh on a process
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
basis as well as the other reasons
 
00:36:32.309 --> 00:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
that's discussed uh division 2 has not
 
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
uh met to discuss this I understand the
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
chair of division 2 has problems with
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
the thing with the items under the doe
 
00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
portion uh our working plan was that we
 
00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
were going to split into two groups come
 
00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:50.839 align:start position:0%
back together and then uh at that point
 
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
if the bill needed to be amended we
 
00:36:56.589 --> 00:36:56.599 align:start position:0%
would amend it uh as as uh either the
 
00:36:58.990 --> 00:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
two divisions together or perhaps the
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
entire finance committee uh to in
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
division three when we haven't uh
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
meaningfully discussed any of the doe
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
portion or the more significant portion
 
00:37:12.309 --> 00:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
really of this bill uh that there was a
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
lot of work done um
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh uh I I I think risks the entire
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
process of of doing what we can uh for
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
those who are food um uh food short here
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
in in the State uh with with a a
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
programs with a lot of work done on them
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
that may work out very very well for us
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
so um uh my suggestion on the on a more
 
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
productive P process is just discuss
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
these two elements uh that are in the
 
00:37:50.109 --> 00:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
HHS portion uh we can have an idea of
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
where we want to go it's obvious that uh
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
the extension to the three-year piece is
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
is uh unanimously supported and uh there
 
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:02.440 align:start position:0%
are um uh there are pros and cons on the
 
00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:04.839 align:start position:0%
other the EBT portion of the
 
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
bill we walk out of here with with a
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
Resolute idea of where where we want to
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
go and wait till we remet with uh
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
division 2 or uh should our chair decide
 
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
There's A Better Way perhaps a full
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
committee uh to meet to to go through
 
00:38:22.349 --> 00:38:22.359 align:start position:0%
after division 2 has met uh that we do
 
00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
at this point but to just
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
discard uh uh all those different
 
00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:31.079 align:start position:0%
sections of the do doe piece just
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
because some parts of it sounds like
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
it's messy and uh it might not be ready
 
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh should go to interim study or
 
00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
something like that and just discard it
 
00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
uh for the rest of this banum I think is
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
um uh shortsighted so I'm going to vote
 
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
against this amendment and recommend
 
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
that we just talk through and prepare uh
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
for the for the next session that the um
 
00:39:02.589 --> 00:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
you representative tki I would just like
 
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
to say one last
 
00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:10.839 align:start position:0%
thing from my colleagues on division
 
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
2 I'm pretty sure they have no idea that
 
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
this happened they do know that their
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
meeting was canceled today and I have a
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
real problem with the members of
 
00:39:22.829 --> 00:39:22.839 align:start position:0%
division of a division not being allowed
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
to have a say over a policy that's been
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
put to them and have someone else pull
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
the rug out from underneath them so to
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
not allow those members to even be here
 
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
be part of this discussion and to know
 
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
that it's happening is just wrong and
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
I'm really sort of embarrassed that this
 
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
is actually even happening right now
 
00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:49.630 align:start position:0%
is actually even happening right now
thank

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:49.640 align:start position:0%

1650 okay as a reminder we are making
 
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the Full House

finance committee that is our purpose
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
today uh at this point now we have a
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
motion of an amendment that's just
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
passed to replace the bill uh do we have
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
a recommendation motion at this point
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative H I move that we
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
recommend passage as amended to the
 
00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
finance committee second so that would
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
be an ought to pass an
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
otpa to the finance committee with the
 
00:41:47.309 --> 00:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
discussion represent tarki I'm just
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
going to say again for the record I am
 
00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
really unclear how we even got to this
 
00:41:57.309 --> 00:41:57.319 align:start position:0%
point I am uncomfortable with the way
 
00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
this has played out and um I will be
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
voting no I think it's shameful that we
 
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
are throwing the whole thing away and um
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
we did not actually have a proper
 
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
process to even get to this point please
 
00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:17.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
no representative Stringham yeah I just
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
if anybody uh here um uh can clarify
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
will division 2 be meeting between now
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
in the full finance committee meeting to
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
discuss their portion of this
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
know I don't know so I I intend to vote
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
no because I think the rest of the bill
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
need needs uh the kind of oversight that
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh that the hard work done in the Senate
 
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
entitles it to and the importance for
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
the um potential recipients of the
 
00:42:58.829 --> 00:42:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
representa priest thank you um Madame
 
00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
chairman I will also be voting no as to
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
the reasons that have been expressed by
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
my colleagues here about the process of
 
00:43:14.549 --> 00:43:14.559 align:start position:0%
how we have come to this point and the
 
00:43:17.069 --> 00:43:17.079 align:start position:0%
fact that we are gunning this entire
 
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that's been worked
 
00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:23.720 align:start position:0%
on carefully by the Senate and replacing
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
it with a
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
$30,000 allotment which doesn't really
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of the 100 approximate
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
100,000 people and
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
37,000 children that um are in this
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
poverty State and are needing SNAP
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
benefits and I just think it's inhumane
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's just my values but I
 
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
you okay representative hle are you I
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay this point the motion on the floor
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass with Amendment
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative hall for discussion yeah
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
um I understand and hear the argument
 
00:44:16.109 --> 00:44:16.119 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
inhumane do not feed people but you
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
cannot be generous with somebody else's
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
money there is a fundamental philosophy
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
difference being generous means taking
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
it out of your own
 
00:44:32.589 --> 00:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
account donating food helping with those
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
directly you cannot compel someone else
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
to be generous that's no longer
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
generous I hear your argument but what
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
we are doing is is requiring other
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to foot the bill when we do
 
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
this it is not about generosity at this
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
point generosity starts when it comes
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
out of your own biggy
 
00:44:54.119 --> 00:44:55.829 align:start position:0%
out of your own biggy
Bank

00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
Bank
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
okay we we cannot compel someone else to
 
00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:03.549 align:start position:0%
okay we we cannot compel someone else to
fund

00:45:03.549 --> 00:45:03.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
this okay representative Lon um thank
 
00:45:09.069 --> 00:45:09.079 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um I recognize that this
 
00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
first section is a division 2 issue
 
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:13.720 align:start position:0%
however we do need to recognize that
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
this whole part is about providing lunch
 
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
to be eaten during during instruction if
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
it's out it seems that way after the
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
Bell so is it eating it at a recess
 
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
period when would you eat the food
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
that's after the Bell um I guess maybe
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
we're getting into the weeds but I have
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
three young boys who cannot concentrate
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
while they are eating I'm just worried
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
about the consequences on the actual
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
instructional time but I guess I
 
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
probably went a field and this is why
 
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
that would be division
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
to representative
 
00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.030 align:start position:0%
to representative
tki

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
tki
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
it represent Stringham I was just going
 
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
to say that that part of the bill is
 
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat complicated and nuanced which
 
00:45:53.069 --> 00:45:53.079 align:start position:0%
is why division 2 is handling it um we
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
had a whole discussion last week on what
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
it means to have breakfast after the
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
bell and I don't think we going to get
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
into it now so I don't think it's worth
 
00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.549 align:start position:0%
into it now so I don't think it's worth
my

00:46:00.549 --> 00:46:00.559 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
time represent Stringham yeah I I I
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
think the fact that you brought up the
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
questions that you did based on the read
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
shows the reasons why division 2 needs
 
00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
to go through all the sections of that
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
bill I mean we theoretically could do it
 
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
we haven't been tasked with do it that's
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
not what we came in here to do today and
 
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
um um you know I I would hope that the
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
the homework that we laid out last week
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
would continue and I thank you for your
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
question to emphasize the importance of
 
00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:39.349 align:start position:0%
question to emphasize the importance of
doing

00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
that this point the motion is ought to
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%

by 56 May 16
 
00:47:59.950 --> 00:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
that's my reading
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
so a lot of good discussion naturally uh
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
we'll see if division two adds anything
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
to the conversation or any Amendment and
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
so forth with regards to the portion
 
00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:13.559 align:start position:0%
that uh was assigned to them but as for
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
division three it looks like we have a
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
position at that point or at this point
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%

kadia fox who has responded to them in
 
01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:03.880 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Kaa Fox I'm the
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
director of the division for Behavioral
 
01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
Health and thank you for having me this
 
01:01:46.029 --> 01:01:46.039 align:start position:0%
afternoon I do realize that um I got the
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
responses in writing which yay I got
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
them in writing however you just
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
received them and may have not had time
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
to go over them I do have hard copies if
 
01:01:58.349 --> 01:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
if anybody would like a hard
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
okay all right so the first question
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
that was asked was um there was some
 
01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
discussion about the language around
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
requiring us to prioritize veterans what
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
um I can share with you this afternoon
 
01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
is that the shelter system does a really
 
01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
good job in serving this particular
 
01:02:47.069 --> 01:02:47.079 align:start position:0%
population today so this language will
 
01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:49.240 align:start position:0%
reinforce that emphasis and
 
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
prioritization on Veterans and so as you
 
01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
can see in the response there are um
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
specific programs and areas that address
 
01:03:04.269 --> 01:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
the veterans and um those include
 
01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:07.480 align:start position:0%
specific Outreach and specialized
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
programs to address this population
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
along with the training that is
 
01:03:16.269 --> 01:03:16.279 align:start position:0%
necessary to assist and so we're well
 
01:03:20.109 --> 01:03:20.119 align:start position:0%
poised to be able to um Implement that
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
portion of the
 
01:03:26.589 --> 01:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
bill and we also as you can see we um
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
have our in our database we are able to
 
01:03:32.269 --> 01:03:32.279 align:start position:0%
provide the numbers that we're currently
 
01:03:35.269 --> 01:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
serving in our shelter system and so
 
01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
there have been 33 individuals who
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
identifi themselves as veterans who are
 
01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:45.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
Services the next question was um about
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
not legally present and how are we going
 
01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
to be able to implement that that is a
 
01:03:58.750 --> 01:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
very question and it is very difficult
 
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
um and as you heard from the shelter
 
01:04:04.829 --> 01:04:04.839 align:start position:0%
programs last week that there are many
 
01:04:08.349 --> 01:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
people who do not have identification so
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
we don't have necessarily the hard proof
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
weather there here legally or not
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
however we do not want that to be a
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
barrier for entry into shelter because
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
we do know um that shelter is um the
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
first line of defense in harm reduction
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
and uh Prevention Services for those
 
01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
individuals and so again um we know that
 
01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
there are shelters that work very
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
closely in their case managers work with
 
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
those individuals seeking shelter
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
services to get them connected to
 
01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:44.599 align:start position:0%
services and the first thing they need
 
01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
to do is help them obtain uh um some
 
01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
type of identification to apply for
 
01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:54.349 align:start position:0%
type of identification to apply for
those

01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
services and then and um chairman
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
Edwards had asked about some ideas
 
01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
around a house resolution that he would
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
like to put forth and so we know that
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
the Housing and Urban Development um our
 
01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
federal funer provides funding for a
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
variety of different programs however
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
they do not support our shelter system
 
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
so we would like um to see that as a
 
01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
possibility to have um Federal funding
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
for what seems to be an ongoing and
 
01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
potentially increasing issue as we
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
talked about last week with our um
 
01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:39.430 align:start position:0%
talked about last week with our um
housing

01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.349 --> 01:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
shortages and then there was a question
 
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
about the rate and how do we come to the
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
rates and so you can see the formula
 
01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
here we have beds times dollars times
 
01:05:51.549 --> 01:05:51.559 align:start position:0%
days of the year in the total funding
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
and frankly as we talked about when we
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
increase the funding from $8 to $20 we
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
back into the number of the um dollars
 
01:06:02.109 --> 01:06:02.119 align:start position:0%
that we have that are appropriated for
 
01:06:02.119 --> 01:06:03.309 align:start position:0%
that we have that are appropriated for
these

01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
services and with this bill again it
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
would increase it to
 
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
$27 um per DM or per
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
bed and those are my responses for what
 
01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
week okay thank you so
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
$27 would be the result result of
 
01:06:29.309 --> 01:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill but the last budget
 
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
brought us from $8 per bed to 20 yes
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
but um chairman wer has I'm sorry
 
01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
chairman Wier I had notes from before
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
that there's 950 beds across the state
 
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
but I don't have down how many separate
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
agencies that we keeping track of that
 
01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
provide these yes there are 13 agencies
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
that are we fund
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
um and that are contracted with us of
 
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
those the one of them is the New
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Coalition against Domestic and
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
Sexual Violence and they have 10
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
programs under them so you take that you
 
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
shelters thank you representative
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
Stringham I had one other question just
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
about the nature of the contracts with
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
the 13 a agencies before and I was
 
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
wondering if you have any any
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
clarification in particular whether the
 
01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
contract in general anticipates that the
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
state will pay uh the fair cost and that
 
01:07:38.589 --> 01:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
the amount is um kind of was done as an
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
estimate or exactly um you know what
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
what is the appropriate State portion of
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the bed costs of for this
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
program so I think if I understand your
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
question we typically do not um there is
 
01:08:00.269 --> 01:08:00.279 align:start position:0%
no provision that I'm aware of that
 
01:08:05.069 --> 01:08:05.079 align:start position:0%
requires us to um reimburse the shelter
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
programs for 100% of their costs and as
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
they talked about last week they have um
 
01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
other funding sources which is primarily
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
fundraising and through grants so um
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
beyond that uh the state of New
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is their primary source of
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
funding at 100% General funds because as
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
I said they're not eligible for the
 
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
federal funding um under um HUD I hope
 
01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
question um I guess I guess it I guess
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
it does I mean I know in some other
 
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
programs it uh I mean we never guarantee
 
01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
costs but sometimes the the rate that we
 
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
agree to pay is based on some kind of
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
predetermined understanding of of uh
 
01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
what is appropriate and we've seen
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
things that programs have turned out to
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
be so expensive they've been difficult
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
for us to continue with after they're in
 
01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
place for a while so you know I I I'm
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
just trying to Grapple with how do we
 
01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
decide you know $8 wasn't enough it
 
01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
looks like $20 is not enough um and you
 
01:09:20.669 --> 01:09:20.679 align:start position:0%
know what probably $45 is definitely
 
01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
enough which is the cost so um you know
 
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
it are we deciding on 27 because 2 and a
 
01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
half million is just as big a bite as we
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
think is appropriate for this or you
 
01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:36.199 align:start position:0%
know why are we at 27 so uh that's
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
that's why some of the questions about
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
the nature of the contract were were
 
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
asked and um I Now understand that's not
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
IR relevant not there's there's no more
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
value in in discussing that part of it
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh to help us with this decision so any
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
other add-ons to that at all um no just
 
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
that I think we're getting a pretty good
 
01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
deal and that we're very fortunate that
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
we have these shelter programs who are
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
still willing to put themselves forth
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
and provide these services and they as
 
01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:13.719 align:start position:0%
this was a competitive um procurement
 
01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
they were willing to come forth and so
 
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
um we're getting a deal and they're
 
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
willing to do it and they're um using
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
other sources of funding in addition to
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
what the state can provide and um I will
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
say though that um this does not grow
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
the number of beds and we believe that
 
01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
there's demand that we could um increase
 
01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
our capacity but we also want to
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
preserve what we have and ensure that
 
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
forward representative hle thank you mam
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
chair um so in the budget we went from
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
$8 to 20 which we've discussed in the
 
01:10:59.870 --> 01:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
midst of an off-budget year level I
 
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
guess I'm trying I understand that it
 
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
there was a recent RFP that went out and
 
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
you have that as data to use to to show
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
that the there's a huge Delta between
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
the actual cost per bed per night and
 
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
what we're reimbursing them at but in an
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
off year when we're having trouble in
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
terms of funding all the other programs
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
what pushes this one ahead of the pack
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that question I'm here
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
to respond to what was put forth to us
 
01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
this was not um something that we put
 
01:11:37.229 --> 01:11:37.239 align:start position:0%
forth or requested that it be sponsored
 
01:11:39.149 --> 01:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
so this came through the legislative
 
01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
process and the sponsors um not from the
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
Department follow up then is there any
 
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
reason why this couldn't be delayed um
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
up until next year's budget cycle to be
 
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
included at that
 
01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
point I think that that is a question
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
that you should answer um and is there
 
01:11:57.629 --> 01:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
any technical let me is there any
 
01:11:59.070 --> 01:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
technical reason why it couldn't be
 
01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
delayed it's a policy decision as
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
opposed to an implementation decision
 
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely so we can um if you gave us
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
$500 million we can implement it um but
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
I do understand that there are a lot of
 
01:12:14.189 --> 01:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
Demands that are on and pressures right
 
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
now um especially in an off-budget Year
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
and that we're um could be facing a
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
difficult budget session upcoming so
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
there' be no guarantee that the
 
01:12:27.149 --> 01:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
department would be able to embed this
 
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
in our budget and have it accepted as a
 
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.669 align:start position:0%
in our budget and have it accepted as a
prioritized

01:12:30.669 --> 01:12:30.679 align:start position:0%
prioritized
 
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
need followup follow up I think I heard
 
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
you say 500 million I think you meant
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
500,000 but please correct me I I was
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
just being factious over the top
 
01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
um yes okay the implementation mechanism
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
would remain the same whether it's $5 or
 
01:12:49.159 --> 01:12:50.790 align:start position:0%
would remain the same whether it's $5 or
2.5

01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
2.5
 
01:12:53.149 --> 01:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
million representative
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
priest thank you madam chairman for
 
01:12:58.870 --> 01:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
allowing me to uh to acknowledge me and
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and for your
 
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
recent letter um you mentioned in a
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
handout that New Hampshire has seen a
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
52% increase in homelessness from
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
2022 to
 
01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
2023 do you have any idea of what 2024
 
01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:20.990 align:start position:0%
2023 do you have any idea of what 2024
looks

01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
looks
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
like that is a very good question and
 
01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:26.679 align:start position:0%
very timely we have have a point in time
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
count that was taken in January and
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
those numbers are expected to be
 
01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:32.350 align:start position:0%
those numbers are expected to be
released

01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
released
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
momentarily um I I don't have those
 
01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
numbers and I and um so I would need uh
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
to go back and be able to provide that
 
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
if we have preliminary data um so I I'm
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
unable to answer that today but I think
 
01:13:49.870 --> 01:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
just from our experiences in what we're
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
seeing um for the demand for shelter and
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing in our cities
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
communities across the state um I think
 
01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
we're still there's a lot of need out
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
there as a followup please follow and
 
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that this is the largest
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
percentage in the entire country and
 
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
it's still growing and it's still a
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
major problem for all of the major
 
01:14:17.229 --> 01:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes I I understand there um
 
01:14:23.229 --> 01:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
the housing costs in the New England
 
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
region are extremely high and have
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
pushed a lot of people um
 
01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
into difficult
 
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
situations representative
 
01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
H you we've talked a lot in in division
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
3 and DHHS relative to matches between
 
01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
federal and
 
01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
state is there any similar or analogous
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
type situation where we do some sort of
 
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
Grant to these particular organizations
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
with some sort of explicit or impli
 
01:14:58.350 --> 01:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
match where they say for every $2 you
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
raise privately we'll fund you at a
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
dollar or whatever is is there any
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
policies like that in the department
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
ready so um I would need to defer to
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
someone else from a department-wide
 
01:15:15.149 --> 01:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
perspective um typically when we see
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
those matches as you indicated those are
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
at the federal level um and the states
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
Pro uh required to provide a match in
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
kind or in hard dollar
 
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
um in this particular case um these are
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
are organizations that are small um for
 
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
the most part and it would be extremely
 
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to be able to do that
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
so in this circumstance I would find it
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
um really really challenging and that we
 
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
would likely um see um them not to be
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
able to continue to provide the services
 
01:15:55.229 --> 01:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
but again um from a department wide
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
can't think of a situation where we
 
01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.229 align:start position:0%
can't think of a situation where we
require

01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you Miss Fox anything
 
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
further for her okay oh representative
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
priest yes I was wondering if you have
 
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
any estimates you mention that we're
 
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
just funding the 950 beds currently but
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take into account the
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
additional people the additional needs
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
of veterans and families that are
 
01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
needing this service do you have any
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
950 that is a great question that I
 
01:16:38.430 --> 01:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
don't have a response today that's
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
something I could come back with where
 
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
we do have um data from the shelter
 
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
programs over um how often they're full
 
01:16:52.629 --> 01:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
um and when um so from a capacity um
 
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
versus utilization you know we could
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
come back with that number to see where
 
01:16:59.709 --> 01:16:59.719 align:start position:0%
where the uh difference is and what the
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
real need would be if we were to expand
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
those and that might be something for
 
01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
session okay thank you very much Mr
 
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
White or others who are interested in
 
01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
chiming in on anything that's been said
 
01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
406 um one thing that does strike me is
 
01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that uh this increase was just
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
provided uh a year
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
ago and um and here we are looking for
 
01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
an increase to that so that's something
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
that should probably should be
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
considered as we go forward with a
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation to full finance
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative Hall yeah given that we
 
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
went from $8 to to 20 an increase by 12
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
and here A year later we're looking for
 
01:18:02.910 --> 01:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
another $7 increase or they about 60% of
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
that increase I would move in from study
 
01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
or itl on this at this point I think
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
this is a budget year item and it should
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
be taken up next
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
either representative Earth I'm willing
 
01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:26.629 --> 01:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
do we have a
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
coin I'll move itl okay the motion's
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
been made for it is there a second
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
second okay seconded by representative F
 
01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:35.790 align:start position:0%
second okay seconded by representative F
representative

01:18:35.790 --> 01:18:35.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
tersi oh do I get to speak
 
01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
first do is he GNA speak to his motion
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
or are we good on where it's
 
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
at go ahead
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
yeah that's weird that went off um I'm a
 
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
little disappointed to hear a motion of
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
itl um yeah the um amount was raised
 
01:18:58.350 --> 01:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
last budget cycle however I think we
 
01:19:00.629 --> 01:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony that the need is real
 
01:19:05.310 --> 01:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
the need is um extreme and we have these
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
different agencies that are um busting
 
01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
at the seams um families
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
veterans um men and
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
women and although it is an off budget
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
year I think that um the way this bill
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
is drafted very simply to give these um
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
agencies that increased assistance at
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
this time would
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
be very needed and that next year when
 
01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:35.239 align:start position:0%
we come back and and write the budget
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll be able to um figure out
 
01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
a way to um match that and give them the
 
01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
funding that they actually need to
 
01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
continue those services so I'd be voting
 
01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
itl representative wer followed by
 
01:19:52.629 --> 01:19:52.639 align:start position:0%
representative PRI we haven't even had a
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
year to judge how much help the $20
 
01:19:58.750 --> 01:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
increase has been over what I wrote down
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
was a $7 I think we went from 7 to 20
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
you had eight had eight anybody else
 
01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:06.870 align:start position:0%
you had eight had eight anybody else
have

01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
eight I had uh eight starting and now at
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
20 okay but we don't even know the
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
effects of that over the previous what
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
has been a year since the budget passed
 
01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
or less than a year and plus I think
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
we're being a little bit in this Bill
 
01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
telling them what we think they should
 
01:20:29.229 --> 01:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
have for priorities when there's so many
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
different ones each one has their own
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
priority each one is organized a little
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
differently and I'm just grateful
 
01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
they're doing this and they're raising
 
01:20:39.149 --> 01:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
the money to do this I don't think we
 
01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
should step in like a bully and say
 
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
we'll tell you what to do when we're not
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
even providing half and uh as was
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
pointed earlier a lot of them don't have
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
identification so we're going to say you
 
01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
have to prove that you're citizen you
 
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
have have to prove that you're a veteran
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
and you know and I know the veterans are
 
01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
doing their best to to do special
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
programs for the veterans so I don't
 
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
think I think it's untimely to be
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
putting all this in now and we don't
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you Madame chairman um I will
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
be voting against this itl being a
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
resident of the city of Manchester I
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
have seen personally how the homeless
 
01:21:32.110 --> 01:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
crisis has been expanding and increasing
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
every year and I see the number of
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
people on the streets in the Parks
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
sleeping and being without beds and
 
01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
being without services and being without
 
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
facilities and it's getting
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
worse and um this is just a Penance to
 
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
what we can do right now to the exist in
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
agencies that are providing services to
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
these people and therefore I will be
 
01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
itl representative
 
01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
Stringham yeah I I appreciate the
 
01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
testimony we've heard um you know while
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
we're we're not uh required to uh
 
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
partially fund or fund these at any any
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
level it is an essential service um that
 
01:22:27.629 --> 01:22:27.639 align:start position:0%
we need to live in a civil society uh
 
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
there's uh many programs that we support
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
that we gave um significant uh increases
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
to uh with this budget this being one of
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
them uh we heard a considerable amount
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
of testimony that even at these levels
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh that the um uh many of these centers
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
are having a difficulty uh maintaining
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
staff or paying them appropriately or uh
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
and their their skilled labor is making
 
01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
less than and the the local rate at at
 
01:22:59.709 --> 01:22:59.719 align:start position:0%
fast food stores and uh there's real
 
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
concern that uh that will be dealing
 
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
with with a problem with uh this this
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
particular uh uh need of our
 
01:23:13.709 --> 01:23:13.719 align:start position:0%
vulnerable uh where where we probably
 
01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
need to increase beds we might see
 
01:23:18.750 --> 01:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
decrease beds without uh this
 
01:23:23.310 --> 01:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
increase uh so um I I intend to support
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
it based on the test Tony uh that we
 
01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
heard I do know many of these facilities
 
01:23:31.629 --> 01:23:31.639 align:start position:0%
I mean I saw an ad for uh families in
 
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
transition thanking all the money they
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
received for people who ran in the
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
Boston Marathon I think that's great I
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
don't think that that um uh obviates the
 
01:23:45.870 --> 01:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the impact that a $2.5 million
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation uh that we make uh could
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
have on top of that so I'm going to go I
 
01:23:54.669 --> 01:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
would support support this bill uh that
 
01:23:57.709 --> 01:23:57.719 align:start position:0%
came out of the Senate uh unanimously
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Hall thank you
 
01:24:05.550 --> 01:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
um again there are some real needs we've
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
seen the devastating effects of an an
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
economy where inflation is significant
 
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
cost of food and housing has gone
 
01:24:18.189 --> 01:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
through the roof those of limited means
 
01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
took it on the chin because those are
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
two of the biggest categories that's
 
01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
that young families in particular and
 
01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:24.950 align:start position:0%
that young families in particular and
elderly

01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
elderly
 
01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:27.400 align:start position:0%
are the ones as a percentage of their
 
01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
overall budget that's the area that got
 
01:24:30.990 --> 01:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
hit the hardest and unfortunately we
 
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
don't capture some of that information
 
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
CPI I do think that trying to do this in
 
01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
an off-budget year is the wrong place
 
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
and time um we should in fact plan for
 
01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.350 align:start position:0%
and time um we should in fact plan for
this

01:24:44.350 --> 01:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:24:48.990 --> 01:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
this we we just increased this by $12
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
over over the prior one uh a rather
 
01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
significant 150% increase over over the
 
01:24:56.910 --> 01:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
the prior amount and now we're back
 
01:25:00.109 --> 01:25:00.119 align:start position:0%
again asking for another 60% increase in
 
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
this in this category that's a
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
significant amount I if we had passed
 
01:25:10.510 --> 01:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
the house bill 1560 we'd have more funds
 
01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
in the general fund to work with but we
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
left a significant amount of money in
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund and that will
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
limit our ability to do things in the
 
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
general fund going forward I'm not sure
 
01:25:24.189 --> 01:25:24.199 align:start position:0%
who voted there was no roll call votes
 
01:25:25.950 --> 01:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
on on that bill but I do know that
 
01:25:27.629 --> 01:25:27.639 align:start position:0%
that's going to handicap what we can do
 
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
this year and um this might be the small
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
price we have to pay to not have the
 
01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
fund okay thank you all for the uh
 
01:25:41.550 --> 01:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
discussion I will be supporting
 
01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:45.719 align:start position:0%
supporting the motion of itl I I too
 
01:25:50.910 --> 01:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
agree that a jump from $ eight to 20 in
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
just a year's time uh is not enough time
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh additionally I received a phone call
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
from a rather prominent citizen on this
 
01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:03.719 align:start position:0%
bill uh supportive and we spoke and one
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
thing I did mention is that this summer
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
of course the Departments are already
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
putting together their budgets for next
 
01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
year it doesn't take long before the
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
next thing you know drafters are at
 
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
their desk working and uh it's something
 
01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
certainly that DHHS should take a look
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
at for next year when the draft proposal
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
of a budget is introduced with that I'm
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
going to ask the clerk to call the role
 
01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
ready the bill is uh H uh SB 406 the
 
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:42.560 align:start position:0%

representative Priest
 
01:27:03.870 --> 01:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
No representative or chair chairwoman
 
01:27:08.109 --> 01:27:08.119 align:start position:0%
Mooney yes uh the vote being 5 to3 uh
 
01:27:10.510 --> 01:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
the recommendation to the full committee
 
01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:12.229 align:start position:0%
the recommendation to the full committee
is

01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:27:17.310 --> 01:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
itl okay moving now to work session on
 
01:27:19.629 --> 01:27:19.639 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
311 and that's an act relative to
 
01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:24.280 align:start position:0%
property tax offset for the town of
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
Hampstead and making an appropriation
 
01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
therefore this bill by means of some
 
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
background was uh approved by Senate
 
01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
Finance 7 to Zer adopted by the full
 
01:27:39.149 --> 01:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
Senate on a Voice
 
01:27:41.229 --> 01:27:41.239 align:start position:0%
vote uh with that I'll open it to
 
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
discussion I don't think we have any
 
01:27:44.669 --> 01:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
additional information uh other than
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
what was discussed at last week's work
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
session representative Wier I did uh
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
talk to uh
 
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner um da
 
01:27:56.629 --> 01:27:56.639 align:start position:0%
Charlie Arling housee and I said you
 
01:27:59.430 --> 01:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
were quoted as saying that the state
 
01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
never made any payments
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
for property
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
tax uh to any any town and I said I
 
01:28:12.990 --> 01:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
think you're wrong I recall the uh
 
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes uh Dam things where
 
01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
they had flood planes that were
 
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
um affecting six different towns and
 
01:28:26.910 --> 01:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
they promised the towns that if you'd
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
forbid any development in the flood
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
Plaines because the do dams are going to
 
01:28:33.109 --> 01:28:33.119 align:start position:0%
put up to save Massachusetts from
 
01:28:38.109 --> 01:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
flooding we will pay you the um losses
 
01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the property tax that you would have
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
had and I recall that distinctly because
 
01:28:44.910 --> 01:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
it it was something that the new
 
01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
attorney general had to sue the state of
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
Mass they were supposed to also chip in
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
and pay these property tax losses to
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
those six towns and uh they finally did
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime uh New Hampshire was
 
01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
paying both the the share by the state
 
01:29:01.629 --> 01:29:01.639 align:start position:0%
by the state of New Hampshire and the
 
01:29:04.109 --> 01:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts so I think those
 
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:06.280 align:start position:0%
are still ongoing and Charlie said well
 
01:29:07.870 --> 01:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
I didn't know that I'll look it up and
 
01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
he's hasn't got back to me yet but to
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
say that this has never happened before
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
I think is wrong because that was a
 
01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
perfect example of what it was in your
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
know loss of property
 
01:29:23.109 --> 01:29:23.119 align:start position:0%
tax uh was made up by the state and the
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts so I'm in favor
 
01:29:29.070 --> 01:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
of this and and uh and I think that
 
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
there were there were several years that
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
it was done and not only that but some
 
01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:36.280 align:start position:0%
of the people in Hampstead say you know
 
01:29:38.109 --> 01:29:38.119 align:start position:0%
we never would have allowed this in our
 
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
town we would have made problems and
 
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:43.400 align:start position:0%
made made a big fuss if we weren't at
 
01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
least going to get paid back for the
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
property tax law so uh I think we owe it
 
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
to the the people that made the deal
 
01:29:53.550 --> 01:29:53.560 align:start position:0%
initially and that chose Hampstead and
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor favor of of paying this
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.149 --> 01:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
you representative priest yes the I
 
01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
would be in in favor of s SP 311 but the
 
01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
question that I have is this a one-time
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
payment or is this going to be
 
01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:15.400 align:start position:0%
continuing every year it wasn't clear
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
that I could find thank you thank you
 
01:30:20.590 --> 01:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
and I would like to call a Mr White up
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
too I do have a question myself perhaps
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
that one we can sort of stock these up
 
01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
so you can answer them all together uh
 
01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:28.510 align:start position:0%
so you can answer them all together uh
representative

01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.310 align:start position:0%
representative
tarki

01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
tarki
 
01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:33.400 align:start position:0%
okay so my question was sort of related
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
to representative
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
pri's at the last work session I
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
recalled two payments have been made
 
01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
already to Hamstead so at some point
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
when you answer my question
 
01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
representative priest say could you
 
01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:47.719 align:start position:0%
address just how those came to be thank
 
01:30:50.189 --> 01:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
you sure um good afternoon members of
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
the committee Nathan white CFO of
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:30:57.109 --> 01:30:57.119 align:start position:0%
the way that the language is crafted
 
01:30:59.590 --> 01:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
within this bill here this would be a
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
one-time payment for State fiscal year
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
2025 which was consistent with the
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
intent of the Senate um the department
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
has made two prior payments um via the
 
01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
governor and executive Council they
 
01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
weren't technically contracts they were
 
01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
unencumbered payment requests in the
 
01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
amounts of approximately 176,000
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
$177,000 in change
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
um the reason why we made those payments
 
01:31:30.430 --> 01:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
is um as representative wer had
 
01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
indicated there were many conversations
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
going on during the time um in the fall
 
01:31:40.510 --> 01:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
of 2021 and the spring of uh 2022 prior
 
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
to the the June 8th 2022 acquisition of
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
Hamstead Hospital whereby the the the
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
state was agreeing to make those
 
01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
payments um to offset the the impact to
 
01:31:59.709 --> 01:31:59.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
town is it too premature to ask if this
 
01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:07.400 align:start position:0%
will be a permanent fixture in the
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
that I I I think that's one of the
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
questions that that this committee is is
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
here addressing today it's it's I mean
 
01:32:22.229 --> 01:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
ultimately whether the state intends to
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
continue to make payment to the town in
 
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
perpetuity is really I mean it's a
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
pretty significant policy decision um
 
01:32:30.590 --> 01:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
the state has done so with the city of
 
01:32:33.629 --> 01:32:33.639 align:start position:0%
conquer recognizing the loss of parking
 
01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
um Revenue that they they lose on an
 
01:32:41.229 --> 01:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you I recall from the
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
testimony last week uh the town of
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
Hamstead has had to hire two police
 
01:32:53.310 --> 01:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
officers uh because of calls and so
 
01:32:57.149 --> 01:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
forth that have occurred as a result of
 
01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
um the state hospital now located there
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
so um I guess you're right making this a
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
permanent fixture would take a lot of
 
01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
discussion in terms of uh what exactly
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
that money year-to year would be
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
expended on but as was mentioned that's
 
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
not really the issue before us what's
 
01:33:18.750 --> 01:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
before us is approximately
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
$191,000 to cover their costs and offset
 
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
uh significant Personnel changes the
 
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
town has had to make to help the state
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
out any further questions for Mr
 
01:33:34.990 --> 01:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
White okay with that I'll entertain a
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
motion on Senate Bill 311 representative
 
01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
Stringham yes I'll make a motion of a to
 
01:33:43.709 --> 01:33:43.719 align:start position:0%
pass is there a
 
01:33:47.229 --> 01:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
second representative f for a second any
 
01:33:49.149 --> 01:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
discussion starting with representative
 
01:33:49.159 --> 01:33:50.870 align:start position:0%
discussion starting with representative
Stringham

01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
Stringham
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
um while I do agree with with others the
 
01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
issues of whether to make a permanent
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
pilot as part of State policy is a
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
bigger discussion uh I think we should
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
be very comfortable making this
 
01:34:06.030 --> 01:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
onetime uh onetime appropriation for the
 
01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
town of Hampstead uh that's in a very
 
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
critical position as we uh reorganize
 
01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
and and um some of our youth detention
 
01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
programs and this uh you know the
 
01:34:20.189 --> 01:34:20.199 align:start position:0%
importance of the facility that they
 
01:34:23.669 --> 01:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
have uh so uh I think the approp
 
01:34:25.149 --> 01:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
Corporation is
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable um both for us and for the
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
town and therefore uh I put forward the
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
motion of a to
 
01:34:39.070 --> 01:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
you I'll be honest I have some problems
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
with the precedent that this
 
01:34:50.510 --> 01:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
sets not because they don't deserve the
 
01:34:54.629 --> 01:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
tax payment um I'd like like to know
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
that moving forward if the state is in
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
this position of acquiring acquiring
 
01:35:03.229 --> 01:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
property that this discussion would be
 
01:35:05.310 --> 01:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
part of a deal it seems like in
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard lots of conversations
 
01:35:10.229 --> 01:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
happened lots of promises were made
 
01:35:11.790 --> 01:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
public hearings maybe things were
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
discussed but no one produced a written
 
01:35:17.950 --> 01:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
agreement that the state would be
 
01:35:21.629 --> 01:35:21.639 align:start position:0%
responsible for ongoing tax payments I
 
01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
understand that's the situation we're in
 
01:35:27.149 --> 01:35:27.159 align:start position:0%
I think it's sort of unfortunate I think
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
it was messy and someone dropped the
 
01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
ball um I do wish to Echo my friend over
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
there it's not a budget year they could
 
01:35:40.590 --> 01:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
have come in you know we could have um
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
maybe seen it I believe the testimony
 
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
was the Senate took it out I don't
 
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
back refresh my memory to clarify um
 
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
during the Senate phase Senate Finance
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
voted to add it on on an oral vote uh
 
01:36:00.990 --> 01:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
Voice vote to to to add money into into
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
the budget for this year and the
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
department um for the first state fiscal
 
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
year 24 the department went through and
 
01:36:10.270 --> 01:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
went ahead and took General funds to try
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
to be reflective of that and then we had
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
conversations with Senator berdel
 
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
requesting that a bill be brought
 
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
forward to be consistent with that vote
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
so that we had legislative authorization
 
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
to move forward with that consistent
 
01:36:26.109 --> 01:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
with what was voted on okay so again
 
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
conversations that were had as opposed
 
01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
to actually having it um you know a
 
01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
concrete deal at the beginning having it
 
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
in the budget as a regular ongoing
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
expense um I think it's unfair to the
 
01:36:43.229 --> 01:36:43.239 align:start position:0%
town to keep them in this limbo knowing
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
that next year we're going to have to
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
come back and fight this battle again
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
um I will be supporting the motion with
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
reservations as to how this played out
 
01:36:59.070 --> 01:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
and the precedent it sets moving forward
 
01:37:03.070 --> 01:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
known I too will support ought to pass
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
one detail that has not come up in this
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
conversation is that this 100 acres in
 
01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
Hampstead now owned by the state will be
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
the future home of the Youth Detention
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
Center yes I'm sure there'll be much
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
more on this to
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
come representative Hull thank you madam
 
01:37:26.350 --> 01:37:26.360 align:start position:0%
chair um we can't fix the past
 
01:37:29.550 --> 01:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and I fully agree with my
 
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
member across the the way that this
 
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
should have been addressed in whatever
 
01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
contractual negotiations that happened I
 
01:37:38.189 --> 01:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
do think we could amend this to make it
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
clear that the legislative intent is
 
01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
this not to go forward because my
 
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
biggest concern is not the hund and
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
whatever thousand doll for the current
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
hospital it's when we build the sununu
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
center for another $21 million and now
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
this this annual payment has blossomed
 
01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
from 100
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
70,000 to 350,000 or something I'm going
 
01:38:00.669 --> 01:38:00.679 align:start position:0%
to be voting no if there was an
 
01:38:02.589 --> 01:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
amendment that made it really clear that
 
01:38:05.870 --> 01:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
this was to address a one-time issue
 
01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
relative to what happened during the
 
01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
budget cycle and that this is not to be
 
01:38:14.830 --> 01:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%

01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
today Mr
 
01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
Ripple I have nothing thank you
 
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
representative lki thank you very much I
 
01:39:27.149 --> 01:39:27.159 align:start position:0%
just want
 
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
to have a moment of privilege here to
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
say that what happened with Senate Bill
 
01:39:39.109 --> 01:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
499 earlier um really distresses me
 
01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:41.159 align:start position:0%
there are lots of questions about
 
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
process that I feel um were not handled
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
properly I would really like to go back
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
and look at the tape of the first public
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
hearing and when we decided we were
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
going to divide that bill after maybe it
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
was maybe it happened after the first uh
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
work session I can't remember but I
 
01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
believe that we were presented with a
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
plan for that bill that we all came here
 
01:40:11.070 --> 01:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
today expecting well some of us
 
01:40:13.149 --> 01:40:13.159 align:start position:0%
apparently came here expecting a plan
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
today and it was completely upended
 
01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
there were members my colleague I didn't
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
realize represent Mari on division 2 was
 
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
here she knows nothing nothing about the
 
01:40:26.709 --> 01:40:26.719 align:start position:0%
plan for that bill in division 2 I feel
 
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
like that was dishonest it was a posted
 
01:40:34.030 --> 01:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
meeting today that was then half of it
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
was pulled down without any explanation
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
and I would just like to publicly
 
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
express my disappointment of that how
 
01:40:43.629 --> 01:40:43.639 align:start position:0%
that whole matter played out thank you
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
very much for giving me a
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:51.719 align:start position:0%
noted all
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
right with that uh we will end our work
 
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
session today there is no doubt I will
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
say no doubt we are taking on very heavy
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
sensitive issues hunger homelessness
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
nobody takes these lightly our job is to
 
01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:09.320 align:start position:0%
uh diligently work as members of house
 
01:41:12.270 --> 01:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
finance and an off- budget year and uh
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
review each bill uh to the best of our
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
abilities with that I'm going to close
 
01:41:19.629 --> 01:41:19.639 align:start position:0%
the work sessions scheduled for today
