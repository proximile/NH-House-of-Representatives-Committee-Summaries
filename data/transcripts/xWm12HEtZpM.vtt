00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:03.159 align:start position:0%
ual intended filing uh the bill seeks
 
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
the repeal of three sections that
 
00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
currently authorize the unwarranted
 
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
seizure of firearms without any
 
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
semblance of due process under existing
 
00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519 align:start position:0%
statue 173 B4 temporary relief the law
 
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
permits the issuance of temporary or
 
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
emergency protective orders based on
 
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
nothing but a v vague allegation of
 
00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse or
 
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
stalking in New Hampshire and elsewhere
 
00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 align:start position:0%
these temporary restraining orders are
 
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 align:start position:0%
nearly always granted by judges even
 
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
when the petitioner does not even allege
 
00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 align:start position:0%
any abuse or stalking the petitioner
 
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
simply ask the judge to approve the
 
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 align:start position:0%
temporary order these orders are then
 
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
executed without the defendant's
 
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge as a matter of routine police
 
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
officers generally seize all firearms
 
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 align:start position:0%
ammunitions and other weapons from the
 
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
subject of the
 
00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
order the sections we propose to
 
00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
eliminate are those that empower the
 
00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 align:start position:0%
confiscation of firearms ammunition and
 
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
deadly weapons by a police officer based
 
00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 align:start position:0%
solely on these temporary orders such
 
00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 align:start position:0%
mandates Gravely infringe on
 
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
individual's fundamental rights without
 
00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
the requisite due process or evidentiary
 
00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 align:start position:0%
support we are challenging the notion
 
00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
that mere allegations sometimes with
 
00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
zero evidence should be sufficed to
 
00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 align:start position:0%
strip an in individual of their
 
00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights and personal
 
00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 align:start position:0%
property the low threshold for issuing
 
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
such orders is dangerously akin to Red
 
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
Flag gun laws which have been a subject
 
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
of intense debate and legal scrutiny
 
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
notably the case of the United States
 
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
first uh rahami is currently pending
 
00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
before the United States Supreme Court
 
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
after a decision from the fifth circuit
 
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
invalidating federal law prohibiting
 
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
individuals from possessing firearms
 
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
while under a restraining order casting
 
00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 align:start position:0%
doubt on the constitutionality of
 
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
prohibiting IND individuals from
 
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
possessing fire Firearms while under
 
00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 align:start position:0%
restraining order this case underscores
 
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
the pressing need to re-evaluate and
 
00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 align:start position:0%
reform our approach to such sensitive
 
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
and impactful legal
 
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 align:start position:0%
instruments our objective is not to
 
00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
diminish the gravity of domestic abuse
 
00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
or the importance of protective orders
 
00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
however we firmly believe that the
 
00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
process of depriving individuals of
 
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 align:start position:0%
their natural and constit ially
 
00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 align:start position:0%
protected rights must be approached with
 
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
the utmost rigor and respect for due
 
00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
process the current mechanism which
 
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
allows for this uh precipitous and
 
00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
unchecked removal of one's right to bear
 
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
arms un unified unverified assertions is
 
00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 align:start position:0%
a glaring up front to the principles of
 
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
Justice we hold dear often times uh
 
00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 align:start position:0%
after the execution of uh these
 
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
temporary orders the subject of the
 
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
order will retaliate and get a
 
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
protective order on the uh the original
 
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
accuser and then that uh person will
 
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
lose their rights to bear arms as well
 
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh when they're in a situation where
 
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
they may uh be some sort of abuse in
 
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
essence this bill fortified by its
 
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
accompany Amendment uh represents a step
 
00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 align:start position:0%
towards safeguarding the constitutional
 
00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 align:start position:0%
rights of our citizens while ensuring
 
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
that any actions to protect the
 
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 align:start position:0%
individual from harm are judicious
 
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
evidence-based and firmly rooted in the
 
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
principles of due process I urge you to
 
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
consider the profound implications of
 
00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 align:start position:0%
current law and join me in supporting
 
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
this essential reform
 
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh and with that I will take any
 
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 align:start position:0%

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 align:start position:0%
fifth circuit the fifth circuit has
 
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
already invalidated the law and the
 
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 align:start position:0%

Martin good morning Mr chair members of
 
00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Pamela kyg and
 
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
I'm the public policy specialist at the
 
00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Coalition against Domestic
 
00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 align:start position:0%
and Sexual Violence and I'm joined here
 
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 align:start position:0%
today with my colleague Jessica who's an
 
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
executive director from one of our
 
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
member programs and we're here to
 
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
represent our network of crisis centers
 
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
um as you know the Coalition is the
 
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
umbrella Organization for the state's 12
 
00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 align:start position:0%
community- based crisis centers that
 
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
serve more than 14,000 survivors of
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual Violence each year
 
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
um and that also includes victims of
 
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
human trafficking stalking and child
 
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
abuse um and I'm here today emphatically
 
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
oppose HB 1064 which is incredibly
 
00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 align:start position:0%
dangerous legislation that would keep
 
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
deadly weapons in the hands of abusers
 
00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um and I would also be
 
00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 align:start position:0%
opposed to the proposed amendment that
 
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
was just brought forward now um and just
 
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
to quickly answer the question the FIS
 
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
circuit rahimi case has already had the
 
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
oral AR arguments in front of the
 
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court um so just kind of to
 
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
quickly overview just how dangerous this
 
00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 align:start position:0%
legislation is more than half of all
 
00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
domestic violence homicides in New
 
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are the direct result of
 
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
abusers um so that means that most of
 
00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 align:start position:0%
these homicides involve a firearm or
 
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
deadly weapon um and offenders are
 
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
responsible like I said for the majority
 
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
of these homicides in our state so the
 
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
question that I would really like to ask
 
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
the committee this morning is why are we
 
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
even debating a bill that would keep
 
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
deadly weapons and firearms in the hands
 
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
of abusers this bill seeks to repeal a
 
00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
crucial provision that currently exists
 
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire's domestic violence
 
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
statute RSA
 
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
173b if this Bill were to pass police
 
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
would no longer seize an abuser's uh
 
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
weapons after an arrest for violating a
 
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
protective order even if the abuser used
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
the weapon to abuse or threaten their
 
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
victim this is outrageous especially
 
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
when we know that an abuser's access to
 
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
a firearm increases the risk of domestic
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
violence homicide
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
fivefold um when an abuser violates a
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
protective order this is a signal to
 
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
their community that they are
 
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable completely disregarding a
 
00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
court order and that they are completely
 
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
breaking the rules um and the laws of
 
00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 align:start position:0%
the state um and I think what's really
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
important to understand is that when a
 
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
domestic violence protective order is
 
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
granted a judge has already found by
 
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence that an
 
00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
abuser is an imminent and credible
 
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
threat to the victim's safety
 
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
um current law takes the crime of
 
00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759 align:start position:0%
domestic violence seriously and
 
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
recognizes that when an abuser knowingly
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
violates a protective order they pose a
 
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
significant risk and threat to the
 
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
victim in the public failur to remove
 
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
firearms and deadly weapons from the
 
00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
hands of abusers will only lead to more
 
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases more injuries
 
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
and deaths that are 100% preventable
 
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
under current law um abusers must be
 
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
held accountable for the violence
 
00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 align:start position:0%
committed against their Partners family
 
00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
members and children in recent weeks
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
communities across New Hampshire have
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
been reeling in the wake of several
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
horrific domestic violence homicides
 
00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
passing this bill would send a clear
 
00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:57.639 align:start position:0%
message to communities mourning their uh
 
00:06:59.869 --> 00:06:59.879 align:start position:0%
these tragic losses that me members of
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature aren't
 
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
invested in the safety of their citizens
 
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
um just to kind of wrap up um we have an
 
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make our communities
 
00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
safer and instead we are here this
 
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
morning fighting against outrageous
 
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
legislation that is trying to turn back
 
00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:15.639 align:start position:0%
the clock to the
 
00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:18.039 align:start position:0%
1970s a time when systems of
 
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
accountability for domestic violence
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
offenders were simply non-existent with
 
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
so many pressing issues facing victims
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
and survivors in New Hampshire it's
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
inexcusable that this bill is even Up
 
00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
For Debate in 2024
 
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
uh long ago the state
 
00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
legislature sorry recognized the
 
00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:36.759 align:start position:0%
seriousness of domestic violence in our
 
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
communities and this bill is an open
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
invitation for future violence and has
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
no place in our state um I would also
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
just like to note that stalking and
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
domestic violence can be co-occurring
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
and when stalking is present in a
 
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
domestic violence uh situation the
 
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
victim is three times more likely to be
 
00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
murdered by their abuser um I would like
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
good morning uh chair and members of the
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Jessica Von Martin
 
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:09.080 align:start position:0%
and I am the executive director of The
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
Crisis Center of Central New Hampshire
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
um our agency is the Domestic and Sexual
 
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
Violence agency serving marac County uh
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
our office is right here in conquer and
 
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
each year we serve between 1200 and 1500
 
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
unique survivors of violence that
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
includes people of all genders ages and
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
orientations as the leader of that agent
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
and an advocate against for domestic
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
violence survivors for almost 25 years I
 
00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
am here today to express my strong
 
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill as you can
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
imagine our team supports survivors in
 
00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:43.399 align:start position:0%
their lowest moments we placed 49
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
individuals into emergency shelter this
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
year last year helped 11 families flee
 
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
the state due to safety concerns and
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
supported the filing of more than 140
 
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
domestic violence protective orders in
 
00:08:58.069 --> 00:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
2023 our staff and volunteers he daily
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
the stories of violence that people face
 
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
and the fear in their voices protective
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
orders are one of the few ways survivors
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
can create protection around themselves
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
and their families and this bill as
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
written would effectively remove those
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
protections and increase the likelihood
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
of injury and death in our state to
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
domestic violence for example a recent
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
example a woman we were supporting to
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
get a protective order which was not
 
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
granted on the first time around I will
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
add was living in a basement and would
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
not leave her house until she received
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
confirmation that all weapons had been
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
confed ated by local law enforcement the
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
perpetrator had multiple guns which he
 
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
had held to her head several times
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
before she
 
00:09:39.389 --> 00:09:39.399 align:start position:0%
left she was so fearful of being found
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
she stayed hiding in that basement for
 
00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
more than 3 weeks refusing to leave for
 
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
food work or anything in this instance a
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
tragic outcome was avoided but what
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
could have happened if he was able to
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
hold on to his weapons if perpetrators
 
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
are allowed to keep their guns after
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
that kind of behavior these are the
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
lengths survivors will need to go to
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
keep themselves and their family safe we
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
already know as Pamela said that many
 
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
homicides in New Hampshire are related
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
to domestic violence therefore I asking
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
this committee to oppose this bill so we
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
are not adding to those numbers thank
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
you for your time and consideration of
 
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
this bill and the work you do to keep
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
safe I'm happy to field any questions
 
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.350 align:start position:0%
safe I'm happy to field any questions
representative

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I have a question we in the
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
previous testimony we heard that these
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
orders are based on
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
allegations and we also heard that um
 
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
there's no due process and a lot of
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
times we hear that these guns are
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
confiscated do you have any comments on
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
on those uh those allegations sure I
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
will share with you that although we
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
supported 140 domestic violence
 
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
petitions in Marram County last year
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
many many many were not granted and so
 
00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
there is an there is a matter of due
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
process and there does need to be
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
compelling evidence of an eminent threat
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
yeah um only about about a third of
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
final protective orders are granted in
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
the state the process to receive a
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
protective order is extremely stringent
 
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
and has a high bar like I mentioned
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
there needs to be clear and convincing
 
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
evidence of a credible present threat to
 
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
the victim's safety um and that includes
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
173b if you could um a second could you
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
tell us um about how long the period is
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
from the original order to the hearing
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
order so from the temporary protective
 
00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:36.519 align:start position:0%
order to the final hearing usually it
 
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
needs to happen within 30 days and
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
typically is within that time frame so
 
00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
normally Firearms are seized on the
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
temporary order and held at least until
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
the final order hearing is held at that
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
time is it your understanding that if
 
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
the order is not granted the Firearms
 
00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.870 align:start position:0%
the order is not granted the Firearms
are

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:11:59.069 --> 00:11:59.079 align:start position:0%
returned yes but the uh the temporary
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
restraining order has the same uh
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
credible present threat standard so it's
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
not like there's the same standard it's
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
the same criteria except for one is X
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
parte the the defendant isn't present at
 
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
the temporary order correct that's
 
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
usually done yeah and I know that there
 
00:12:16.829 --> 00:12:16.839 align:start position:0%
are some folks behind me that can better
 
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
answer some of those uh legal questions
 
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Newman your
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up question oh okay um further qu
 
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative sing thank you for taking
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
my question um I'm curious of the
 
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
domestic violence homicides that occur
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um what percentage of
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
those are um does the perpetrator use um
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
what we would consider a deadly weap
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
weapon firearm or ammunition it's about
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
50% it fluctuates every um couple of
 
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
years but it pretty stays pretty evenly
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
axelman hello thank you very much so um
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
my basic understanding is there was
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
miscommunication with the sponsor NOS
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
the intention was to strike not that
 
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
part a different part
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
um there are a few different parts
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
different sections of RSA
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
173 the uh primary statute that
 
00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:39.399 align:start position:0%
authorizes the restraining orders which
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
function as red flag laws um one of the
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
parts directs law enforcement to take
 
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
possession of all firearms ammunition
 
00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
and weapons initially when the order is
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
served and that's an emergency order
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
temporary order and then um then we go
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
from there to the final order another
 
00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
section of RSA 173
 
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
says if a person violates the order um
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
continues to abuse the person with the
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
protection order and they're arrested
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
then police can do certain things
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
including cease Firearms which is
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
redundant um my my understanding as a
 
00:14:15.629 --> 00:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
sponsor did not even mean to strike that
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
part that's fairly reasonable if you're
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
arrested for violating it um it's the
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
initial serving of the order um to to
 
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
correct some of the the previous uh
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
testimony the big thing that there's
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
disagreement on is uh due process but
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
also how easy it is to get the orders I
 
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
have some evidence in in the folder here
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
I'll share with the committee and we can
 
00:14:38.749 --> 00:14:38.759 align:start position:0%
make copies um that prove with you know
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
the judge's signature that these uh
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
emergency orders and temporary orders
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
are granted with I think someone said an
 
00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:47.759 align:start position:0%
extremely high bar I would say an
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
extremely low bar but actually
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
non-existent so if you look at RSA 173
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
which is the statute that creates the
 
00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:56.519 align:start position:0%
restraining order and RSA 633 stalking
 
00:14:58.749 --> 00:14:58.759 align:start position:0%
kind of points to that statute for the
 
00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
uh criteria so really 173 is the primary
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
statute it says there should be a threat
 
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
there should be you know some evidence
 
00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
or uh an allegation saying hey that
 
00:15:09.629 --> 00:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
person uh either stalked me or did
 
00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
domestic violence there have been cases
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
which you know I have uh proof evidence
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
of with the judge of signature where a
 
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
person did not even make an allegation
 
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
just said I want an order I didn't make
 
00:15:21.749 --> 00:15:21.759 align:start position:0%
an allegation said I want to be
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
protected from this person and the judge
 
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
approved it and then um police went to
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
the person's home seized about um a lot
 
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
of uh Firearms amunition from that
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
person and relatives and other firearms
 
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
that were in that property and that
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
person is now out um a substantial
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
amount of their net worth and um that's
 
00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
a taking as far as eminent domain scotus
 
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
case law says that's obviously taken by
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
a long shot they took the property um as
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
far as getting it back there's another
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
bill that representative Manion put in
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
um to give it back but you don't get it
 
00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
back right away so the at the final
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
hearing um previous PE testimony was
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
correct that the final hearing there
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
should be a higher bar to and that's for
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
a year so within 30 days you get a
 
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
chance to go to court and have some due
 
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
process and then the judge is supposed
 
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
to uh have a higher bar to approve the
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
order for a year and then if it's not
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
approved the order is uh dissolved but
 
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
then to get your Firearms back you have
 
00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:19.959 align:start position:0%
to go again to a different judge get a
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
lawyer go to a judge ask for a court
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
order to compel the police to give your
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
guns back and then you can go to the
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
police station and then um generally you
 
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
have to pass a next background check
 
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
you'll have to prove that all the
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
firearms and amunition is yours based on
 
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:36.839 align:start position:0%
serial numbers uh registration receipts
 
00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
and all that stuff and according to RSA
 
00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:41.959 align:start position:0%
173 I believe according to the state law
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire police can charge you fees
 
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
for every day and I've heard of some
 
00:16:48.189 --> 00:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
exorbitant uh stories of of the fees
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
amounting to to ridiculous numbers for
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
for doing the privilege of holding your
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
property for you and it says they could
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
damage your firearms and ammunition and
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
lose and lose them with impunity so
 
00:16:59.550 --> 00:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
that's interesting too um so people are
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
losing value and again what this allw
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
comes down to is is very simple is a lot
 
00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:06.039 align:start position:0%
of people said you know they are abusers
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
we have to protect victims from abusers
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
there's a reason do process exists um if
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
some people think the founders were
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
brainless for writing the Fifth
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment I would disagree there's a
 
00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
reason the Fifth Amendment is there
 
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
there's a reason we have courts it's to
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
adjudicate guilt if we're going to
 
00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:23.079 align:start position:0%
presume people guilty based on one
 
00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
person's extremely low bar um allegation
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
or in some cases no allegation Justus
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
request for an order which can ruin a
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
person's life for a lot of reasons um
 
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
that order there's a reason you judicate
 
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
them as guilty so others today have said
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
all others elsewhere I've heard say do
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
you want people who have guns and beat
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
their wives and stalk people and use
 
00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
guns and shoot their wives to have guns
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
and have freedom and never be punished
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
no like someone mentioned a person put a
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
gun to their wife's head absolutely that
 
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
person should be very swiftly arrested
 
00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
prosecuted convicted it could all happen
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
within a day uh you know two days 3 days
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
and then put in prison for however long
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
the sentence is um but if we're going to
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
skip that and punish them arrest them
 
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
take their firearms punish them um
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
convict them essentially then why do we
 
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
have courts so what I would propose is
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
getting rid of Courts we could save
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money we all love that get rid
 
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
of Courts when police go to a home
 
00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:18.039 align:start position:0%
they'll declare the person guilty throw
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
them in jail or prison and um it'll be
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
more efficient why have courts so I
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
would ask any opponent to the bill why
 
00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
do we have courts is to adjudicate guilt
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
there's a reason we have due process
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
there's a reason the founder said we
 
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
have presumption of
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
innocence we're supposed to be presumed
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
innocent and and I think everyone of
 
00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
this committee understands that if
 
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
someone commits an act and and we've
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
seen you know the Boston Marathon
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
bombers people um committing 911
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
terrorism like murder and Broad day
 
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
light still they're Presumed Innocent
 
00:18:50.149 --> 00:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
you can't even call them a criminal you
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
have to say alleged criminal otherwise
 
00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
they Su for defamation right you can't
 
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
even call them convicted um so some
 
00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:56.919 align:start position:0%
would even say the statute calling them
 
00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
a victim is like saying the person is a
 
00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:00.919 align:start position:0%
convict that's they should be alleged
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
victim alleged uh criminal alleged
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
abuser CU there's been zero de process
 
00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
um something else that that maybe we'll
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
get to in another bill or an amendment
 
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
or a later year is there are remote
 
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
hearings so the the emergency and
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
temporary order granted by a judge um
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
telephonically a a cop calls a judge in
 
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
2 second signature um and then it's
 
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
approved and the cops take the firearms
 
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
and stuff um they say you know we can't
 
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:27.799 align:start position:0%
waste any time we can't waste a second
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
the person we have to take their guns
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
they're dangerous and forget do process
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have time for that um we have
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
video and I know this because in New
 
00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:36.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire courts and all over in federal
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
courts they have remote testimony so why
 
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't an amendment to this bill or a
 
00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:42.919 align:start position:0%
new bill why couldn't the judge when he
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%

them and at least ask if they would like
 
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
a remote hearing to defend themselves um
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
and you know they can appear Maybe via
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
remote hearing and defend themselves and
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%

out a restraining order on me I never
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
laid a hand on her um and uh you know
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
she had no no reason to uh 5 days later
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
I was uh allowed to have a hearing they
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%

know they they gave me a hearing and my
 
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
lawyer walked up to her and uh at the
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
time there was a perjury statement on
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the restraining order that
 
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:13.720 align:start position:0%

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
up and said look we can prove you you've
 
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
lied we'll press perjury charges if you
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
don't resend this right away she did
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
okay you know proof that these
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
restraining orders are used as a weapon
 
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
okay um a few years later there was a a
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
hurricane forecast and stuff and uh I
 
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
had uh been helping this uh this Vietnam
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
vet and uh he was he he had some mental
 
00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
problems and he had a Jeep with a rag
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
top on it and he came by my house and he
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
said can you help me put the rag top on
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
and uh you know before the hurricane so
 
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
you know we did and uh when the
 
00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
hurricane came it blew the rag top off
 
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
and uh he came to me and you know he was
 
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
serious as a heart attack he said you
 
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
owe me
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
$800 so I laughed at him you know and
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
that you know he got all kinds of mad
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
and he went to to the Der district court
 
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
and convinced the judge that uh that on
 
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
the restraining order it said that I was
 
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
looking to take over the country I owned
 
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
uh many guns I was a bodybuilder I get
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
head but anyway um you know um you know
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
it it was a lie once again he went down
 
00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:18.919 align:start position:0%
to the clerk's office to get the
 
00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039 align:start position:0%
paperwork after the the hearing and
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
and he looked at one of them he knew he
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee my
 
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
name is Steven Andis I'm an assistant
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
County attorney in the maram county
 
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
attorney's office with me is attorney
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
Halverson who is the Marat County
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
attorney both of us have been
 
00:27:47.789 --> 00:27:47.799 align:start position:0%
prosecutors um for a little over 20
 
00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:49.269 align:start position:0%
prosecutors um for a little over 20
years

00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
each listening
 
00:27:54.669 --> 00:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
to uh we oppose this bill uh listening
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
to what's been said it seems like
 
00:27:59.509 --> 00:27:59.519 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of focus on on the abuser
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
instead of the
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
victim um I hear people talking about
 
00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights and the founders
 
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
and and their their their thoughts I
 
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
would I'd remind the committee that part
 
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
one article three of the New Hampshire
 
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution indicates when men enter
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
into society they surrender up some of
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
their natural rights to that Society in
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
order to ensure the protection of others
 
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
and certainly uh Society has an
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
obligation to protect people
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
and in this case Society has an
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
obligation to protect
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
victims it there is a balance between
 
00:28:37.389 --> 00:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
protecting victims and victim's rights
 
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
to be safe and an abuser's right or a
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
person's right to to keep in be arms
 
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
certainly 173 B4 seems to
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
recognize um those competing interests
 
00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:51.559 align:start position:0%
and sets forth a
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
framework there there is due process in
 
00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:57.919 align:start position:0%
173 B4 to have your Firearms seized
 
00:29:00.669 --> 00:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
by um law
 
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement for a temporary order there
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
needs to be a showing of immediate and
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
present danger of abuse that's someone
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
has to go in front of a judge a judge
 
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
has to make that finding and then the
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
judge issues a temporary restraining
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
order that temporary restraining order
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
may it doesn't require but it may direct
 
00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:23.240 align:start position:0%
the uh defendant to relinquish firearms
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
and deadly
 
00:29:26.909 --> 00:29:26.919 align:start position:0%
weapons most temporary restraining
 
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
orders in my experience have included
 
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
that provision because that provision
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
certainly makes sense if somebody is uh
 
00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:36.919 align:start position:0%
an immediate and present danger of abuse
 
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
then it makes sense that a court would
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
ask that they relinquish their firearms
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that that's a
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
relinquishment of firearms it's not a
 
00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:47.799 align:start position:0%
surrender of firearms the the defendant
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
still owns those firearms and as we've
 
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
talked about there is a process to get
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
those back which is also outlined in 175
 
00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.669 align:start position:0%
those back which is also outlined in 175
173

00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
173
 
00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:01.519 align:start position:0%
B5 and in addition to the process to get
 
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
them back within 173 B5 if you don't
 
00:30:06.669 --> 00:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
want the police department storing your
 
00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:08.519 align:start position:0%
Firearms you can file a motion and have
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
your Firearms transferred to a federally
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
licensed Firearms dealer you can sell
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
those guns you can keep those guns you
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
can transfer them to another person you
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
can do all of that while this temporary
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
order is pending against
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
you in terms of how long the temporary
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
order is is valid for I would note that
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
currently in 173 B4 if an exp parte
 
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
temporary order issues the defendant the
 
00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:37.519 align:start position:0%
person against whom that order was
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
issued can request a hearing and a
 
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
hearing shall be held within three but
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
no later than five business days so this
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
is not an extended relinquishment of
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
firearms this is you get a hearing
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
within 3 to 5
 
00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
days at that hearing the the the
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
permanent order under 173 B5
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a showing of abuse by
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
a preponderance of the evidence the
 
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
defendant is given notice of that
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
hearing and has a right to be present at
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
that hearing and has a right to present
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
their own testimony at that hearing if
 
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
the court makes that finding of abuse
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
then the court shall order
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
relinquishment of firearms which is
 
00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
law looking at the original bill I was
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
confused because it certainly didn't
 
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
change the relinquishment of firearms in
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
temporary or permanent restraining
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
orders I understand there's an amendment
 
00:31:36.509 --> 00:31:36.519 align:start position:0%
the amendment that I'm looking at at
 
00:31:36.519 --> 00:31:37.269 align:start position:0%
the amendment that I'm looking at at
least

00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
least
 
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
today um still deals with 173 B4 which
 
00:31:44.509 --> 00:31:44.519 align:start position:0%
is the temporary orders but still
 
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't address 173 B5 which would be
 
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
permanent restraining ORD so under a
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
permanent restraining order there would
 
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
still be a relinquishment of
 
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
firearms but certainly there is a
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
balance in the statute and the stat
 
00:31:59.909 --> 00:31:59.919 align:start position:0%
statute seems to recognize that not sure
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
if you had anything to add not to that
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
so far that's all I've got that's all I
 
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
got yeah I do have a couple
 
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
things I don't you want to ask attorney
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
ERS questions before thank thank you
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
morning chairman Roy morning committee
 
00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:14.919 align:start position:0%
members um I'm not going to add uh
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
repeat what attorney endes covered uh I
 
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
think he outlined the statute fairly
 
00:32:21.389 --> 00:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
well I do want to comment on a couple
 
00:32:23.789 --> 00:32:23.799 align:start position:0%
things uh that was testified to earlier
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
and some of the questions that the
 
00:32:27.789 --> 00:32:27.799 align:start position:0%
committee had um the case versus RI
 
00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
about the Rami case out of the fifth cir
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh fifth Circuit Court I actually spent
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
a couple hours last night reading
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
through the riyami case oral arguments
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
were last fall uh and I looked through
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
um there were about 40 or so amicus
 
00:32:43.629 --> 00:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
briefs filed in Rami I've looked through
 
00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
a number of them looked through the
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
facts of the original case involving Mr
 
00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
Rami and I just want to com comment
 
00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:52.039 align:start position:0%
about what happened to Mr rami's case
 
00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
because I think it's important Mr Rami
 
00:32:57.389 --> 00:32:57.399 align:start position:0%

after due process for a period of two
 
00:33:24.629 --> 00:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
years and I'm reading out of one of the
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:30.760 align:start position:0%

00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
future the court accordly prohibited
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%

00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
owning a firearm um uh but he went on to
 
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:00.440 align:start position:0%
later violate that uh he participated in
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
a series of five shootings in December
 
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
of 2020 and January
 
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
2021 uh after someone who had bought
 
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
drugs from him started talking trash is
 
00:34:10.589 --> 00:34:10.599 align:start position:0%
the quote on social media he went to the
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
man's home and fired bullets into it
 
00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:14.599 align:start position:0%
using a rifle the next day uh after
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
colliding with another vehicle he got
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
out of his car shot at the other driver
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
and fled 3 days later he uh fired a
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
firearm in a residential neighborhood uh
 
00:34:26.669 --> 00:34:26.679 align:start position:0%
without striking anybody luckily uh
 
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
couple coule weeks after that a truck
 
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
flashed his headlights at Mr Rami on the
 
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
inter on on a roadway during when he was
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
passed Mr Rami chased that truck down
 
00:34:38.589 --> 00:34:38.599 align:start position:0%
misidentified another vehicle and fired
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
into that vehicle well that's what
 
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
brought Mr Rami uh before the um before
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
the federal court for possession of a
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
firearm in violation of 18 USC 922 uh if
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
anyone deserve to be in front of the
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
court it appears from the from the
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
summary of the record that it it's
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
probably Mr rihani um the question comes
 
00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
then and I Circle back to what attorney
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
Andress said is is the focus here on the
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
Violator or the alleged
 
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
violator or the safety of the individual
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
and um I agree that uh that at times uh
 
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
with enough due process that we need to
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
protect the victims in in these cases
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's clear I spoke with many of
 
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
the County attorneys either directly or
 
00:35:28.589 --> 00:35:28.599 align:start position:0%
by email and everyone I talk to is
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill I'm sure they would
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
be opposed to the bill in the amended
 
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
format uh I understand from talking with
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
virtually uh all the Chiefs by email or
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
by uh telephone uh in marama County all
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
of them are opposed to this bill I'm
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
sure they would oppose it in its amended
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
form um I believe the association Chiefs
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
of police may also be in opposition to
 
00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
this bill and I think they file written
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
written documents
 
00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
um it's it's worthy to note to attorney
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
andw touched on on this surrender or
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
confiscation big difference uh it's my
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
understanding even under federal law a
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
person can have an ownership interest
 
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
but may not be able to possess a firearm
 
00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
um that's addressed within 173 regarding
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
the return of firearms even in 173 B9
 
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
when it talks about a violation of a
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
protective order in paragraph um Roman
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
one subparagraph B it talks about uh the
 
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency shall maintain
 
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:31.480 align:start position:0%

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
order direct that the Firearms
 
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
ammunition or other deadly weapons be
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
relinquished and specify to whom the
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
person uh or U uh the Firearms will be
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
relinquished to the court in 2023
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
updated their their protocols on just
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
this very issue chapter 14 of their
 
00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:51.079 align:start position:0%
protocols within the court spells out um
 
00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
the due process requirements of
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
returning Firearms how they're returned
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
to whom they're returned the hearings
 
00:36:58.990 --> 00:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
that are required and as part of their
 
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
statutory references they go through the
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution part one
 
00:37:06.309 --> 00:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
article 2A they talk about RSA um
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%

173b uh violation of protective orders
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
under B9 173 B9 uh and they go on to uh
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
uh address that so there is due process
 
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the application procedure the
 
00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:28.359 align:start position:0%

consideration but one comment in that
 
00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
that I'll end with talks about the
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
relinquishment of firearms and in that
 
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
article the author mentions roughly half
 
00:38:37.309 --> 00:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
of states have addressed a gap talking
 
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
about a surrender Gap in federal law at
 
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
the time
 
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
um by including specific state
 
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
requirements for surrender of firearms
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
upon imposition of permanent restraining
 
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
orders uh and it talks about that within
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
the article I commend that article to
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
you for for your reading and review for
 
00:38:56.309 --> 00:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
statistics and um and overview about the
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh about the reason and need for
 
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
these types of statutes uh I'll gladly
 
00:39:06.309 --> 00:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
answer any questions uh and uh have any
 
00:39:06.319 --> 00:39:07.109 align:start position:0%
answer any questions uh and uh have any
the

00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
only the only thing I would add is in
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
reference to the returning of firearms I
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
know both attorney Halverson and I have
 
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
handled those hearings on behalf of the
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
state so we're happy to answer questions
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
about that as well certainly thank you
 
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
that's actually my first
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
question is it the current state of the
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
law that if a permanent order is granted
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
that someone is required to go for a
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
separate proceeding to get their
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
firearms back and why is that versus
 
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
just simply saying the ORD is not
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
granted here are your Firearms back why
 
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
is the why is the the alleged uh
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
perpetrator required to go through a
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
separate legal
 
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
proceeding 173
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
B5 uh section
 
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
10c says law enforcement agencies shall
 
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
not release firearms and ammunition and
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
specified deadly weapons without a court
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
order granting such release so the
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
statute requires the police to have a
 
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
court order to Grant a
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
release I guess my question is why when
 
00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
the judge says I'm not going to Grant
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
this permanent order and hereby order
 
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
the return of the Firearms why is there
 
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
a second it's an expense to the to the
 
00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
person to have to go get an I mean other
 
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
than the fact that we wrote the law
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
right I mean that's what the law says I
 
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the background of that
 
00:40:29.069 --> 00:40:29.079 align:start position:0%
particular sentence in the statute is
 
00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
nor do
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
I it just seems to me if the it would
 
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
only make sense that if the the judge
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't find reasonable grounds to issue
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
the the person should just have their
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
property back without having to an
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
expense of another hearing yeah there's
 
00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
some there's some interesting statutes
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
because it also talks about when police
 
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
acquire property through any means that
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
they have to hold it as the court
 
00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:56.839 align:start position:0%
directs um so we've certainly had
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
you know controversies over how long
 
00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
does something have to be in the police
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
possession before we need a court order
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
to return it um also to the best of your
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge is there any uh requirement
 
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
that a receipt an itemized receipt be
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
given by law enforcement to someone when
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
they seize their property I don't
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
believe there's a requirement for an
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
itemized receipt all of the Departments
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
that I've ever worked with are very um a
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
afraid I think of being accused of
 
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
damaging property or losing property so
 
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
it's the type of thing where if they if
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
you have money in your pocket they're
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
going to count it in front of you twice
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
and have you sign that that's what the
 
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
money is so all the Departments I've
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
worked with have always kept an
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
inventory of exactly what's taken um
 
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
I've always seen itemized lists of
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what's taken as have I I I just
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
simply have concerns if I had to prove
 
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
that I own something that they took up
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
from me um and go back can find receipts
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
from something I bought 15 years ago
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
we'd be in problems I I've never had
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
any I shouldn't say I've never had any
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
issue of ownership because I I actually
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
have a case now where a third party is
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
claiming that it was their gun that was
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
seized and they want it returned to them
 
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
instead of the the defendant there's a
 
00:42:19.309 --> 00:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
presumption that property seized from a
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
person is owned by that person
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
right and if multiple people live in one
 
00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
dwelling all the firearms in the
 
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
dwelling are seized and then it's up to
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
the individuals to go and kind of prove
 
00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
that was mine and not theirs and then
 
00:42:34.349 --> 00:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
they can't bring it back to the dwelling
 
00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
how how does that
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
work I don't believe all the firearms in
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
the dwelling would be seized it's the
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
firearms that are owned or under the
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
control of the person who the protective
 
00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:51.559 align:start position:0%
order has been issued against um if
 
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
those Firearms were able to be accessed
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
by that person potten potentially they
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
could be seized but I would assume that
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh you could restrict access within the
 
00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
dwelling um representative rhods thank
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh my first question was
 
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
going to be about an
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
itemized inventory if you will so with
 
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
that question already being answered
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
could you perhaps walk us
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
through like say this you know the
 
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
person is is the clear and convincing
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
evidence has been found and going to go
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
into this home and or place of residence
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
and they're going to seize this property
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
could you walk us through what that
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
process is or how they go about saying
 
00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:37.880 align:start position:0%
you know is there things in this closet
 
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
or they under the bed or I I've never
 
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
been personally involved in that process
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
um my understanding from reading the
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
statute and from talking to police
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
officers over the years is that they
 
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
would say to First they're going to have
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
a conversation with the victim and say
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
does this person have any firearms and
 
00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
then they're going to have a
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
conversation with the defendant and say
 
00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
do you have any Firearms um if so this
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
order requires you to relinquish them to
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
us we've certainly had cases where
 
00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
defendants say nope I don't have any
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
Firearms the police don't then search
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
the house they're not ransacking it
 
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
looking for firearms because the statute
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't authorize them to do it it
 
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
authorizes them to essentially receive
 
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
from the defendant those firearms and
 
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
the court orders the defendant to give
 
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
them over having said that if the victim
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
says yeah he's got a gun he has a
 
00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
handgun in the nightstand handgun in the
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
nightstand handgun in the nightstand and
 
00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
the defendant says nope no handgun in
 
00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
the nightst I have always told the
 
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
police what you need to do is obtain a
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
search warrant um because you have
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe he's violating
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
the protective order if you have
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe there's a
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
firearm in the nightstand so depending
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
on what you're being told um you would
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
then get a second warrant which would
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
authorize you to search the residents um
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
for firearms and that's address in 173
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
B5 Roman 2 uh the defendant should be
 
00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
prohibited from purchasing receiving or
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
possessing any deadly weapons and any
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
Firearms or ammunition for the duration
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
of the order the court May subsequently
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
issue a search warrant authorizing a a
 
00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:10.559 align:start position:0%
police officer to seize any deadly
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
weapons specified in the protective
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
order and any and all firearms and
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
ammunition if there is probable cause to
 
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
believe that firearms and ammunition are
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
kept under the privilege of presidence
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
or curtilage of the defendant so they
 
00:45:23.069 --> 00:45:23.079 align:start position:0%
have to go through another due process
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you aware of a
 
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
provision where a nixus or background
 
00:45:38.829 --> 00:45:38.839 align:start position:0%
check is required by the police even
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
though there's a court order from a
 
00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:42.200 align:start position:0%
judge saying to relinquish those
 
00:45:44.109 --> 00:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
Firearms when the person shows up at the
 
00:45:45.549 --> 00:45:45.559 align:start position:0%
police station are they now required to
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
go through a criminal background check
 
00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
as well before the police release the uh
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
guns or
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
ammunition I'm not aware of a
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
requirement for that um I know that I in
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
my experience there have been individual
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
police departments who will want to run
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
the record a second time um but I don't
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
know that that's required I think the
 
00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:08.839 align:start position:0%
courts and I I can't put my finger on I
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
think the courts may run on domestic
 
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
violence cases do a next check but that
 
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
was if I'm not mistaken was that
 
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
challenged yeah my understanding is that
 
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:21.559 align:start position:0%
if the motion to return Firearms if the
 
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
motion return weapons is firearms that
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
gets sent to the state police who do um
 
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
a NYX check if it's non firearm deadly
 
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
weapons like if we seized a crossbow or
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
that type of thing then it goes to the
 
00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:38.559 align:start position:0%
local police department to run a a
 
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
right representative
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you and thank you for
 
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question um we often hear that
 
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
expar hearings are unconstitutional and
 
00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
they don't provide due
 
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
process um um do you have any comments
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
on that why it is and I've also read
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
that that that it is a waiver to doe
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
process as opposed as providing due
 
00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:08.079 align:start position:0%
process in temporary temporary instances
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
where there's a government uh need for
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
that so could you just comment on that
 
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
and kind of help us straighten that out
 
00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
and what supports that as
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional I'm I don't know of
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily a constitutional provision
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
that specifically allows expart hearings
 
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
I think as a matter of sort of reality
 
00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
you have to be able to do something
 
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
quickly in certain
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
circumstances and throughout case law
 
00:47:39.069 --> 00:47:39.079 align:start position:0%
they've developed standards for expar or
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
temporary restraining orders and
 
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
interestingly those standards tend to be
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
higher than for a a a permanent order
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
because at the permanent order the other
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
party is
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
present as I read 173 B4 I actually
 
00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
think that there's a higher standard to
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
receive a temporary restraining order
 
00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
than there is under 173 B5 to receive a
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
permanent restraining order and that
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me that there's a higher
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
standard for the temporary order because
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
xar so I think that throughout you know
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
case law and jurist Prudence they've
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
developed these standards for for an
 
00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
expart hearing which have withstood
 
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.670 align:start position:0%
expart hearing which have withstood
constitutional

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
scrutiny thank
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
you with regard to um the
 
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
the case law I believe that is there
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
more civil case law that kind of backs
 
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
up the exart than criminal for example
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
in a u motion to dismiss is the standard
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
not always right in light most favorable
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
to the non-moving party who's not
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
available yeah in in civil cases you can
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
get um you know restraining orders
 
00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
temporary orders and generally the you
 
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
have to show that there'd be irreparable
 
00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
harm if there's not an immediate order
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
um and that you're likely to Prevail on
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
the merits to
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
essentially stay the proceeding or keep
 
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
things the way it
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
is and for all intents and purposes
 
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
although it falls within the criminal
 
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
statutes it's a civil proceeding this is
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
a civil proceeding yes it's the
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
violation that falls in the criminal mov
 
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
it into the criminal world thank you
 
00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:20.069 align:start position:0%
it into the criminal world thank you
representative

00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:49:22.349 --> 00:49:22.359 align:start position:0%
s thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question um just having looked
 
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
at some of the online testimony as well
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that's come up and
 
00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:30.839 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you're the best person
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
to answer this or perhaps one of our
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
police officers or other states
 
00:49:37.109 --> 00:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
attorneys who might be in present um
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
says that we have essentially red flag
 
00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
gun confiscation laws in RSA 173 and
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
633 um and I'm I'm not sure if you're
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
aware of that again I'm still doing my
 
00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
own research to understand all the
 
00:49:53.309 --> 00:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
details here but that um these types of
 
00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
orders are approved automatically by
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
judges with with no review and I wasn't
 
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
sure if you might have comment on that
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
um and um also on on some of the online
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
content that says that there's extremely
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
high storage fees for those whose guns
 
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
have been uh taken so with reference to
 
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
Red Flag laws in 173 and
 
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
633 633 3A is the stalking statute which
 
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
I assume is what they're referring
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
to saying that these don't get looked at
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
by a judge a temporary restraining
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't get looked at a judge is is just
 
00:50:30.789 --> 00:50:30.799 align:start position:0%
simply false um there is a standard in
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
173 B4 in order to obtain a temporary
 
00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:35.510 align:start position:0%
173 B4 in order to obtain a temporary
restraining

00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
restraining
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
order I've never attempted to obtain one
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
but I've had I've I've been in Circuit
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
Court almost every day for 17 years and
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
I've seen people obtain them and I've
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
seen people have them
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
denied um I also know from speaking to
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
members of the the co Coalition and
 
00:50:58.750 --> 00:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
people from crisis centers who accompany
 
00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:00.839 align:start position:0%
victims to try and get these hearings
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
that they're not always granted I know
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
from speaking to victims in criminal
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
cases they've indicated I applied for a
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
temporary restraining order it wasn't
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
granted so certainly the statement that
 
00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
you fill out a sheet of paper and this
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
is automatically granted is is just not
 
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
true with reference to the storage fees
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
again once 73 B5 section 10 C addresses
 
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
storage fees it says the law enforcement
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
agency May charge the defendant a
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable fee for the storage of any
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
firearms and ammunition and specified
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
deadly weapons taken pursuant to a
 
00:51:44.109 --> 00:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
protective order the fee shall not
 
00:51:46.349 --> 00:51:46.359 align:start position:0%
exceed the actual cost incurred by the
 
00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency for the storage
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
of the firearms and ammunition and
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
specified deadly weapons and then after
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
that it has the section about the
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
defendant being being able to make
 
00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.390 align:start position:0%
defendant being being able to make
alternative

00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
Arrangements I've never encountered
 
00:52:03.069 --> 00:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
storage fees I
 
00:52:05.309 --> 00:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
presume you could have the situation
 
00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
where you have a very small Department
 
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have a lot of storage and
 
00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
they seize a very large collection of
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
firearms and they have to store it
 
00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
offsite either by renting a storage
 
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
locker or by going to a local gun dealer
 
00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
and having them store it they can pass
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
that cost a Bel to the defendant but
 
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:28.750 align:start position:0%
that cost a Bel to the defendant but
they

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
can't this isn't the type of thing where
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
you can say well our property officer
 
00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
you know we pay him $50,000 a year to
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
look at your guns so we're going to
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
charge you
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
50,000 it the police can't profit on on
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
the storage and no up charges and the
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
and the court protocol addresses that
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
also and refers back to the to the
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
when you started your testimony um one
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
of the things that you uh indic the
 
00:53:05.069 --> 00:53:05.079 align:start position:0%
reason you indicated you were here was
 
00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
really for the victims of domestic
 
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
violence um should this bill as amended
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
or as proposed to be Amendment amended
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
goes through what would be the the
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
impact do you think on the the number of
 
00:53:22.789 --> 00:53:22.799 align:start position:0%
homicides the number of court cases that
 
00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
we see that are more severe are we
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:53:28.829 --> 00:53:28.839 align:start position:0%
small impact are we talking about a
 
00:53:28.839 --> 00:53:30.829 align:start position:0%
small impact are we talking about a
significant

00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
impact I I think it's hard to answer
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
that um which I don't I don't have the
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
statistics at my
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
fingertips but it's been my experience
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
and from talking to other people that
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
women tend to be murdered by people they
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
know um you know women tend not to be
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
murdered by Strangers in the Night it
 
00:53:58.109 --> 00:53:58.119 align:start position:0%
tends to be they're murdered by intimate
 
00:53:58.119 --> 00:53:59.789 align:start position:0%
tends to be they're murdered by intimate
partners

00:53:59.789 --> 00:53:59.799 align:start position:0%
partners
 
00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
and knowing that reality and reading
 
00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
some of the horrific things we've read
 
00:54:08.589 --> 00:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
in police reports where people are
 
00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
subject to domestic
 
00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.910 align:start position:0%
subject to domestic
violence

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
violence
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
it it it's striking to me
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
that if we have the
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity it this isn't like one of
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
these things where it's like oh
 
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
this random person may hurt me and has
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
the ability to hurt me this is literally
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
a person pointing a gun at someone's
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
head saying I am going to kill you with
 
00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.109 align:start position:0%
head saying I am going to kill you with
this

00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
gun and when that person finally gets to
 
00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
the point that they seek help from the
 
00:54:44.349 --> 00:54:44.359 align:start position:0%
state to protect them it seems common
 
00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
sense to take that gun from that
 
00:54:50.589 --> 00:54:50.599 align:start position:0%
person thank you I I can comment on that
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
that article I mentioned I was going to
 
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
provide that 2023 article it talks about
 
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
that in there and they cite some
 
00:54:56.829 --> 00:54:56.839 align:start position:0%
statistics and they footnote it within
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
the article and that's why I want to
 
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
submit the article separately they talk
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
about and I quote from the article more
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
than half of female homicide victims are
 
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
killed by a current or former male
 
00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
intimate partner and 96% of murder
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
suicide victims are female Firearms are
 
00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:12.559 align:start position:0%
used in more than 50% of intimate
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
partner related
 
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
homicides the article goes on to say
 
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
about a page or so later a victim or
 
00:55:21.029 --> 00:55:21.039 align:start position:0%
Survivor of intimate partner violence is
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
five times more likely to die when an
 
00:55:27.309 --> 00:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%

the legal the County attorneys that are
 
00:56:20.109 --> 00:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
here today and feel that this bill um
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
would prohibit law enforcement from
 
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me working towards ensuring the
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
safety of victims in the general public
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
um and it could lead to um increased
 
00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
homicides in the state of New
 
00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:33.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would comment on two other
 
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920 align:start position:0%

00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
speak towards local law enforcement but
 
00:56:56.029 --> 00:56:56.039 align:start position:0%

10733 repeals uh RC
 
00:58:15.069 --> 00:58:15.079 align:start position:0%
15838 a placement of simulated
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
explosives it reads any person who
 
00:58:20.029 --> 00:58:20.039 align:start position:0%
places or cause the placement of a
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
device simula explosive or other similar
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
dangerous substance or contrive in any
 
00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.510 align:start position:0%
dangerous substance or contrive in any
location

00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
location
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
thereby causing anxiety unrest fear or
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
personal discomfort to any person shall
 
00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
be guilty of a class a
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
felony uh the background for the
 
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
creation of this bill was uh a
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
constituent that was threatened with a
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
felony charge under the statue for
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
having a gag decoration on their car
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
during a traffic stop uh the con the
 
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
constituent was ordered to remove the
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
decoration or take the charge he
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
complied the uh the Law's broad scope uh
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
results in potential use and unjustified
 
00:58:58.349 --> 00:58:58.359 align:start position:0%
legal challenges the uh issues with the
 
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
current law is uh vagueness and
 
00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
overreach the law doesn't distinguish
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
between actual threats to Public Safety
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
and harmless objects um common gag items
 
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
like a uh at auto shops commonly you'll
 
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
see a gag with the grenade it says
 
00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
complaint department pull the pin I
 
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
think that would if someone got anxiety
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
from that they could uh the shop could
 
00:59:25.390 --> 00:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
be charged with the class a felony
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh so uh hang on I lost my spot sorry uh
 
00:59:33.029 --> 00:59:33.039 align:start position:0%
found places like our repair shops could
 
00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
be misconstrued as violations um so
 
00:59:38.349 --> 00:59:38.359 align:start position:0%
subjectivity and potential misuse a
 
00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
singles person anxiety irrespective of
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
context or intent can lead to a felony
 
00:59:45.069 --> 00:59:45.079 align:start position:0%
charge for example sometimes people have
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
things like pretend Claymores in yards
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
um and uh there's a this new business
 
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
model called an escape room where you go
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
into a room and the actual intent is to
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
cause anxiety uh there could be some
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
sort of fake explosive there um so I
 
01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
think that this could be misconstrued to
 
01:00:10.349 --> 01:00:10.359 align:start position:0%
uh charge those people as well um an
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
unnecessary legal burden so even if
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
courts dismiss such cases which I hope
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
they would uh in instances such as the
 
01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
constituent case um if it had been
 
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
prosecuted the accuse goes uh undergoes
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessary legal processes which
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
themselves are
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
punitive um so real life implications in
 
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
the case of my constituent the result to
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
remove the gag decaration to avoid a
 
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
felony charge highlights the Law's ex
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
exessive uh scope the this situation
 
01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
exemplifies the need for legal Clarity
 
01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.549 align:start position:0%
exemplifies the need for legal Clarity
and

01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
fairness um obviously it's not a good
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
situation when someone uh purposely
 
01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
causes a panic by placing a simulated
 
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:54.039 align:start position:0%
explosive for obvious reasons uh
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
therefore it's reasonable that the
 
01:00:57.309 --> 01:00:57.319 align:start position:0%
committee may not want to just outright
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
delete this um and I think the concerns
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
could be solved uh by a couple of
 
01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
amendments uh so to address the concerns
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
while ensuring Public Safety I suggest
 
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
uh following amendments so location
 
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
specifity uh private property should be
 
01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
exempt from the law so you should be
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
able to put whatever you want on your
 
01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
own property uh intent so the law should
 
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
required demonstratable intent to cause
 
01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
a panic
 
01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:27.160 align:start position:0%
uh reasonable standard the law should
 
01:01:29.029 --> 01:01:29.039 align:start position:0%
consider if it's reasonable for the
 
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
situation to cause anxiety and uh impact
 
01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
threshold uh a felony charge should
 
01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
require more than one person's
 
01:01:40.589 --> 01:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
discomfort uh so conclusion I'm ready to
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
work with the committee to draft
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
amendment that makes this bill
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable and fair makes this law of
 
01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable and fair uh ensuring Public
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
Safety without over criminalizing
 
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
innocent Behavior Uh thank you and I
 
01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:55.640 align:start position:0%
will take questions from the committee
 
01:01:58.109 --> 01:01:58.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um with regard
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
to to the gag uh thing on your uh
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
constituents was it a a a trailer hitch
 
01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:07.240 align:start position:0%
thing that said
 
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
Claymore uh I'm not exactly certain of
 
01:02:15.309 --> 01:02:15.319 align:start position:0%
what the actual uh the device was cuz I
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
pretty sure I I when I had a pickup
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
truck I had one it's a it's a trailer
 
01:02:22.349 --> 01:02:22.359 align:start position:0%
hitch cover that says face towards enemy
 
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
I I have seen that exact thing I just
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
don't know if it was the one the case of
 
01:02:28.349 --> 01:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
my constituent anyone who's ever
 
01:02:30.069 --> 01:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
actually used an actual Claymore knows
 
01:02:32.029 --> 01:02:32.039 align:start position:0%
that they don't look like that at all
 
01:02:35.309 --> 01:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
and there's much more required to use
 
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you see you no further
 
01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
01:02:38.359 --> 01:02:41.349 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
thank

01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:55.960 align:start position:0%
Davy but this this needs to work
 
01:02:57.269 --> 01:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
morning ladies and gentlemen my name is
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
Brendan Davy I'm a captain with the New
 
01:03:01.269 --> 01:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police with one month
 
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
shy of 23 years of service 16 years in
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
Patrol uh seven years at headquarters
 
01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
with Recruitment and training policy and
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
compliance and now field area uh
 
01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
Captain the Department of Safety
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
Division of State Police uh stands in
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill uh for the
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
reason that to
 
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh to delete a as it sponsor uh has
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
stated it this provision and its
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
entirety is to leave public uh the
 
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
public at risk to the Spectre which I
 
01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
submit we increasingly see swatting
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
calls and uh and hoax devices at the end
 
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
of the day I do not disagree uh with the
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
the bill sponsor that amendments could
 
01:03:49.109 --> 01:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
be in order uh a felony requires a
 
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
culpable mental state and a culpable
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
mental state ought to be put into this
 
01:03:57.230 --> 01:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
law uh a reasonable person standard is
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
built into uh a criminal threatening
 
01:04:02.349 --> 01:04:02.359 align:start position:0%
statute for example and that could be
 
01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
built into this law um I would submit
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
that the uh
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
improvident decision of one police
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
officer uh is not reason uh sufficient
 
01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
to to Warrant deleting uh a law removing
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
from law prescription on behavior that
 
01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
in many cases is utterly reasonable in
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the response that it uh
 
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
provokes and needs to be so uh in the
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
age of terrorism um from both foreign
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
and domestic actors and
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh would submit that the the the court
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
would protect that citizen as they did
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
in the case of a loaded firearm where
 
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
the the law is clear uh and a police
 
01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
officer misread and misapplied so uh
 
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testim ony in this
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
matter and uh I'd be happy to take
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um and your your
 
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
comments regarding a reasonable person
 
01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:05.079 align:start position:0%
and certainly intent are well taken I'm
 
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
reading a statute it doesn't mention
 
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
intent and it seems to me that should be
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
the the whole point of the statute would
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
be to with placing something with intent
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
to cause fear and anxiety not just
 
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
simply having something but yes sir any
 
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
further questions for the captain seen
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
none thank you for oh I missed one I
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
how often do you see something like this
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
how often does it come up uh in in a an
 
01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
effort to understand the scope of this
 
01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
problem just with State Police sir I I
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
did look up uh for the last calendar
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
year 2023 the number of uh bomb squad
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
responses so we get a suspicious package
 
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
uh a backpack left somewhere where it it
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh raises the suspicion of of members of
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
the public and and over that period of
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
time um I know that our our bomb squad
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
handles something on the order of 800
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
calls for service per year many of those
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
are relinquishments of uh old ordinance
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
people find uh ammunition in their
 
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
basements that belong to family members
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
who've passed away things of that nature
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
um so it's difficult to say what the
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
number of these is I can tell you it is
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
significant when we get a a suspected
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
device somewhere um the the scope of the
 
01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:27.799 align:start position:0%
response that that comes to that when we
 
01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
have yet to uh determine that it is a
 
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
hoax uh is it's of a magnitude that
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
that's very expensive in terms of all
 
01:06:39.069 --> 01:06:39.079 align:start position:0%
form of resources and it's very
 
01:06:41.309 --> 01:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
disruptive to people's lives that said
 
01:06:41.319 --> 01:06:42.190 align:start position:0%
disruptive to people's lives that said
to

01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
decriminalize what would reasonably
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
result in that response is is just a bad
 
01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
idea thank you yes sir representative s
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
thank you um to follow up on on that um
 
01:06:57.150 --> 01:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
curious um so if hypothetically there
 
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
was a threat here today right now what
 
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
would be the um like how does the squad
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
get activated and then what's the cost
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
for um dealing with and just you know
 
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
identifying either that it's a hoax
 
01:07:13.269 --> 01:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
device or detonating something because
 
01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
it can't be determined prior to
 
01:07:16.829 --> 01:07:16.839 align:start position:0%
detonation whether or not it's a hoax
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
device um cost is difficult to calculate
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
ma but um if there were a call in this
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
building right now um depending on the
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
quality of the information this whole
 
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
place could be cleaned out entirely
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
disrupted uh staff used to identify to
 
01:07:37.789 --> 01:07:37.799 align:start position:0%
look for and identify a device uh law
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement brought in to manage traffic
 
01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
and keep people out uh for a certain
 
01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
blast radius based on the description of
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
the device itself uh because it's not
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
direct exposure to device that can kill
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
people it's compressive blast as well
 
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
that will uh will damage um
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
aquous organs and kill people as well so
 
01:07:59.950 --> 01:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
it there could be hundreds of police
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
officers here in in pretty short uh time
 
01:08:05.789 --> 01:08:05.799 align:start position:0%
and extremely disruptive so many of
 
01:08:07.309 --> 01:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
those people could be called from other
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
areas of the state or held out on
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
overtime or activated from an off-duty
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
status and so therefore it would be very
 
01:08:16.829 --> 01:08:16.839 align:start position:0%
expensive but we'd get to go home for
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
the day is what you're saying yes sir
 
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
that was not a suggestion to anyone just
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
checking all right thank you for your
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
testimony oh what who oh Stone thank you
 
01:08:30.269 --> 01:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
and I'll be very quick uh any of the
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
incidents that your bomb disposed unit
 
01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
responded to did that involve any
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
commercially produced items such as the
 
01:08:38.669 --> 01:08:38.679 align:start position:0%
uh gag gifts such as the dynamite clock
 
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
or the trailer hitch Claymore Mine or
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
the complaint grenade that you probably
 
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
have seen yourself over the course of
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
your career no sir and there again it's
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
the reasonable person standard on one
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
side it's a reasonable police officer
 
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
standard on the other I I pointed out a
 
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
claym a claymore trailer hitch to my
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
wife the other day see how it says Point
 
01:08:59.950 --> 01:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
towards enemy so thank you thank you I'm
 
01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
I'm certain I have one in my garage
 
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
because it was on my truck yes sir I
 
01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:05.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate that we'll work I also may
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
have a a inner old tank around somewhere
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
but I mean it's you know yeah
 
01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:14.630 align:start position:0%
but I mean it's you know yeah
representative

01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.550 --> 01:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
cite i' I'd like you to further comment
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
on the improvident providential off
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
Trooper or officer if he saw an incident
 
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
that could be arguably considered a
 
01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
felony a and offered the detainee the
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
option to remove it I think that sounds
 
01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
to me very
 
01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
providential I mean
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
I not would you want to rethink that
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
adjective not on the basis of the
 
01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
characterization of the events sir its
 
01:09:50.349 --> 01:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
characterization was what was clearly a
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
gag was uh used as this is going to be
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
labeled with my initials as exhibit a in
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
a felony case against you so I I think
 
01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.990 align:start position:0%
a felony case against you so I I think
it

01:09:58.990 --> 01:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:10:02.189 --> 01:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed as described that's all
 
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
thank you yes there be no further
 
01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:05.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to testify on this
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
bill who is not testified seeing none I
 
01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
hereby close the public hearing and I
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on House Bill
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
1599 and invite the respons to introduce
 
01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:22.630 align:start position:0%
1599 and invite the respons to introduce
this

01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
bill

01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
all right good morning chairman Roy and
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I am
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative Sant naso representing
 
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
the towns of Rin Jaffrey and
 
01:10:37.709 --> 01:10:37.719 align:start position:0%
Dublin this bill affirms that the second
 
01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
amendment protects individuals right to
 
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
employ weapons capable of making
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
decisions uh autonomously with the use
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
of artificial
 
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
intelligence the this uh affirmation is
 
01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
crucial as these kinds of weapons
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
already exist it's somewhat daunting to
 
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
acknowledge our progression into an era
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
where machines control weapons but
 
01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
Humanity will adapt to this new reality
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
as we always
 
01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
have uh a common image that comes to
 
01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
mind when discussing AI weapons is
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
something akin to the Terminator uh
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
while it's probable that such weapons
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
will exist uh I want to First highlight
 
01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
a practical example where this bill will
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
protect the the public so imagine a
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
woman being mugged in a parking lot uh
 
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
an autonomous car either hers or someone
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
else's uh is able to detect the
 
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
situation and it determines it can
 
01:11:23.709 --> 01:11:23.719 align:start position:0%
intervene by pushing the mugger away if
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to act without human
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
interference it will do so promptly
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise it might require the woman to
 
01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
press a button to initiate the reaction
 
01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
uh the action uh however the women may
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
be physically unable to press the button
 
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
or may not realize this as a viable
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
solution uh if the software can reach
 
01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
the same conclusion as a reasonable
 
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
person would in the same circumstances
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
then it could be allowed to take the
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
action without human intervention and we
 
01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't delay these life-saving
 
01:11:51.070 --> 01:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
measures especially as we move into an
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
environment filled with autonomous
 
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
machines uh we shouldn't say sorry you
 
01:11:56.189 --> 01:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
got mugged but the government demands
 
01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
that you first must answer a text
 
01:11:59.790 --> 01:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
message from your car before these
 
01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
defense measures measures are put into
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
action uh furthermore it's reasonable to
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
imagine that in such situations
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence might be better
 
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
suited uh to using an appropriate level
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
of force whereas a person might be
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
justified in using lethal force with
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
something like a firearm without the
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
protective intervention of AI just in
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
the same way self-driving cars are
 
01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
expected to cause less accidents than
 
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
human drivers um so uh AI can infer the
 
01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
image of someone looking at it's can
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
infer the image that someone is looking
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
at based on just a scan of a brain wave
 
01:12:39.310 --> 01:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
um so the ACT what what a what AI is
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
going to be able to infer about what's
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
going on it's going to be uh oh it's
 
01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
going to be with perfect Precision uh so
 
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
the the world we're moving into with
 
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
this stuff is going to be uh so foreign
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
that in the future in order to describe
 
01:12:53.149 --> 01:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
the way we live today will only be
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
possible possible I think in religious
 
01:12:58.750 --> 01:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
terms uh AI driven weapons have the
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
potential to offer greater precision and
 
01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
reduced collateral damage compared to
 
01:13:04.629 --> 01:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
their human operated counterparts uh
 
01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
these systems can make rapid
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
calculations and decisions based on a
 
01:13:09.310 --> 01:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
multitude of factors aiming to
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
neutralized threats with minimal harm to
 
01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
bystanders and
 
01:13:14.629 --> 01:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
infrastructure this Precision makes the
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
use of force more ethical and also more
 
01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
effective and complex real world
 
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
scenarios uh a couple other examples uh
 
01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
that could be a reality like uh today
 
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
you'll hear a lot there's stories where
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
uh High speech police chases going on
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
and it's stopped by a trucker who saw
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
the situation and then moved his truck
 
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
into that lane uh the suspect is driving
 
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
in causing an accident and then
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
potentially saving lives that could have
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
been caused if the pursuit was allowed
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
to continue um so I'm saying that
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
someone's autonomous car in a parking
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
lot could you know maybe has assist
 
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
police mode turned on by the owner or
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
something like this and could be alerted
 
01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
to a similar situation stop the car
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
because because it's physically
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
positioned in a strategic location that
 
01:13:59.950 --> 01:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
benefits the police by chance um and or
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
maybe five cars could be activated just
 
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
block the road the driver's going down
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
ahead of time um so it's not that you
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
know I think they're going to outfit
 
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
your household toaster with the with the
 
01:14:12.629 --> 01:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
firearm inside it or something but that
 
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
you know it already exists so maybe it
 
01:14:16.669 --> 01:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
has Intelligence it can detect these
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
situations and it can maybe uh do
 
01:14:21.149 --> 01:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
something to mitigate a situation uh
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
there'll be Hardware all over the place
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh that that we should leverage for our
 
01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
advantage things like automatically
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
locking Doors and Rooms until police
 
01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
arrive that's a use of force decision uh
 
01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
turning on and off lights uh you know
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's robot vacuums I don't know
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
people come up with things and they're
 
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
very creative um Firearms have been
 
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
called the great equalizer where a 5-
 
01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
Foot Woman armed with a handgun can
 
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
defend herself from a significantly more
 
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
powerful man uh this is true but it
 
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
requires that the women learn and
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
understand how to use a firearm and stay
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
current on training learn safety
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
techniques AI weapons will be even more
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
so an equalizer to include those who are
 
01:15:01.629 --> 01:15:01.639 align:start position:0%
unable to wield firearms and are unable
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
uh unwilling to learn how to use them
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
and providing safety and defense
 
01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
capabilities to those who might
 
01:15:08.590 --> 01:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise be physically vulnerable like
 
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
the elderly or
 
01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
disabled so a crude version of a weapon
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
that has the ability to make a uh a use
 
01:15:17.709 --> 01:15:17.719 align:start position:0%
of force decision has already existed
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
for centuries uh things like booby traps
 
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
and landmines uh so booby traps have
 
01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:25.400 align:start position:0%
basic they're outlawed by numerous case
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
law uh example of a booby trap is like a
 
01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
shotgun with a trigger tied to a door so
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
such that when the door opens it kills
 
01:15:34.189 --> 01:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
the person opening it so there's some
 
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
binary intelligence there it just kills
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
whoever opens that particular door so uh
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
the bill States the decision of
 
01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
autonomous artificial intelligence is
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
subject to the same standards as
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
described in this chapter as if a
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
natural person made the decision uh if
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
the decision of the autonomous
 
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence deemed not
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
Justified on this chapter justification
 
01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
shall not be available as a defense in
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
any action or prosecution brought
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
against the owner or employer of the
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence so since it's
 
01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
unreasonable for a person to make a kill
 
01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
a decision to kill based solely on a
 
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
particular door open uh this sort of
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
weapon would not be protected by
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
this AI weapons are here in March of
 
01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
2020 a quadcopter drone with an
 
01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
explosive payload in Libya autonomously
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
hunted down and killed a human Target in
 
01:16:21.149 --> 01:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
a kamakazi style attack with no human
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
intervention after deployment Poss
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
possibly uh being the first time a drone
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
has been used to autonomously kill a
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
human uh the thing about these kind of
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
weapons that are unlike the Terminator
 
01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:35.320 align:start position:0%
type movies that try to portray such
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
things is when you see the hero uh
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
evading the gunfire from the
 
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
machine in reality the machine will
 
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
never miss the hero will not be running
 
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
through gun power it'll have
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
near-perfect targeting to with the
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
ability to predict your movements
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
they'll have a perfect shot every
 
01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
time uh so without these countermeasures
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh we stand little chance against such
 
01:16:59.149 --> 01:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
weapons drones are inexpensive and the
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
software will be if not already ready
 
01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
readily available and runs on consumer
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
grade Hardware making regulation to
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
prevent these weapons futile AI software
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
requires very powerful computers and
 
01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
massive amounts of data to create but
 
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
once generated can run on consumer grade
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
Hardware uh for example stable diffus a
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
stable diffusion model uh encapsulating
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
a Pera of Artistic Styles cultural
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
nuances and drawing techniques for a
 
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
myriad of artists is compacted in less
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
than 5 gigabytes it isn't merely data
 
01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
it's a condensed Universe of human
 
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
creativity and intellect uh it's totally
 
01:17:38.629 --> 01:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
unbelievable that requires so little dis
 
01:17:40.229 --> 01:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
base and is capable of running on an
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
ordinary standard off-the-shelf
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
computer uh and once these models are
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
generated they are promptly leaked for
 
01:17:50.110 --> 01:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
the world to use like meta's llama model
 
01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
which met headlines in March of 2023
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
after being leaked into a forchan uh a
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
week after its
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
Announcement by acknowledging this
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
existing right uh we may open this
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
industry up for development in Hampshire
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
where other jurisdiction's initial
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
reaction to AI will be an attempt to
 
01:18:07.229 --> 01:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
limit it hereby making the government in
 
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
that area less Revenant relevant as AI
 
01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
becomes more relevant uh AI will greatly
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
exacerbate asymmetrical Warfare so
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
asymmetrical warair is being is things
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
like uh an American humy with you know
 
01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
and soldiers getting killed and the in
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
destroying the Humvee uh with nothing
 
01:18:28.510 --> 01:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
more than just a single roadside bomb uh
 
01:18:30.669 --> 01:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
AI will increas greatly increase this
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
Delta to allow a group with very small
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
means the capability to destroy major
 
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
targets um an example could be a
 
01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
malicious person or group could spend a
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
couple hundred bucks to purchase an RC
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
helicopter or drone from uh Amazon or
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
Walmart outfit it with a computer and a
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
bomb and then instruct the computer uh
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
to Target a particular person using
 
01:18:52.590 --> 01:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
images obtained online um and then the
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
helic opter could literally wait for the
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
Target to exit their house fly up to
 
01:18:58.830 --> 01:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
them and explode uh this could be done
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
from hundreds of miles away or even a
 
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
sign a sophisticated attack from
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
elsewhere targeting People based on
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
ethnicity political affiliation or the
 
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
religion the AI could just look at
 
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
people and just determine if they're of
 
01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
one of these groups uh so a defense of
 
01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing isn't obvious with
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
conventional means um attempting to
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
police everyone deploying such weapons
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
would require a IAL government because
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
you'd have to ban all sorts of Hardware
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
Implement extreme tracking on all
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
purchases and monitor all internet
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
traffic and monitor all people uh
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
because the stuff is too it's going to
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
be too easy to get uh by allowing these
 
01:19:36.990 --> 01:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
weapons to exist without countermeasures
 
01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
will also lead to tyranny as governments
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
and potential hostile entities uh
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
develop these weapons it's vital that
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
citizens also have access to comparable
 
01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
defense Technologies to maintain a
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
balance of power this parody helps
 
01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
prevent a scenario where the general
 
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
public is left defenseless against a
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
more technological Advanced threat
 
01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
whether it come from within or outside
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
National borders that's why I believe we
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
should affirm that the second amendment
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
protects individuals rights to bear arms
 
01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
for this next generation of weapons uh
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and I will take questions from
 
01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:11.669 align:start position:0%
thank you and I will take questions from
the

01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative
 
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
um I've for 20 years I've wanted my own
 
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
Terminator I just don't know that I
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
could afford it wouldn't you say this is
 
01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
regressive and that only rich people
 
01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
will be able to afford these type of
 
01:20:28.510 --> 01:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
these things and people of limited means
 
01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
will not how much would one of these
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
things cost I would believe any type of
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
automated um system that would capable
 
01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
of fire firing a firearm would be very
 
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
expensive uh that's true I also I can't
 
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
afford uh my own tank I'd like one of
 
01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
those uh do that authoriz uh that that
 
01:20:48.430 --> 01:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
would be an expensive that's a
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
conventional weapon that is available
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
right now uh so a lot of these weapons I
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
think will be integrated into existing
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
Hardware just like my examples with the
 
01:21:00.030 --> 01:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
autonomous cars this Hardware is going
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
to be built and it's going to be
 
01:21:03.310 --> 01:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
autonomous uh there's going to be
 
01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
machines that do everything like locking
 
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
doors automatically and stuff like this
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm saying that blocking someone in
 
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
a room is a use of force decision uh and
 
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
this could be decided
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
autonomously uh I think better you know
 
01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
potentially better than a human could
 
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
make that decision um and since that
 
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
Hardware is there and the software's
 
01:21:27.629 --> 01:21:27.639 align:start position:0%
already there it's just allowing it to
 
01:21:30.430 --> 01:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
do these things um and that's why there
 
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
should be liability on the owner of the
 
01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
uh actual
 
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
software representative
 
01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
Pro so that was pretty much my question
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
I have all this stuff in my car or
 
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
wherever and it makes a wrong decision
 
01:21:47.709 --> 01:21:47.719 align:start position:0%
and kills somebody who's responsible for
 
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
that right who's going to jail for that
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
so just like uh one of the problems with
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
that with uh self-driving cars is people
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
like well if the car makes an accident
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
and kills somebody uh who's responsible
 
01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
for that um and it's not that an
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
accident will never happen but accidents
 
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
happen today and I would just argue that
 
01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
there'll be less accidents uh it'll be
 
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
that the AI just like in the
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
self-driving it's going to overall be
 
01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
better um but who would be responsible
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
as the owner of the actual
 
01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
system as it's so if it's my system
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
and I tell it not to and it still does I
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
go to jail well uh I'm not exactly sure
 
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
how the Market's going to play out on it
 
01:22:33.390 --> 01:22:33.400 align:start position:0%
but what I would suspect is that you
 
01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
would have a subscription to it uh I
 
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
don't know you know the market could
 
01:22:38.629 --> 01:22:38.639 align:start position:0%
come up with all sorts of creative
 
01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
things but I would suspect if you bought
 
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
the car the manufacturer of the car
 
01:22:46.110 --> 01:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
would provide that software um and they
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
it so we don't really have this
 
01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
technology to a point that we know what
 
01:22:59.149 --> 01:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
it is know how proficient it is how
 
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
reliable it is and we want to legalize
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
it is that is that
 
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
your premise of this bill just like
 
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
today if you uh go ahead and make a use
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
of force decision that's that's
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
incorrect right you'd be prosecuted for
 
01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:17.560 align:start position:0%
that so if you implemented a weapon that
 
01:23:19.350 --> 01:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
makes a use of force decision that's
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
wrong you would you would face the same
 
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.030 align:start position:0%
wrong you would you would face the same
consequence

01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
consequence
 
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
um so it's just affirming that this
 
01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:28.990 align:start position:0%
um so it's just affirming that this
already

01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
exists representative um
 
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
new thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:23:37.709 --> 01:23:37.719 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I just you you
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know you're talking about
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
um autonomous cars and um also you know
 
01:23:45.870 --> 01:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
the facial recognition and um I'm just
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
wondering have you heard about the many
 
01:23:52.189 --> 01:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
stories of autonomous vehicles um uh
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
going AR and causing accidents that that
 
01:23:57.149 --> 01:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
even the operator cannot stop um cars
 
01:23:58.830 --> 01:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
that are being recalled exactly for that
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
reason also um the Discrimination that
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
is built into the bias that is built
 
01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
into facial recognition this has been
 
01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
shown demonstrated time and time again
 
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
and um you know the thing being that an
 
01:24:11.229 --> 01:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
algorithm is still informed by people um
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
and still can be uh misinformed and
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
reflect the biases of the people who
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
create that algorithm and I'm just
 
01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
curious are you aware of that and are
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
you concerned about that with with
 
01:24:24.030 --> 01:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
technology like this um used for
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
um defense in and things like
 
01:24:30.669 --> 01:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
that uh yes of course but uh human
 
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
operators have biases as well uh and I
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
think that the AI you know it's the
 
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility is still on the is still
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
on the owner just as if the AI makes an
 
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
erroneous decision uh it would be on the
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.590 align:start position:0%
 
already

01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:56.590 align:start position:0%
already
representative

01:24:56.590 --> 01:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you um I'll just call your
 
01:25:03.149 --> 01:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
attention to the on Guess on page two
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
that the line that begins on 23 that
 
01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
says if the decision of the aut
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
autonomous artificial intelligence is
 
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
deemed not justified under this
 
01:25:16.669 --> 01:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
chapter justification shall not be
 
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
available as a defense in any action of
 
01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
prosecution brought against the owner or
 
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
employer of the artificial
 
01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
intelligence could you just point me to
 
01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
anything in the bill in the if I don't
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
think there's an amendment to the bill
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
or anywhere else in this chapter where
 
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
it defines who makes that decision since
 
01:25:37.470 --> 01:25:37.480 align:start position:0%
this is a new a whole new thing about
 
01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:39.430 align:start position:0%
this is a new a whole new thing about
artificial

01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
artificial
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
intelligence uh yeah if it's not
 
01:25:45.550 --> 01:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
outlined correctly we can uh fix it um
 
01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
it's if the Bill's not totally complete
 
01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
then we can work on
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.510 align:start position:0%
that thank
you

01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:57.229 --> 01:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chairman this is a
 
01:25:58.990 --> 01:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
frightening New Era and I'm really
 
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
outside of my my scope of expertise but
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
would this be hackable could China or
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
one of our enemies hack into these these
 
01:26:11.550 --> 01:26:11.560 align:start position:0%
um AI things and cause
 
01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:15.400 align:start position:0%
harm so thank you yes it's actually
 
01:26:17.950 --> 01:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
particularly my worry that these uh
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
there's going to be atom machines all
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
over the place that could be hacked um
 
01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
but the problem is I I would rather live
 
01:26:29.109 --> 01:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
in the 20th century but these these
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
machines are going to be they're going
 
01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
to exist they already exist there's
 
01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:34.719 align:start position:0%
already cars that are built today are
 
01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
fly by wire you're communicating with a
 
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
computer when you control the steering
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
wheel it doesn't have a steering shaft
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
um and right now somebody could put
 
01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
software on those vehicles and make it
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
do something erroneous uh so this is in
 
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
my opinion a way to protect against
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
those kind of things
 
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.109 align:start position:0%
those kind of things
um

01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
representa thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:27:00.030 --> 01:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I Echo what
 
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
representative Reed just said it's I
 
01:27:03.109 --> 01:27:03.119 align:start position:0%
felt like we were in science and
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
technology there for a second this is a
 
01:27:09.149 --> 01:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
little bit out of my scope um but I also
 
01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
uh My worry is that these Technologies
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
are uh I
 
01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
mean are they're really self-defense or
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
assist police Technologies built into uh
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
the Tesla cars or I mean what is the
 
01:27:29.629 --> 01:27:29.639 align:start position:0%
reality of uh of what these devices are
 
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
what they can do uh I'm just trying to
 
01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
get an idea of what the AI device would
 
01:27:37.229 --> 01:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
be and how it would be used as defense
 
01:27:38.669 --> 01:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
would people just be able to have these
 
01:27:38.679 --> 01:27:39.990 align:start position:0%
would people just be able to have these
military-grade

01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
military-grade
 
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
quadcopters that were out in Libya or or
 
01:27:45.109 --> 01:27:45.119 align:start position:0%
are we talking about uh cars that are
 
01:27:45.119 --> 01:27:45.990 align:start position:0%
are we talking about uh cars that are
able

01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
able
 
01:27:48.590 --> 01:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
to move to one lane or the other to stop
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
a an accident or something like
 
01:27:51.119 --> 01:27:53.030 align:start position:0%
a an accident or something like
that

01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
so uh things like these quadcopter
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
things that in limbya that example I
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
used I just I believe that they're going
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
to be way too cheap to produce uh so
 
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
anybody could make these right now I
 
01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
think you could just go spend less than
 
01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
probably $1,000 and build something
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
comparable to what hunted down that
 
01:28:16.270 --> 01:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
person in 2020 um so because the threat
 
01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
is there I think we should not prohibit
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh people from using the same kind of
 
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
themselves and to answer your question
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
um they are capable of programming all
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of things into cars if if the
 
01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
government mandated it they could
 
01:28:37.709 --> 01:28:37.719 align:start position:0%
program a kill switch into most cars
 
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
that the police would just be able to
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
shut it off I have seen that um
 
01:28:42.510 --> 01:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
representative Muse and then
 
01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:46.270 align:start position:0%
representative Muse and then
representative

01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
PE if you see this technology as being
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
such a problem why doesn't your bill
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
just make it
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
illegal uh the reason why is because I
 
01:28:58.709 --> 01:28:58.719 align:start position:0%
don't believe that's it's possible I
 
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
think that by making it illegal it the
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
only way you could carry it out by
 
01:29:06.910 --> 01:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
having an extreme tyan uh tyrannical
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
government because the I mean what does
 
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
it cost to buy one a drone I mean they
 
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
cost nothing and bombs and these the
 
01:29:17.229 --> 01:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
software is readily available uh they
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
can't protect the software and it runs
 
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
on a regular a regular GPU can you can
 
01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
run these Advanced AI uh you know uh
 
01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
what do they call them like large
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
language models and the neural networks
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
and stuff and have it create artwork and
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
come up with it can write entire uh
 
01:29:38.109 --> 01:29:38.119 align:start position:0%
books you know on on on Hardware that's
 
01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh cheap so to prohibit people from
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
having that is it's impossible it's too
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
easy to
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
construct thank
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
PR are you aware that arm drones are
 
01:29:54.109 --> 01:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
already legal in the
 
01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
state uh if they're illegal or not legal
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
it's you could just buy one I understand
 
01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
that they're specifically um mentioned
 
01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
as illegal for use in um surveilling or
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
chasing game by um by taking of game uh
 
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you for
 
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you and the chair
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:24.070 align:start position:0%
 
again

01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:25.990 --> 01:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you ladies and
 
01:30:28.109 --> 01:30:28.119 align:start position:0%
gentlemen again I'm captain Brendan Davy
 
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire State Police uh just
 
01:30:32.669 --> 01:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
short of 23 years of service and uh 15
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
and a half of those on our SWAT team uh
 
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
I've seen a YouTube video of a
 
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
quadcopter with a Glock pistol attached
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
to it um it's one of the more
 
01:30:42.189 --> 01:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
frightening things I've ever seen
 
01:30:43.709 --> 01:30:43.719 align:start position:0%
despite the the real things that I've
 
01:30:46.109 --> 01:30:46.119 align:start position:0%
seen that are quite frightening um I
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
would submit to you that many of the
 
01:30:49.629 --> 01:30:49.639 align:start position:0%
sponsors responses to your questions
 
01:30:52.510 --> 01:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
were indicative of his hesitation to uh
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
trust this technology and uh the
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
department of
 
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
safety's uh standpoint and and view on
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation uh is uh in keeping
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
with those hesitations and we oppose it
 
01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
anything that removes the direct sense
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
of ownership agency and therefore
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
culpability in any use of
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
force is not something that uh the state
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
police would Embrace because it makes
 
01:31:24.910 --> 01:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
more difficult to uh hold to account the
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
actions that resulted in death or
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
serious bodily injury or deprivation of
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
right in any other way uh and so uh we
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
we oppose the bill um with regard to uh
 
01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
the use of AI I would submit to you that
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
that Genie is already out of the bottle
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that any system that
 
01:31:48.430 --> 01:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
has AI um that the mere inclusion of a
 
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
few new lines of code is what can make
 
01:31:53.790 --> 01:31:53.800 align:start position:0%
an autonomous system system uh or make a
 
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
a uh an intelligent system to Anye any
 
01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:57.310 align:start position:0%
a uh an intelligent system to Anye any
degree

01:31:57.310 --> 01:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
degree
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
autonomous uh while I would agree that
 
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence well used very
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
welld designed extremely robustly tested
 
01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
uh can outperform Humanity in certain
 
01:32:11.229 --> 01:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
tasks uh Israeli defense mechanisms as
 
01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
they exist right now can identify an
 
01:32:16.109 --> 01:32:16.119 align:start position:0%
incoming rocket in one millisecond where
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
the human being is capable only of
 
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
perceiving it at about 250 milliseconds
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
and then limited further in its response
 
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
time uh artificial intelligence is not
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
prone to emotion it is not prone to
 
01:32:31.229 --> 01:32:31.239 align:start position:0%
fatigue those are certainly advantages
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
that can and will be uh made use of at
 
01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
some point in the future uh as of right
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
now if someone flew that drone with a
 
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
Glock on it in New Hampshire and used it
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
to do harm to someone State Police would
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
still have a case on our hands and the
 
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office would expect
 
01:32:49.470 --> 01:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
us to investigate prove ownership prove
 
01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
agency prove culpability and uh and
 
01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
secure a conviction if at all possible I
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
would submit that uh the main examples
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
of the use of artificial intelligence
 
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
for autonomous delivery of any uh
 
01:33:06.030 --> 01:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
methodology of force outside of this
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
this one uh Glock on a on a quadcopter
 
01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
are military and therefore Elon Musk and
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
his ilk are the only people likely to be
 
01:33:18.030 --> 01:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
able to employ these things with any uh
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
significant effect um the uh the use of
 
01:33:27.109 --> 01:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
AI in military uh situations is under
 
01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
intense scrutiny and at the same time
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
that is recognize that there is an arms
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
race that the country uh or state that
 
01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
develops these best and first and most
 
01:33:39.390 --> 01:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
readily will probably trouts those who
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
Trail um there are also serious ethical
 
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
concerns that have been spoken to a bit
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
here today so for all the reasons for
 
01:33:47.629 --> 01:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
going uh State Police and Department of
 
01:33:50.109 --> 01:33:50.119 align:start position:0%
Safety would oppose this
 
01:33:53.229 --> 01:33:53.239 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you k Captain to the
 
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
best of your knowledge is there not
 
01:33:58.510 --> 01:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
currently available um for a significant
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
expense but available firearms that have
 
01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
a certain level of AI in them in that
 
01:34:07.109 --> 01:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
they adjust for windage automatically um
 
01:34:09.149 --> 01:34:09.159 align:start position:0%
depending on the round in the distance
 
01:34:10.750 --> 01:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
um they actually adjust they're called
 
01:34:13.229 --> 01:34:13.239 align:start position:0%
smart rifles um some of them even be
 
01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
online of sight yes sir I've read that
 
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
there are such things there there are uh
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
some computer uh some computer guiding
 
01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
systems that do assist with Munitions as
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
I understand as
 
01:34:28.590 --> 01:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative
 
01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
jamron thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
01:34:35.229 --> 01:34:35.239 align:start position:0%
question uh we we've already established
 
01:34:38.189 --> 01:34:38.199 align:start position:0%
that set guns are illegal and that
 
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
police officers and Firearms defense
 
01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
experts who engage in shoot don't shoot
 
01:34:45.629 --> 01:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
situations don't always agree on if they
 
01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
got it right which leads to
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
litigation um do you believe that a AI
 
01:34:54.669 --> 01:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
can take the place of a human brain at
 
01:34:57.550 --> 01:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
this point to make those
 
01:35:01.229 --> 01:35:01.239 align:start position:0%
decisions at this point sir no and
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr chairman do you
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
believe that the human brain can make
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
mistakes absolutely sir thank you yes
 
01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
sir represent wheeler thank you Mr
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:35:16.990 --> 01:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
question um so if someone were to use a
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
quadcopter commit murder and the
 
01:35:21.709 --> 01:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
department of safety only saw the quad
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
opter was able to get it down how would
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
you prosecute that person who launched
 
01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:29.159 align:start position:0%
that drone if there was a way to do that
 
01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
yes sir uh we'd have to determine
 
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
ownership control uh and work our way
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
back to the person who who had conducted
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
um that act through technology and that
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
would clearly be a much more difficult
 
01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
thing than a person with a gun in his
 
01:35:46.109 --> 01:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
hand thank you yes
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
sir representative Newman I
 
01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
see yeah I just have uh question that
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
deals with the last comment um if if I
 
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
had my 9 millimeter set up somewhere
 
01:36:01.870 --> 01:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
automatically withd draw in wait a
 
01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:04.360 align:start position:0%
minute did you just Adit you have a 9 mm
 
01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
what what did I say
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
um I don't remember what I said oh do I
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
live for your die sir go ahead let me uh
 
01:36:18.750 --> 01:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
restate that if a person had a 9
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
mm and the and they had artificial
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
intelligence at their disposal and they
 
01:36:24.990 --> 01:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
could activate the artificial
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
intelligence to to immediately draw the
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
gun and shoot in a at whatever is they
 
01:36:33.070 --> 01:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
deemed to be threatening
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
them do you see a difference between
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
that whether I pull the trigger or or
 
01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
whether that person pulls the trigger or
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
whether they activate the artificial
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
intelligence to do that how how would
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
that work in the
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
situation it's a difficult question to
 
01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
answer but at the end of the day uh what
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
I would uh speculate here that at trial
 
01:36:59.870 --> 01:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to say that it was the AI
 
01:37:01.470 --> 01:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
that made the bad decision and not you
 
01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is it's still all
 
01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
yours um and that makes securing a
 
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
conviction for what ultimately really
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
what ultimately would result in perhaps
 
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
an unjustified loss of life still your
 
01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility just a lot more difficult
 
01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:16.950 align:start position:0%
responsibility just a lot more difficult
to

01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
prove I have a question to the chair can
 
01:37:20.910 --> 01:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
I can I just make a comment about
 
01:37:22.990 --> 01:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
something thing that I've air traffic
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
control and automation that may be
 
01:37:26.709 --> 01:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
relevant to what we're talking about and
 
01:37:28.590 --> 01:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
my comment would be that air traffic
 
01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
control I worked in that for many years
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
both as one and trying to automate one
 
01:37:36.669 --> 01:37:36.679 align:start position:0%
they've been trying to automate it for
 
01:37:36.679 --> 01:37:37.910 align:start position:0%
they've been trying to automate it for
since

01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:37:41.470 --> 01:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
1985 and the thing is the human is still
 
01:37:43.950 --> 01:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
responsible for separating the aircraft
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
no matter what they are using to
 
01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
separate the aircraft so the
 
01:37:50.430 --> 01:37:50.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility in my opinion comes back
 
01:37:51.870 --> 01:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
to the owner
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
when they activate or use that and
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
they're the ones responsible for doing
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you for sharing
 
01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
that I I I agree it goes back to
 
01:38:04.669 --> 01:38:04.679 align:start position:0%
Theology of the prime mover whoever set
 
01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
it in motion is the one who is
 
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
responsible representative of
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
scitec it sounds like your opposition is
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
or your your position is not yet on this
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
bill that's a that's well said sir uh I
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
I have yet spoken the yet to speak the
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
word premature but the the division
 
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
would would see this as
 
01:38:30.189 --> 01:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
that see no further questions thank you
 
01:38:31.790 --> 01:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
for your testimony is there anyone else
 
01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
wishing to testify in this bill who has
 
01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
not yet testified seeing none I hearby
 
01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
left yeah we're behind 10 minutes I open
 
01:38:48.990 --> 01:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on HB
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
1237 and we're going to take a 15minute
 
01:38:51.920 --> 01:39:20.030 align:start position:0%
1237 and we're going to take a 15minute
bar

01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.040 --> 01:53:41.350 align:start position:0%
 
break

01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
at this point I'm opening a public
 
01:53:44.510 --> 01:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
hearing on hit
 
01:53:47.310 --> 01:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
1237 uh a little departure from normal
 
01:53:50.229 --> 01:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
um a house bill 1237 1238 very closely
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
related the sponsors requested to speak
 
01:53:53.910 --> 01:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
to them both at the same time so I'm
 
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
going to let him introduce them both at
 
01:53:57.069 --> 01:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
the same time so keep in mind we're
 
01:53:58.750 --> 01:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
talking about both bills in the interest
 
01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
of time thank you go ahead all right
 
01:54:03.950 --> 01:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
thank you to to the uh the chairman of
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
the committee and and the the members of
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:09.510 align:start position:0%
the committee
I'm

01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:54:13.149 --> 01:54:13.159 align:start position:0%
um pardon me Brandon finny straford 9
 
01:54:16.109 --> 01:54:16.119 align:start position:0%
which is Rochester Ward 6 I'm here to
 
01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
introduce uh hb1 1237 NH hb12 38 which
 
01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:23.800 align:start position:0%
are um about unmarked police vehicles
 
01:54:27.310 --> 01:54:27.320 align:start position:0%
and applying Municipal Police plates to
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
said police vehicles um I want to keep
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
it as concise as I can in and you know
 
01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
on the interest of time and your
 
01:54:36.910 --> 01:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
attention um I want to harp on a couple
 
01:54:39.709 --> 01:54:39.719 align:start position:0%
of things um so essentially what these
 
01:54:41.950 --> 01:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
bills are pertaining to is only
 
01:54:43.390 --> 01:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
Municipal police departments I've
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
excluded the State Police from the scope
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
of the bills um to allow them more more
 
01:54:49.709 --> 01:54:49.719 align:start position:0%
flexibility in their operations so I'm
 
01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
only talking about Municipal um local
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%
police departments who would conduct any
 
01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
type of traffic enforcement um
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
only um you know speeding um stop lights
 
01:55:02.470 --> 01:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
that you know that kind of thing we're
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
not talking about undercover
 
01:55:06.910 --> 01:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
investigations or any or any other type
 
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
of criminal um investigations it's only
 
01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
about uh the enforcement of of um
 
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle St uh
 
01:55:18.030 --> 01:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
statutes um so the first thing I want to
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
I want to harp on is uh the idea of
 
01:55:20.639 --> 01:55:21.510 align:start position:0%
I want to harp on is uh the idea of
Public

01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
Public
 
01:55:24.189 --> 01:55:24.199 align:start position:0%
Safety um currently the way that the
 
01:55:28.750 --> 01:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
police operates um based on a 2005
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
01:55:36.270 --> 01:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
uh Castle Rock against uh uh Gonzalez um
 
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
this the the institution of policing is
 
01:55:41.229 --> 01:55:41.239 align:start position:0%
not under any type of constitutional
 
01:55:45.310 --> 01:55:45.320 align:start position:0%
requirement to um um protect or serve
 
01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
which is what we've all come to
 
01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
understand what what what the role of
 
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
police in our society is to do
 
01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
um in that case their tactics have
 
01:55:55.750 --> 01:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
changed as far as how they enforce the
 
01:55:58.390 --> 01:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
law on the road and also how they tend
 
01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
to generate some revenue for the state
 
01:56:05.790 --> 01:56:05.800 align:start position:0%
um and the idea of not allowing unmarked
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
police vehicles for the sake of of um
 
01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
enforcing uh traffic laws and also uh
 
01:56:15.589 --> 01:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
having the uh requirement to have
 
01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
Municipal Police plates on the vehicle
 
01:56:20.270 --> 01:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
is so that everyone on thead can clearly
 
01:56:23.189 --> 01:56:23.199 align:start position:0%
see that that there is an officer on the
 
01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
road who's conducting speed trap um
 
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
speed trap operations either um on the
 
01:56:31.709 --> 01:56:31.719 align:start position:0%
public road even on some sections of
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
Highway um the the the goal here is to
 
01:56:37.229 --> 01:56:37.239 align:start position:0%
make sure that all the vehicles that
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
that are on the road that are used to
 
01:56:41.149 --> 01:56:41.159 align:start position:0%
pull people over for you know for
 
01:56:45.149 --> 01:56:45.159 align:start position:0%
infractions um have police on the
 
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle that we can see what department
 
01:56:50.069 --> 01:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
it's from that it is um
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
you you know I'm an official Public
 
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
Service vehicle um this this the stealth
 
01:56:58.629 --> 01:56:58.639 align:start position:0%
vehicles that don't have plates on them
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
we don't always know if they're police
 
01:57:03.229 --> 01:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
officers or not and while uh there are a
 
01:57:04.629 --> 01:57:04.639 align:start position:0%
lot of policies from departments in New
 
01:57:06.030 --> 01:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and outside of New
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that require officers to State
 
01:57:09.870 --> 01:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
who they are um who they are and where
 
01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
they're from U it doesn't stop people
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
from personing police officers that's
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
what we want to avoid here um
 
01:57:20.069 --> 01:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
another um aspect of this for
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
accountability um you know we want our
 
01:57:23.790 --> 01:57:23.800 align:start position:0%
police officers to conduct themselves
 
01:57:25.870 --> 01:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
you know professionally and also to
 
01:57:28.189 --> 01:57:28.199 align:start position:0%
respect the rights of people um in their
 
01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle on the road um their rights are
 
01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:31.390 align:start position:0%
vehicle on the road um their rights are
always

01:57:31.390 --> 01:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
always
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
Paramount so we want to we want to have
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
accountability for for police officers
 
01:57:37.069 --> 01:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
that that go a little above and beyond
 
01:57:38.189 --> 01:57:38.199 align:start position:0%
with how they enforce some of the
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
traffic laws and and um a large issue
 
01:57:44.109 --> 01:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
that I think a lot of you have seen is
 
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
is um you know some departments Who hide
 
01:57:49.470 --> 01:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of their you know their vehicles
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
off the road you can't see them from the
 
01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
road they don't have any
 
01:57:55.149 --> 01:57:55.159 align:start position:0%
reflective um like you know you know the
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
lettering and emblems on the side of it
 
01:57:58.709 --> 01:57:58.719 align:start position:0%
so you don't see it's there you got to
 
01:58:02.350 --> 01:58:02.360 align:start position:0%
give um people a time to comply if they
 
01:58:04.709 --> 01:58:04.719 align:start position:0%
see a police officer they can slow down
 
01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
or or if uh you know they were going to
 
01:58:09.149 --> 01:58:09.159 align:start position:0%
run a yellow light that that may have
 
01:58:10.990 --> 01:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
turned red they would stop because
 
01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
they'd see a police officer and that
 
01:58:14.470 --> 01:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
would you know that might um actually
 
01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
prevent a fatal accident which um I
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
don't know if you guys have have seen
 
01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
but the rates of traffic accidents um
 
01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:23.639 align:start position:0%
and fatalities in New Hampshire has gone
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
up it's gone up significantly it's not
 
01:58:28.510 --> 01:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
just based on this issue um there's a
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
whole host of issues as to why um we've
 
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
are are having more traffic um accidents
 
01:58:37.229 --> 01:58:37.239 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but um the the goal
 
01:58:38.550 --> 01:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
here is to make sure that everyone's
 
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
complying on the road with the
 
01:58:44.589 --> 01:58:44.599 align:start position:0%
established you know um uh road laws
 
01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
pardon me for my uh speech impediment um
 
01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
one one main issue that I that I'd like
 
01:58:52.669 --> 01:58:52.679 align:start position:0%
to harp on is that we still have civil
 
01:58:55.550 --> 01:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
asset civil asset for forfeiture in New
 
01:58:57.030 --> 01:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which would allow police
 
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
departments to seize and then repurpose
 
01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
um whatever they get from people to then
 
01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
use on the road to to to stop people
 
01:59:06.270 --> 01:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
with and I think that is a practice in
 
01:59:08.189 --> 01:59:08.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that we should not allow U
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
I think every officer who would conduct
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
those operations on the road should be
 
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
clearly marked and and and and um and
 
01:59:18.030 --> 01:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
identified so that we trust that the
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
person that that we're interacting with
 
01:59:21.390 --> 01:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
is who they say that they
 
01:59:25.870 --> 01:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
are um and that we don't run into any
 
01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:31.750 align:start position:0%
are um and that we don't run into any
escalation

01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:35.310 --> 01:59:35.320 align:start position:0%
um so that's the the the section on the
 
01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
vehicles on themselves
 
01:59:40.990 --> 01:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
um I made the date for after the next
 
01:59:43.470 --> 01:59:43.480 align:start position:0%
year um so that any Department in New
 
01:59:45.470 --> 01:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that would have an
 
01:59:48.030 --> 01:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
unmarked um an unmarked vehicle that
 
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
they would use to to enforce uh Road
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
road traffic laws um to you know the
 
01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
ability to to be you know be ready with
 
01:59:58.510 --> 01:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
either funding or to get rid of the
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle that they would not be able to
 
02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
use if if you know if this bill was to
 
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
go through and that they would also be
 
02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
in compliance with the statute um I I
 
02:00:10.589 --> 02:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
made the additional bill um to have
 
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
Municipal Police uh plates on the
 
02:00:15.629 --> 02:00:15.639 align:start position:0%
vehicle in case this bill did not pass
 
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
we would still have a fail save to at
 
02:00:20.109 --> 02:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
least have an identifying Mark and any
 
02:00:23.069 --> 02:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
of the the the department vehicles that
 
02:00:24.430 --> 02:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
you know that they would then use on the
 
02:00:26.430 --> 02:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
road we we all know what the state
 
02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
police vehicles look like even if
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're not marked we see how they're
 
02:00:32.189 --> 02:00:32.199 align:start position:0%
how they're fixed we can see the the
 
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
state police plates on them but not a
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
lot of local police departments have
 
02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
that requirement or or policy um built
 
02:00:42.510 --> 02:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
in and and they use that for various um
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh stealth practices that that I
 
02:00:47.910 --> 02:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
think uh could be in violation of the
 
02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
um the last thing I wanted to bring up
 
02:00:57.470 --> 02:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
is that I think that if we were um to
 
02:00:59.470 --> 02:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
codify in the statute that all all
 
02:01:01.149 --> 02:01:01.159 align:start position:0%
Municipal police departments must be
 
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
clearly marked that that would Foster
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
more trust um in the in the institution
 
02:01:08.910 --> 02:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
of of policing in New Hampshire where we
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
may not see a lot of the problems that a
 
02:01:12.669 --> 02:01:12.679 align:start position:0%
lot of the bigger states do but but we
 
02:01:14.189 --> 02:01:14.199 align:start position:0%
can at least say in New Hampshire that
 
02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
that that we do uh respect you know the
 
02:01:19.550 --> 02:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
rights and privacy of people um to to
 
02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
you know to travel without being
 
02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
harassed and um you know to also travel
 
02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
and and have the the the the knowledge
 
02:01:29.310 --> 02:01:29.320 align:start position:0%
that uh that they're going to be pulled
 
02:01:31.629 --> 02:01:31.639 align:start position:0%
over by somebody who has a flashing blue
 
02:01:33.669 --> 02:01:33.679 align:start position:0%
light on their vehicle that they are who
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
they say that they are um anybody can
 
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
buy a
 
02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
surplus um or otherwise uh de uh
 
02:01:43.149 --> 02:01:43.159 align:start position:0%
decommissioned you know uh police
 
02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle through auction or just you know
 
02:01:47.910 --> 02:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
from a local uh Used Car Sale place and
 
02:01:51.229 --> 02:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
that person doesn't have the the um
 
02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
illegality of being able to buy uh buy
 
02:01:56.430 --> 02:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
certain types of equipment that that
 
02:01:59.310 --> 02:01:59.320 align:start position:0%
they could then put on their vehicle and
 
02:02:01.750 --> 02:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
illegally harass people on the road as a
 
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
non-p police officer so it's you know
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
accountability for those people uh where
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's already illegal to personate a
 
02:02:09.790 --> 02:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
police officers so we' be able to easily
 
02:02:11.229 --> 02:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
convict that person but also more
 
02:02:13.870 --> 02:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
accountability for the police um that we
 
02:02:16.510 --> 02:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
can clearly see who they are um that
 
02:02:19.390 --> 02:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
that they identify with uh the the
 
02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
department that's hiring them to conduct
 
02:02:23.310 --> 02:02:23.320 align:start position:0%
those operations but I also want to
 
02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
stress again that these two bills don't
 
02:02:28.830 --> 02:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
have anything to do um with operations
 
02:02:32.910 --> 02:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
that are outside of enforcing road laws
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
so that if if any police officer was to
 
02:02:38.310 --> 02:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
come up here to oppose the bill um
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
special um like U
 
02:02:45.550 --> 02:02:45.560 align:start position:0%
um special investigations are not in the
 
02:02:47.390 --> 02:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
scope of the bill it's only what you see
 
02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
out on the road so
 
02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
um that being said I'll take any
 
02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I'm looking at the
 
02:02:59.069 --> 02:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
license plate bill um
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
first each Municipal Police Department
 
02:03:03.550 --> 02:03:03.560 align:start position:0%
shall fix M Municipal Police license
 
02:03:06.069 --> 02:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
plates on Department owned Vehicles no
 
02:03:08.109 --> 02:03:08.119 align:start position:0%
officer shall use any vehicle that does
 
02:03:10.510 --> 02:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
not bear Municipal Police license plates
 
02:03:13.069 --> 02:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
for the performance of official duties
 
02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
that does not limit it to traffic so for
 
02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
Undercover purposes often times police
 
02:03:24.350 --> 02:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
will use a a a normal license plate um
 
02:03:25.870 --> 02:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
and often times if you run that plate it
 
02:03:29.709 --> 02:03:29.719 align:start position:0%
comes back to nobody because
 
02:03:31.750 --> 02:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes especially when you get into
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
higher level drug investigations the
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
cartels and people actually have people
 
02:03:38.189 --> 02:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
that work in dispatch and things like
 
02:03:39.709 --> 02:03:39.719 align:start position:0%
that will run plates for for those
 
02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
people so that the plate comes back to
 
02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
no one is it your intent that this
 
02:03:45.910 --> 02:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
should only limit traffic to traffic
 
02:03:48.030 --> 02:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement for the plates or for all
 
02:03:50.350 --> 02:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
the Municipal Police Vehicles ideally it
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
would be for traffic only um but I do
 
02:03:56.109 --> 02:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
think philosophically that if a police
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
department would would would buy a
 
02:03:59.149 --> 02:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
vehicle for any type of operation
 
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's for special investigations
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
or otherwise that the vehicle should be
 
02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
identified as
 
02:04:07.870 --> 02:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
such even under cover
 
02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639 align:start position:0%
operations and well in that case no but
 
02:04:13.549 --> 02:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
but the scope is for traffic okay gotcha
 
02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
02:04:18.430 --> 02:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
Newell thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:04:21.790 --> 02:04:21.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I actually
 
02:04:23.669 --> 02:04:23.679 align:start position:0%
have an experience with uh being pulled
 
02:04:25.950 --> 02:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
over by someone who I am still not sure
 
02:04:27.390 --> 02:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
if they were actually a police officer
 
02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
on a desolate Montana highway uh and had
 
02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
to pay for a ticket immediately um right
 
02:04:35.790 --> 02:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
there they're going to I don't know I
 
02:04:37.870 --> 02:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
still don't know if this is um a real
 
02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
police officer or not but um anyway
 
02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
fortunately that was not in this state
 
02:04:43.629 --> 02:04:43.639 align:start position:0%
but I understand what it's like to be
 
02:04:46.109 --> 02:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
pulled over and wonder um so this bill
 
02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
seems seems pretty um good for for uh
 
02:04:50.830 --> 02:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
addressing that in that moment so my
 
02:04:52.709 --> 02:04:52.719 align:start position:0%
question to you is sorry it's taking me
 
02:04:55.189 --> 02:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
a bit to get there the question is um
 
02:04:57.270 --> 02:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
would there be uh the important part
 
02:04:59.950 --> 02:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
about that for from my perspective would
 
02:05:02.229 --> 02:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
be so that people understand and can
 
02:05:03.669 --> 02:05:03.679 align:start position:0%
identify themselves if they're being
 
02:05:05.830 --> 02:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
pulled over whether this is um actually
 
02:05:07.709 --> 02:05:07.719 align:start position:0%
a police officer or not and so my
 
02:05:10.270 --> 02:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
question is would this be accompanied by
 
02:05:13.390 --> 02:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
um education for people uh particularly
 
02:05:15.870 --> 02:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
people who may uh likely be V uh
 
02:05:18.270 --> 02:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
victimized or targeted such as uh a
 
02:05:20.549 --> 02:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
single driving down the street at a
 
02:05:23.109 --> 02:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
desolate Highway in Montana absolutely I
 
02:05:24.510 --> 02:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
think more more people in the public
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
should be aware um not only of of the
 
02:05:30.030 --> 02:05:30.040 align:start position:0%
traffic laws but also um some department
 
02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
policies they should be in tune with
 
02:05:34.589 --> 02:05:34.599 align:start position:0%
what the policy um or what their you
 
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
know department is doing with with the
 
02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
powers that they have um and in that
 
02:05:44.109 --> 02:05:44.119 align:start position:0%
instance um you know I I totally
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
sympathize with the the plight of a lot
 
02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
of the women um who
 
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know would encounter that because we
 
02:05:53.390 --> 02:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
we've seen in the news of assaults and
 
02:05:55.510 --> 02:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
you know know those robberies and stuff
 
02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
that had taken place while by a police
 
02:06:00.669 --> 02:06:00.679 align:start position:0%
officer or not um that this is just one
 
02:06:05.470 --> 02:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
part of some uh uh uh reform that that I
 
02:06:08.350 --> 02:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
figured would would be easily you know
 
02:06:10.549 --> 02:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
easily amendable to to even a lot of the
 
02:06:12.149 --> 02:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
more staunch police departments that say
 
02:06:14.709 --> 02:06:14.719 align:start position:0%
like well you know we should identify we
 
02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
should be clearly marked so people can
 
02:06:19.149 --> 02:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
you know can see who we are and you know
 
02:06:20.709 --> 02:06:20.719 align:start position:0%
you know so that we can place our TR you
 
02:06:20.719 --> 02:06:21.589 align:start position:0%
you know so that we can place our TR you
know

02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:06:25.549 --> 02:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
our we can place our trust in them
 
02:06:29.549 --> 02:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
again thank you representative s thank
 
02:06:32.790 --> 02:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
you um my question is related I think to
 
02:06:36.310 --> 02:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
Chairman Roy um so with the license
 
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
plates and the mandatory marking of
 
02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal vehicles I think about our
 
02:06:42.669 --> 02:06:42.679 align:start position:0%
detectives who often need to be in
 
02:06:44.350 --> 02:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
surveillance vehicles that don't have
 
02:06:46.589 --> 02:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
marking specifically for the purposes of
 
02:06:48.629 --> 02:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
doing appropriate detective work and
 
02:06:51.870 --> 02:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
safety work but they also if
 
02:06:54.109 --> 02:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
they're not in the process or maybe even
 
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
while they're in the process of doing
 
02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:56.990 align:start position:0%
while they're in the process of doing
their

02:06:56.990 --> 02:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:06:59.109 --> 02:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
detectiving whatever the terminology
 
02:07:02.109 --> 02:07:02.119 align:start position:0%
would be for that um if they see for
 
02:07:03.870 --> 02:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
example someone who is driving who
 
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
appears obviously impaired um or perhaps
 
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
someone driving down Main Street and
 
02:07:11.830 --> 02:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
Durham going 100 miles an hour on a 25 M
 
02:07:14.629 --> 02:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
hour Zone they have the ability to then
 
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
stop that vehicle because it's a safety
 
02:07:18.229 --> 02:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
issue right and and appropriate for them
 
02:07:18.239 --> 02:07:19.109 align:start position:0%
issue right and and appropriate for them
to

02:07:19.109 --> 02:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
make that determination and I'm sure
 
02:07:23.910 --> 02:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
Chief Dean can attest to that as well
 
02:07:26.430 --> 02:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
but so this requiring them to have
 
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal Vehicles would make it so they
 
02:07:29.629 --> 02:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do their detective
 
02:07:32.589 --> 02:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
work and with I'm trying to figure out
 
02:07:34.350 --> 02:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
how to make it work and so perhaps you
 
02:07:36.149 --> 02:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
have an idea of how they can maintain
 
02:07:38.270 --> 02:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
their need to be in an undercover
 
02:07:41.149 --> 02:07:41.159 align:start position:0%
surveillance mode while also having a
 
02:07:43.109 --> 02:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
municipal license plate that identifies
 
02:07:44.830 --> 02:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
them as a police officer which would
 
02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
negate their ability to be in
 
02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
surveillance I don't think in every
 
02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
instance a detective has to be
 
02:07:54.030 --> 02:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
undercover for them to perform what you
 
02:07:55.629 --> 02:07:55.639 align:start position:0%
know whatever um operations on their
 
02:07:58.549 --> 02:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
case that that they need to do um I was
 
02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
more thinking of of actual um you know
 
02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
the the the U patrol cars that we see
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
every day um obviously like I know that
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
we have to have undercover operations
 
02:08:11.470 --> 02:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
for you know you know for certain types
 
02:08:14.069 --> 02:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
of cases um I did read that there are
 
02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.079 align:start position:0%
some states that um do allow you know
 
02:08:20.069 --> 02:08:20.079 align:start position:0%
the the pulling over uh with an unmarked
 
02:08:23.350 --> 02:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
police U police vehicle but they're also
 
02:08:25.589 --> 02:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
required to call for a you know a
 
02:08:29.310 --> 02:08:29.320 align:start position:0%
uniformed um patrol unit to come um um
 
02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
assist with that stop I I I think with
 
02:08:34.229 --> 02:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
with how small some of our departments
 
02:08:36.229 --> 02:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
are how small some of our towns are I
 
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
don't think it's it would be out of the
 
02:08:39.589 --> 02:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
ordinary for you know for them to to do
 
02:08:43.390 --> 02:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
to representative
 
02:08:47.549 --> 02:08:47.559 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
if this bill was to pass wouldn't we be
 
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
impeding on local control each
 
02:08:55.350 --> 02:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
municipality obviously has a governing
 
02:08:57.149 --> 02:08:57.159 align:start position:0%
body that sets a budget and allows for
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles to be purchased and by doing
 
02:09:01.109 --> 02:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
that it gives the discretion to the
 
02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
local agency if they want to have what
 
02:09:04.510 --> 02:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
type of vehicles they want to have and
 
02:09:06.270 --> 02:09:06.280 align:start position:0%
what kind of use they want to do and as
 
02:09:08.549 --> 02:09:08.559 align:start position:0%
well as establishing their own policies
 
02:09:09.870 --> 02:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
do you feel that we'd be kind of
 
02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
treading on that if uh we were to pass
 
02:09:13.629 --> 02:09:13.639 align:start position:0%
something like this and limiting their
 
02:09:15.069 --> 02:09:15.079 align:start position:0%
control on what they can purchase and
 
02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
how they can utilize it since each
 
02:09:18.549 --> 02:09:18.559 align:start position:0%
municipality is uniquely different
 
02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
whether you're in clamont Manchester or
 
02:09:23.549 --> 02:09:23.559 align:start position:0%
ctie or in your own Hometown um I think
 
02:09:25.470 --> 02:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
in the case where police departments are
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
receiving um you know taxpayer funded
 
02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
items or equipment um there should be
 
02:09:33.310 --> 02:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
accountability from the state as well I
 
02:09:35.229 --> 02:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying um but
 
02:09:36.790 --> 02:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not seeing that kind of
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
accountability on the local um you know
 
02:09:42.109 --> 02:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
like on the level where they would um
 
02:09:45.830 --> 02:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
voluntarily be willing to um be clearly
 
02:09:47.790 --> 02:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
marked and you know you know identified
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
for the public they they would choose to
 
02:09:51.390 --> 02:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
rather hide on you know on the side of
 
02:09:53.470 --> 02:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
the road and not give people time to
 
02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
comply with whatever they're that that
 
02:09:58.229 --> 02:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
that that they be stopping for um I
 
02:10:01.229 --> 02:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
believe that we have the right in the
 
02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
purview to um keep our police our you
 
02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
know police departments accountable also
 
02:10:09.229 --> 02:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
with with the state but not just with
 
02:10:09.239 --> 02:10:11.870 align:start position:0%
with with the state but not just with
the

02:10:11.870 --> 02:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:14.709 --> 02:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so basically this bill aims at
 
02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh a slang called a road pirate is
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
trying to you know C of that type of
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
behavior is what the bill is intended
 
02:10:22.189 --> 02:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
for essentially yes thank
 
02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
you represent chairman again Mr chairman
 
02:10:27.270 --> 02:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question it's
 
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
actually twofold so I'll probably ask
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
for a
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
followup uh on both bills I've noticed
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
that you are using the verbiage of any
 
02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
Municipal police vehicle now to me that
 
02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
means a local police department which in
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
essence is that you're you're
 
02:10:52.669 --> 02:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
intent in your bills to exempt the state
 
02:10:55.790 --> 02:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
police the sheriff and his deputies
 
02:10:57.709 --> 02:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
constables fish and game and liquor
 
02:10:59.310 --> 02:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement I mentioned that in the
 
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
beginning um that I didn't include the
 
02:11:03.910 --> 02:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
the State Police in this purview um you
 
02:11:06.189 --> 02:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
know for that purpose that they um some
 
02:11:08.830 --> 02:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
of their Highway operations require some
 
02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
you know some of their practices but um
 
02:11:12.790 --> 02:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
I didn't include the state police on
 
02:11:14.790 --> 02:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
purpose and to
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
followup um also uh this specifically to
 
02:11:21.030 --> 02:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:11:23.830 --> 02:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
1238 where you are saying that if they
 
02:11:25.229 --> 02:11:25.239 align:start position:0%
don't have a municipal license plate
 
02:11:27.709 --> 02:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
they cannot be used for police
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
purposes that would basically prohibit a
 
02:11:33.270 --> 02:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
police officer who is operating on
 
02:11:35.709 --> 02:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
traffic enforcement detail to not use
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
his personally owned vehicle is that
 
02:11:44.069 --> 02:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:47.669 --> 02:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
you no I don't I I don't know that
 
02:11:48.669 --> 02:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
that's what you mean
 
02:11:51.470 --> 02:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
mean if a if a traffic if an officer is
 
02:11:53.709 --> 02:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
doing a detail he's he's just there
 
02:11:55.629 --> 02:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
standing outside you know uh directing
 
02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
traffic and he's brought his own vehicle
 
02:12:00.549 --> 02:12:00.559 align:start position:0%
um he's not you don't intend that he
 
02:12:02.189 --> 02:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
can't bring his own vehicle to the
 
02:12:03.750 --> 02:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
detail is that what you're saying I'm
 
02:12:05.189 --> 02:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
saying that he should be in a clearly
 
02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:13.350 --> 02:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
okay um who's left
 
02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:15.510 align:start position:0%
okay um who's left
am

02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
am
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you and thank you for taking
 
02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
a question and this has going to piggy
 
02:12:21.229 --> 02:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
back on representative janin so this
 
02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
does not apply to Sheriff's Vehicles
 
02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
constables fishing game as well correct
 
02:12:29.310 --> 02:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
just local police okay correct thank you
 
02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
y representative Pratt sure do you
 
02:12:34.069 --> 02:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
believe there's a value for police
 
02:12:35.589 --> 02:12:35.599 align:start position:0%
presence and visibility in a community
 
02:12:37.390 --> 02:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
to deter
 
02:12:39.790 --> 02:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
crime I'm sorry say it again do you
 
02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
believe there is a value for police
 
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
presence and visibility in a community
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
to deter a crime
 
02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:49.750 align:start position:0%
to deter a crime
100%

02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
100%
 
02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
represent wheeler thank you Mr chairman
 
02:12:53.430 --> 02:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question do you
 
02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
believe that sorry are there any states
 
02:12:59.270 --> 02:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
that have prohibited uh unmarked
 
02:13:01.750 --> 02:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles from being used in traffic law
 
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement and as a second part to that
 
02:13:04.870 --> 02:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
question do you think that there would
 
02:13:07.750 --> 02:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
be any instance in which uh unmarked
 
02:13:10.950 --> 02:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
Vehicles would be good to use in in
 
02:13:12.270 --> 02:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
traffic law
 
02:13:15.310 --> 02:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement um good to
 
02:13:19.149 --> 02:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
use in my view no um I don't but there
 
02:13:21.189 --> 02:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
are not that many states know that have
 
02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
um outlawed a prohibited um I'm I'm I'm
 
02:13:27.069 --> 02:13:27.079 align:start position:0%
just like in its entirety there they
 
02:13:28.390 --> 02:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
have some you know some some
 
02:13:30.030 --> 02:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
stipulations there where where they
 
02:13:32.189 --> 02:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
could still do that but you know there's
 
02:13:34.669 --> 02:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
always like you know you can do this but
 
02:13:36.510 --> 02:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
um and there and there are some states
 
02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
like here in New Hampshire we don't have
 
02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
any you know stipulations on on how
 
02:13:42.790 --> 02:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
they're able to conduct their on
 
02:13:46.350 --> 02:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
laws what would those other states be
 
02:13:52.790 --> 02:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
that have not full prohibitions but like
 
02:13:55.069 --> 02:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
you said sort of half you can do this
 
02:13:56.430 --> 02:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
plan you know I should have that
 
02:13:58.350 --> 02:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
information I I apologize for not having
 
02:13:59.830 --> 02:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
that up top of my head I but I but I can
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
get that to you thank you
 
02:14:04.149 --> 02:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
yeah see no further questions thank you
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:20.709 align:start position:0%
 
guys

02:14:20.709 --> 02:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you ladies and gentlemen I'll be
 
02:14:24.069 --> 02:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
brief uh appreciate the car out for the
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Police in this
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
especially that given that I drive a an
 
02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
unmarked black charger um with a
 
02:14:33.030 --> 02:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
passenger plate the record for which
 
02:14:34.430 --> 02:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
does come back to the Department of
 
02:14:36.270 --> 02:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
Safety State Police I I'll do my best
 
02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
ma'am to avoid you in the future but uh
 
02:14:40.629 --> 02:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
42 miles uh between my house and
 
02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
headquarters um classified more as a
 
02:14:45.229 --> 02:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
commuter than as a cop these days and
 
02:14:49.229 --> 02:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
yet I I make stops every day I I uh do
 
02:14:51.109 --> 02:14:51.119 align:start position:0%
take pleasure in being the answer to the
 
02:14:53.709 --> 02:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
question where's a cop when you need one
 
02:14:56.750 --> 02:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh at least a handful of times a year uh
 
02:14:59.790 --> 02:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
I would argue that the the goal of the
 
02:15:02.629 --> 02:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
law first is is voluntary compliance
 
02:15:04.510 --> 02:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
whether a cruiser is present and within
 
02:15:08.830 --> 02:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
view is uh in my experience and uh much
 
02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
to my shock in many cases not a material
 
02:15:14.350 --> 02:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
fact in the decision-making process of
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
many a driver um that said
 
02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
accountability is an important thing
 
02:15:20.870 --> 02:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
uniform is an important thing State
 
02:15:22.549 --> 02:15:22.559 align:start position:0%
Police uses our Mark plates when we're
 
02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
out on on patrols uh in an age where a
 
02:15:28.030 --> 02:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
mere 7% of serving police officers some
 
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
10,000 who answered a survey from
 
02:15:34.910 --> 02:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
caliber press uh in 2020 7% said that
 
02:15:37.069 --> 02:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
they would Rec uh recommend law
 
02:15:38.910 --> 02:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement to people within their
 
02:15:40.669 --> 02:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
families people within their spheres of
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
influence as a career um we suffer an
 
02:15:48.549 --> 02:15:48.559 align:start position:0%
unprecedented uh lack of police officers
 
02:15:50.549 --> 02:15:50.559 align:start position:0%
out there and and some of those people
 
02:15:53.310 --> 02:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
are assigned to detective uh assignments
 
02:15:55.069 --> 02:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
and undercover assignments and of course
 
02:15:57.270 --> 02:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
for undercover just makes good sense not
 
02:15:59.790 --> 02:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
to be applicable to them but every
 
02:16:01.990 --> 02:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
holiday you'll see a lot of blue lights
 
02:16:04.030 --> 02:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
out on interstates in particular but
 
02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
small roads as well I come from a rural
 
02:16:08.270 --> 02:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
troop I am the community police I grew
 
02:16:10.350 --> 02:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
up being the the community police in
 
02:16:13.030 --> 02:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
that in that area and uh when I go out
 
02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
on patrol it's in those small areas and
 
02:16:18.270 --> 02:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
so unmarked police cars are utilized by
 
02:16:20.549 --> 02:16:20.559 align:start position:0%
those employees to supplement the patrol
 
02:16:23.229 --> 02:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
numbers and to have effect to to keep
 
02:16:24.790 --> 02:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
the public safe on the days where we
 
02:16:27.390 --> 02:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
expect higher traffic um I'm sure
 
02:16:30.510 --> 02:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
Municipal agencies have uh I know that
 
02:16:33.469 --> 02:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
they do have uh similar situations for
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
themselves and and would support them
 
02:16:37.469 --> 02:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
and their ability still to do that uh
 
02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599 align:start position:0%
with regard to the question sir on what
 
02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
states uh Outlaw or allow the use of
 
02:16:44.230 --> 02:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
unmarked Cruisers uh I'm a son of a
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
state trooper I remember my father
 
02:16:47.230 --> 02:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
talking about um Rhode Island in
 
02:16:48.910 --> 02:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
Connecticut K State Police and I can't
 
02:16:50.589 --> 02:16:50.599 align:start position:0%
remember which of the two was Notorious
 
02:16:52.509 --> 02:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
for actually using private Vehicles it
 
02:16:56.190 --> 02:16:56.200 align:start position:0%
was a Ford F-150 it was a Camaro but um
 
02:16:58.589 --> 02:16:58.599 align:start position:0%
in the case where any unmarked vehicles
 
02:17:01.349 --> 02:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
are used uh and forgive me for not
 
02:17:03.070 --> 02:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
knowing specifically given that my
 
02:17:06.030 --> 02:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
computer just died but uh it was one of
 
02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
the two um allows for the use of
 
02:17:10.309 --> 02:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
unmarked Vehicles provided that the
 
02:17:13.509 --> 02:17:13.519 align:start position:0%
driver is in full uniform um that said I
 
02:17:16.990 --> 02:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
think it's still reasonable um within
 
02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
our state to expect police officers to
 
02:17:21.230 --> 02:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
be able to identify themselves well the
 
02:17:22.549 --> 02:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
use of bodyw War cameras and the
 
02:17:25.309 --> 02:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
proliferation of other um accountability
 
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
measures have all been set to advance um
 
02:17:30.750 --> 02:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
our accountability to the public our our
 
02:17:32.509 --> 02:17:32.519 align:start position:0%
requirement that we conduct ourselves
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
with professionalism no matter what it
 
02:17:36.389 --> 02:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
is that we're driving that's all I'll
 
02:17:39.870 --> 02:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
have goe thank you Mr chairman Captain
 
02:17:41.790 --> 02:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
Dave I just want to apologize I wasn't
 
02:17:44.549 --> 02:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't asking you to hurry up I was
 
02:17:46.030 --> 02:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
being sarcastic and saying can you give
 
02:17:48.110 --> 02:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
us more information on the vehicle and I
 
02:17:49.509 --> 02:17:49.519 align:start position:0%
think that that might have been confused
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
and I apologize if you think I was being
 
02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
disrespectful to I was making a joke
 
02:17:55.070 --> 02:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
actually thank you not at
 
02:17:58.509 --> 02:17:58.519 align:start position:0%
all representative Jamon thank you Mr
 
02:18:02.030 --> 02:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you for taking my
 
02:18:05.030 --> 02:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
question um I'm looking at House Bill
 
02:18:09.070 --> 02:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
1237 which is the one uh that would
 
02:18:12.389 --> 02:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
prohibit them from being used for
 
02:18:15.389 --> 02:18:15.399 align:start position:0%
performing traffic law enforcement could
 
02:18:18.709 --> 02:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
you explain to me if the driving Under
 
02:18:20.230 --> 02:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
the Influence or driving while
 
02:18:24.629 --> 02:18:24.639 align:start position:0%
intoxicated laws are considered La uh
 
02:18:27.309 --> 02:18:27.319 align:start position:0%
traffic traffic law enforcement I would
 
02:18:28.910 --> 02:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
consider them to be so sir because
 
02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
they're within the motor vehicle manual
 
02:18:34.629 --> 02:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
followup so if this bill were to pass as
 
02:18:37.549 --> 02:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
written presently uh a police officer in
 
02:18:40.309 --> 02:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
an unmarked car could not make a motor
 
02:18:44.110 --> 02:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle stop for DWI a suspected DWI is
 
02:18:46.629 --> 02:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
that correct yes sir if if that were the
 
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
interpretation yeah yes you're
 
02:18:55.549 --> 02:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:58.469 --> 02:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
Balden thanks for taking my question um
 
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
are you aware of
 
02:19:03.750 --> 02:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
any studies or in
 
02:19:07.349 --> 02:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
statistics related to whether the
 
02:19:11.070 --> 02:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
visible presence of a marked police car
 
02:19:15.349 --> 02:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
um affects behavior and if you're
 
02:19:18.349 --> 02:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
unaware Do you have a perspective on
 
02:19:20.910 --> 02:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
that absolutely Ma I have uh 22 years of
 
02:19:22.669 --> 02:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
experience of watching people behave
 
02:19:26.110 --> 02:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
exceedingly well uh while my marked
 
02:19:28.629 --> 02:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
Cruiser was within their presence um
 
02:19:30.910 --> 02:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
I've seen it change Behavior markedly
 
02:19:32.669 --> 02:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
instantaneously upon the apparent
 
02:19:34.709 --> 02:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
apprehension of drivers that they're in
 
02:19:35.950 --> 02:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
the presence of a New Hampshire state
 
02:19:40.190 --> 02:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
trooper um and I have seen um just the
 
02:19:43.870 --> 02:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
the slightest and and most brief show of
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
lights for example or the recognition by
 
02:19:47.709 --> 02:19:47.719 align:start position:0%
someone that I've got lights within the
 
02:19:50.190 --> 02:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
the vehicle that I drive now um
 
02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
significantly change Behavior so yes
 
02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:56.990 align:start position:0%
significantly change Behavior so yes
ma'am

02:19:56.990 --> 02:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:59.590 --> 02:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
follow so is it possible that marking
 
02:20:01.630 --> 02:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
more police vehicles that are on the
 
02:20:05.870 --> 02:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
road could reduce instances of criminal
 
02:20:07.110 --> 02:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
Behavior or
 
02:20:09.230 --> 02:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
violations uh there's no question in my
 
02:20:12.830 --> 02:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
mind that um more marked police vehicles
 
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the world would likely have a
 
02:20:19.230 --> 02:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
desirable effect on on driving behavior
 
02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
it would probably help people to drive
 
02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:21.790 align:start position:0%
it would probably help people to drive
more

02:20:21.790 --> 02:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:20:24.429 --> 02:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
safely yes
 
02:20:27.550 --> 02:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
ma'am representative
 
02:20:29.550 --> 02:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
Newman I was going to ask you about the
 
02:20:31.710 --> 02:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
blue lights but your your vehicle does
 
02:20:35.270 --> 02:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
have that um what happens if a police
 
02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
officer if you were just commuting in
 
02:20:38.870 --> 02:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
your own car to work and there was some
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
kind of traffic violations would what
 
02:20:43.990 --> 02:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
happens then do you do anything does
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
that have
 
02:20:46.319 --> 02:20:48.309 align:start position:0%
that have
any

02:20:48.309 --> 02:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:20:51.510 --> 02:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
I don't as a practice um do work in a
 
02:20:53.349 --> 02:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
personal vehicle I have been involved
 
02:20:55.429 --> 02:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
over the course of my career in a
 
02:20:58.550 --> 02:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
handful of enforcement actions in really
 
02:21:00.349 --> 02:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
really dangerous situations that
 
02:21:03.630 --> 02:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
required me to take action even though I
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
was not on duty and not even in in
 
02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
uniform um I don't know if that's
 
02:21:11.349 --> 02:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
responsive enough sir just follow up the
 
02:21:13.590 --> 02:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
policy of the State Police is not for
 
02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
its members to conduct traffic um
 
02:21:18.750 --> 02:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
traffic inter ition while off duty or
 
02:21:21.309 --> 02:21:21.319 align:start position:0%
out of uniform is it it's uh it's
 
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
strongly discouraged sir because it's a
 
02:21:25.630 --> 02:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
it's an invitation to what looks may
 
02:21:27.870 --> 02:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
look more like a road rage incident than
 
02:21:31.469 --> 02:21:31.479 align:start position:0%
a a a law enforcement action thank you
 
02:21:31.479 --> 02:21:33.110 align:start position:0%
a a a law enforcement action thank you
followup

02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
followup
 
02:21:37.030 --> 02:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
represent okay um representative
 
02:21:38.830 --> 02:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
Manion thank you and thank you for
 
02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is going to
 
02:21:42.630 --> 02:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
piggy back off uh representative
 
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
balin's statement a question about
 
02:21:47.830 --> 02:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
marked Vehicles clearly have a more more
 
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
more of an impact on people's behavior
 
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
MH however do you feel that the need for
 
02:21:54.030 --> 02:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
these ghost Vehicles which are still
 
02:21:56.550 --> 02:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
marked however it's subtle still visible
 
02:21:58.830 --> 02:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
when lights hit them and stuff do you
 
02:22:00.150 --> 02:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
feel that there's still a need for that
 
02:22:02.590 --> 02:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
type of enforcement in
 
02:22:05.030 --> 02:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
traffic I do from a traffic safety
 
02:22:07.429 --> 02:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
standpoint I'm actually a fan of
 
02:22:10.830 --> 02:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
unmarked Vehicles provided the other uh
 
02:22:13.950 --> 02:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
aspects of appropriate professional
 
02:22:15.870 --> 02:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
well-marked easily identified law
 
02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers are in place um and
 
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
and to the to the uh representative
 
02:22:23.150 --> 02:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
new's comment uh with regard to having
 
02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
been pulled over by a possible
 
02:22:26.030 --> 02:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
impersonator I can say that the scope of
 
02:22:27.790 --> 02:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
that problem as far as New Hampshire law
 
02:22:29.550 --> 02:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement is concerned to my
 
02:22:31.150 --> 02:22:31.160 align:start position:0%
recollection I can
 
02:22:34.510 --> 02:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
remember two within the last year or so
 
02:22:37.150 --> 02:22:37.160 align:start position:0%
uh both of whom got figured out and uh
 
02:22:39.630 --> 02:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
and snared up relatively quickly so the
 
02:22:42.830 --> 02:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
scope of that is uh not severe to my
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
knowledge in New Hampshire thank God and
 
02:22:51.230 --> 02:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:54.389 --> 02:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
represent Newman I I have a quick
 
02:22:56.190 --> 02:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
question just about in the situation
 
02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
that representative new mentioned what
 
02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
what should a person do when a vehicle
 
02:23:03.910 --> 02:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
comes up behind them on a dark night and
 
02:23:06.429 --> 02:23:06.439 align:start position:0%
when and they have blue lights sir and
 
02:23:08.710 --> 02:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
stops them but there's a concern
 
02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
about what to do in that situation what
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
should a person do in that situation um
 
02:23:14.950 --> 02:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
I'm a parent of five three of whom are
 
02:23:17.110 --> 02:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
young ladies who all drive and uh my
 
02:23:19.950 --> 02:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
instructions to them would be call 911
 
02:23:23.190 --> 02:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
get to a welded area um get to a a
 
02:23:25.510 --> 02:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
public area where there's high traffic
 
02:23:27.710 --> 02:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh go ahead and turn your turn signal on
 
02:23:29.429 --> 02:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't appear to be you know an
 
02:23:32.429 --> 02:23:32.439 align:start position:0%
intention to flee necessarily but have
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
those Protections in place and if the
 
02:23:37.190 --> 02:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
person standing at your window doesn't
 
02:23:39.630 --> 02:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
pass the smell test um can't identify
 
02:23:41.469 --> 02:23:41.479 align:start position:0%
himself show credentials without the
 
02:23:43.590 --> 02:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
window rolled all the way down Etc then
 
02:23:44.910 --> 02:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
you have other decisions to make that
 
02:23:47.910 --> 02:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
would be really terrible follow
 
02:23:49.590 --> 02:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
would you consider telling your daughter
 
02:23:51.910 --> 02:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
to put the flashers on the both the
 
02:23:54.070 --> 02:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
emergency flashes on instead of the turn
 
02:23:56.830 --> 02:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
signal oh I consider it
 
02:23:59.990 --> 02:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
sure well I I appreciate the ask a cop
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
session we are we are running late so um
 
02:24:05.150 --> 02:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
please keep your questions to the bill
 
02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:06.630 align:start position:0%

wheeler very quick Mr chairman thank you
 
02:24:29.070 --> 02:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
how long have unmarked Vehicles been

used in police work this bill uh within
 
02:24:35.990 --> 02:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
the real of detectives decades uh for
 
02:24:38.070 --> 02:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
multi-purpose vehicles within the state
 
02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
police anyway we're approaching 15 years
 
02:24:42.670 --> 02:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
or so about 15 years for traffic stops
 
02:24:44.910 --> 02:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
for unmarked Vehicles yes sir okay thank
 
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:48.000 align:start position:0%

02:24:56.429 --> 02:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:59.190 --> 02:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
axelman hi um Ellie axelman from hookset
 
02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
representing myself um I think on 1237
 
02:25:08.190 --> 02:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
and 1238 um the the main thing I would
 
02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:09.110 align:start position:0%
and 1238 um the the main thing I would
say

02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:25:12.710 --> 02:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
is police using unmarked cars or having
 
02:25:14.190 --> 02:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
license plates that don't denote them as
 
02:25:17.950 --> 02:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
police um for for regular traffic off is
 
02:25:20.309 --> 02:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
is not appropriate it's not a kind of
 
02:25:22.469 --> 02:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
policy that I would want in my state um
 
02:25:24.269 --> 02:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
I think the the few the little bit I
 
02:25:26.030 --> 02:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
heard from the previous gentleman
 
02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
speaking I suppose in opposition to the
 
02:25:31.070 --> 02:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
bill was I caught something about only
 
02:25:33.429 --> 02:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
7% of police officers or their family
 
02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
would recommend the job because the the
 
02:25:37.950 --> 02:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
overall support for them is not very
 
02:25:40.469 --> 02:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
high right now I would say I'm not sure
 
02:25:42.670 --> 02:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
you know what exactly the point of that
 
02:25:44.870 --> 02:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
was I didn't hear the whole uh context
 
02:25:47.469 --> 02:25:47.479 align:start position:0%
but I think that when you're pulled over
 
02:25:49.190 --> 02:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
by an unmarked car or the the
 
02:25:50.990 --> 02:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
black-on-black police like we have in my
 
02:25:52.830 --> 02:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
town where where it's essentially
 
02:25:54.750 --> 02:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
impossible to see the police um that
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
makes people not love police a lot when
 
02:26:00.030 --> 02:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
they're undercover and they pull you
 
02:26:03.309 --> 02:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
over like I was pulled over um at the bo
 
02:26:05.750 --> 02:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
conquered border a few weeks ago by I
 
02:26:08.590 --> 02:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
think uh bo police and he said I noticed
 
02:26:09.710 --> 02:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
as you were driving I saw your
 
02:26:11.389 --> 02:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker was the wrong caller
 
02:26:15.710 --> 02:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
it's from last year um sorry so like so
 
02:26:17.070 --> 02:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
that I I was pulled door for that said
 
02:26:18.269 --> 02:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
hey it just expired it was my birthday
 
02:26:20.269 --> 02:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
I'll get it fixed um so I got a warning
 
02:26:21.790 --> 02:26:21.800 align:start position:0%
but it's stuff like that every time
 
02:26:23.389 --> 02:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
there's a traffic stop I think one of
 
02:26:24.990 --> 02:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
the few things that all the sides agree
 
02:26:28.950 --> 02:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
on right left police anarchists um
 
02:26:31.230 --> 02:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
traffic stops are inherently dangerous
 
02:26:33.910 --> 02:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
for so many reasons people can get hurt
 
02:26:35.150 --> 02:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
um the police officers on the side of
 
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
the road especially on a highway if one
 
02:26:40.030 --> 02:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
driver is texting or coughs or sneezes
 
02:26:42.190 --> 02:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
or looks down and they swerve off one
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
inch they can clip the officer and now
 
02:26:45.990 --> 02:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
we have someone else is dead someone
 
02:26:47.230 --> 02:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
else going to jail so someone else going
 
02:26:49.510 --> 02:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
to jail we have orphans and widows and
 
02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
and he it was one cop pulling over one
 
02:26:53.550 --> 02:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
guy for an inspection sticker and now we
 
02:26:55.349 --> 02:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
have widows and and you know kids
 
02:26:57.950 --> 02:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
without par it's very sad and the risk
 
02:26:59.670 --> 02:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
reward in my opinion is not really worth
 
02:27:02.950 --> 02:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
it someone with uh an expired inspection
 
02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
sticker um you know probably would have
 
02:27:07.790 --> 02:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
survived and and uh now we have people
 
02:27:10.030 --> 02:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
dead so so police officers pulling
 
02:27:11.630 --> 02:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
people over it's dangerous for them it's
 
02:27:14.190 --> 02:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
dangerous for me I I carry 247 if you
 
02:27:16.269 --> 02:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
say the GW the cop you know very often
 
02:27:17.389 --> 02:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
will get a and they'll pull out their
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
gun and maybe kill you so we've seen a
 
02:27:20.950 --> 02:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
lot of those videos too um where
 
02:27:22.750 --> 02:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
anything wrong can happen where if he
 
02:27:23.950 --> 02:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
says wear your hands get your
 
02:27:25.590 --> 02:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
registration move your hand the wrong
 
02:27:27.710 --> 02:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
way people people can get hurt so every
 
02:27:29.349 --> 02:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
traffic stop there's there's inherent
 
02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
risks and everyone agrees on that
 
02:27:33.750 --> 02:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
there's risks to everyone the the driver
 
02:27:35.830 --> 02:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
the police officer other pedestrians
 
02:27:37.550 --> 02:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
drivers and others in the car so if we
 
02:27:39.630 --> 02:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
could I would say eliminate pretty much
 
02:27:41.230 --> 02:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
all traffic stops unless there's a clear
 
02:27:43.349 --> 02:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
and imminent danger of someone swerving
 
02:27:45.950 --> 02:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
or driving 150 something like that
 
02:27:47.710 --> 02:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
routine traffic tops for like very much
 
02:27:50.750 --> 02:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
victimless nonviolent offenses um which
 
02:27:51.710 --> 02:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
happens in New Hampshire cuz New
 
02:27:53.389 --> 02:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is unique in that I don't know
 
02:27:56.230 --> 02:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
if other states have uh uh absolute
 
02:27:58.910 --> 02:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
primary offense so technically every
 
02:28:00.429 --> 02:28:00.439 align:start position:0%
single thing in the universe that's on
 
02:28:02.469 --> 02:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
the inspection list which is like 35,000
 
02:28:04.429 --> 02:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
words is a primary offense so if your
 
02:28:06.590 --> 02:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
tail light the light bulb on your
 
02:28:08.630 --> 02:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
license plate shining on it is not good
 
02:28:10.110 --> 02:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
enough that could be a primary offense
 
02:28:11.469 --> 02:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
and cops could pull you over and you
 
02:28:12.750 --> 02:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
fail inspection and the inspection
 
02:28:14.630 --> 02:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
people tell you they can't pass you if
 
02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
you have any tiny uh even one little
 
02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
frame or one molecule covering your
 
02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
license plate front or back so there are
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of little things that are primary
 
02:28:24.389 --> 02:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
offenses cops can pull you over if you
 
02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
have anything obstructing either front
 
02:28:27.790 --> 02:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
or back license plate that has to be
 
02:28:29.469 --> 02:28:29.479 align:start position:0%
100% clear not one molecule can be
 
02:28:31.309 --> 02:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
blocking it um so it's things like that
 
02:28:33.070 --> 02:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
you can get pulled over a lot and I
 
02:28:36.870 --> 02:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
would say um anytime we can diminish the
 
02:28:38.710 --> 02:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
amount of traffic stops there are we can
 
02:28:42.510 --> 02:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
save so much uh risk to police officers
 
02:28:44.070 --> 02:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
and others and resentment towards
 
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
officers because they pull you over and
 
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know a lot of people who like
 
02:28:49.950 --> 02:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
himer um and and I'm happy to take
 
02:28:51.870 --> 02:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
questions in a second um and and the
 
02:28:53.150 --> 02:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
other thing is the waste of productivity
 
02:28:54.830 --> 02:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
the time is money when I'm pulled over
 
02:28:56.469 --> 02:28:56.479 align:start position:0%
that's the cop who's being paid by by
 
02:28:58.349 --> 02:28:58.359 align:start position:0%
taxes and me sitting on the road for 10
 
02:29:00.429 --> 02:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
20 30 minutes idling my car polluting
 
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
the environment with a collective you
 
02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
know billion tons of CO2 over year um
 
02:29:05.389 --> 02:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
and we're all wasting a lot of time and
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
energy and I'm missing time with my son
 
02:29:08.269 --> 02:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
because I'm on the side of the road
 
02:29:09.790 --> 02:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
talking about inspection stickers so I'm
 
02:29:11.630 --> 02:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
02:29:14.030 --> 02:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
questions rep readed thank you Mr
 
02:29:16.349 --> 02:29:16.359 align:start position:0%
chairman so when your precious Sun grows
 
02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
up and gets his license and has a little
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
bit of testosterone poisoning and just
 
02:29:24.110 --> 02:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
lets it rip you know and wraps himself
 
02:29:26.950 --> 02:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
around a tree I think at one point maybe
 
02:29:29.630 --> 02:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
a traffic stop you would have wanted
 
02:29:32.469 --> 02:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
that traffic stop
 
02:29:35.110 --> 02:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
before Y how do you feel about that yeah
 
02:29:37.309 --> 02:29:37.319 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so um for a bit
 
02:29:39.469 --> 02:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
of background I'm as anti-p speeding and
 
02:29:41.110 --> 02:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
reckless driving as anyone I worked I'm
 
02:29:42.750 --> 02:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
a paramedic I've worked in EMS since
 
02:29:44.870 --> 02:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
2011 so I I've seen the really really
 
02:29:47.750 --> 02:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
bad NBAs and um I'm obviously a
 
02:29:49.790 --> 02:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
proponent of safe driving I've taught
 
02:29:51.030 --> 02:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
safety driving for ambulances and
 
02:29:52.910 --> 02:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
regular cars for a while um and that's
 
02:29:54.349 --> 02:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
why I drive very conservative especially
 
02:29:56.070 --> 02:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
with my in the car I drive very slow and
 
02:29:59.070 --> 02:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
careful um I I would say the one traffic
 
02:30:00.710 --> 02:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
stop that's legitimate Is For Real
 
02:30:02.110 --> 02:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
reckless driving so if you if you were
 
02:30:04.030 --> 02:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
18 and you had testosterone you were
 
02:30:06.349 --> 02:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
driving way too fast or in a way that is
 
02:30:08.830 --> 02:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
reckless and and we already have a crime
 
02:30:10.510 --> 02:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
of reckless driving and any cop that can
 
02:30:12.550 --> 02:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
all tell you it's it's arbitrary any cop
 
02:30:14.110 --> 02:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
can pull anyone over for reckless
 
02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
driving which is you know pretty broad
 
02:30:16.990 --> 02:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
if they think they driving too fast for
 
02:30:18.630 --> 02:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
the conditions or the road regardless of
 
02:30:20.870 --> 02:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
speed limit if they think you're driving
 
02:30:22.309 --> 02:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
if it's raining and you're driving 35
 
02:30:23.670 --> 02:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
into 30 like they can pull you over if
 
02:30:25.870 --> 02:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
you're driving back spe and and I'm I'm
 
02:30:27.429 --> 02:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
not that opposed to that because if
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
you're driving really recklessly like if
 
02:30:32.110 --> 02:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
they say in their affidavit they believe
 
02:30:33.469 --> 02:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
within a minute someone was going to get
 
02:30:34.389 --> 02:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
hurt because you were driving so
 
02:30:36.309 --> 02:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
recklessly they could pull you over but
 
02:30:38.070 --> 02:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
inspection stickers my license plate
 
02:30:39.790 --> 02:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
light bulb that shines my plate not
 
02:30:41.550 --> 02:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
being bright enough or being out or
 
02:30:44.510 --> 02:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
things like that um like I can't support
 
02:30:46.190 --> 02:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
those kinds of traffic laws especially
 
02:30:48.750 --> 02:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
with an unmarked car that's that you
 
02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
can't see so thank you thank you and
 
02:30:53.950 --> 02:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
02:30:53.960 --> 02:30:55.469 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you

much um the chair recognizes The
 
02:31:04.030 --> 02:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:31:08.630 --> 02:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
honorable members it's a pleasure to be

Reed I represent new market and new
 
02:31:19.510 --> 02:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
Fields Rockingham 10 I will speak
 
02:31:22.830 --> 02:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
conceptually on the bill I am aware um
 
02:31:24.309 --> 02:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
that the bill May benefit from
 
02:31:26.750 --> 02:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
amendments including an amendment uh
 
02:31:30.110 --> 02:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
potential amendment to um exclude
 
02:31:32.070 --> 02:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
officers who see Reckless behaviors
 
02:31:34.550 --> 02:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
while performing other duties like
 
02:31:38.910 --> 02:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
undercover detective work um I ask that
 
02:31:41.349 --> 02:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
the committee engage in the good work of
 
02:31:43.349 --> 02:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
taking the matter seriously and working
 
02:31:45.389 --> 02:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
on language that would be suitable for
 
02:31:47.670 --> 02:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
the state um I did want to bring up
 
02:31:49.269 --> 02:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
before I bring up my I have a personal
 
02:31:52.269 --> 02:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
story that only happened a month ago um
 
02:31:53.870 --> 02:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
with regards to being pulled over by an
 
02:31:56.070 --> 02:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
officer uh not in a marked vehicle but
 
02:31:57.630 --> 02:31:57.640 align:start position:0%
before I I give you that story I did
 
02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
want to address a couple things um
 
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative janen brought up the
 
02:32:07.070 --> 02:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
issue of uh local control as a Dylan's
 
02:32:09.710 --> 02:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
rules State we already impede local
 
02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
control pretty severely we actually
 
02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
impede all Municipal decisions unless we
 
02:32:17.750 --> 02:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
actively enable them I actually prefer
 
02:32:20.670 --> 02:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
uh home rule myself but there is a
 
02:32:22.750 --> 02:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
reason even in home rule there is a
 
02:32:24.469 --> 02:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
balance between a higher level of
 
02:32:26.790 --> 02:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
government and a local or more local
 
02:32:28.429 --> 02:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
level level of government and that is
 
02:32:31.230 --> 02:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
because it serves as a check and balance
 
02:32:33.389 --> 02:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
just as it does on the federal level
 
02:32:35.309 --> 02:32:35.319 align:start position:0%
there the larger level of government
 
02:32:37.070 --> 02:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
provides a floor of Rights and then
 
02:32:38.990 --> 02:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
local governments can build up from
 
02:32:41.830 --> 02:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
there but not sync beneath it's the same
 
02:32:44.190 --> 02:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
with State and Municipal so that serves
 
02:32:44.200 --> 02:32:45.110 align:start position:0%
with State and Municipal so that serves
a

02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:32:48.630 --> 02:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
function um um my personal story is
 
02:32:50.469 --> 02:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
about a month ago and I'm not like the
 
02:32:54.070 --> 02:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
previous speaker um I I I drive quickly
 
02:32:56.110 --> 02:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
is is what I will say I have a CDL
 
02:32:58.429 --> 02:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
license I've been CDL licensed for and I
 
02:33:00.190 --> 02:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps the captain should should cover
 
02:33:02.630 --> 02:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
his ears when I'm speaking about my
 
02:33:05.389 --> 02:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
driving but I have a CDL license uh yeah
 
02:33:09.030 --> 02:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
too late indeed um uh I've put nearly a
 
02:33:10.990 --> 02:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
million miles professionally and in
 
02:33:13.990 --> 02:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
large CDL vehicles in addition I am a
 
02:33:16.830 --> 02:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
motorcycle Enthusiast and have
 
02:33:20.429 --> 02:33:20.439 align:start position:0%
um ridden in multiple States Colorado
 
02:33:23.670 --> 02:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
California Florida you name it so um
 
02:33:26.790 --> 02:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
when you put that many miles on you get
 
02:33:28.790 --> 02:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit confident and so I am a
 
02:33:30.790 --> 02:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
fast driver and I was driving pretty
 
02:33:34.269 --> 02:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
quickly um but not recklessly and not
 
02:33:36.670 --> 02:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
you know unreasonably beyond the rest of
 
02:33:38.469 --> 02:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
traffic um on
 
02:33:40.870 --> 02:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
95 and as I was driving I was in the
 
02:33:42.750 --> 02:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
passing Lane as I was driving and I was
 
02:33:45.950 --> 02:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
passing as I was driving I noticed um
 
02:33:47.910 --> 02:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
that someone came up behind me and was
 
02:33:50.309 --> 02:33:50.319 align:start position:0%
tailgating me very very very closely and
 
02:33:52.510 --> 02:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
swerving very aggressively and hosti and
 
02:33:55.630 --> 02:33:55.640 align:start position:0%
my first instinct was to try to gain
 
02:33:58.830 --> 02:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
distance he was that close um and then
 
02:34:01.150 --> 02:34:01.160 align:start position:0%
as I was able to he he stayed right on
 
02:34:02.590 --> 02:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
me but as I was able to gained some
 
02:34:05.750 --> 02:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
distance I noticed despite this glare of
 
02:34:09.230 --> 02:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
the Sun the ever the smallest little
 
02:34:12.349 --> 02:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
blue tint of a flicker in the headlights
 
02:34:14.349 --> 02:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
that had previously been invisible to me
 
02:34:16.750 --> 02:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
because the person was so close behind
 
02:34:19.429 --> 02:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
me that the headlights were not viewable
 
02:34:21.150 --> 02:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
they were underneath my rear windshield
 
02:34:25.150 --> 02:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
view so finally I pulled over all the
 
02:34:28.550 --> 02:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
way and this person in a Bruins uh
 
02:34:31.870 --> 02:34:31.880 align:start position:0%
Jersey came out screaming at me he did
 
02:34:34.590 --> 02:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
not identify himself by name or give me
 
02:34:36.190 --> 02:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
a badge number or show any
 
02:34:38.030 --> 02:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
identification at all he simply said he
 
02:34:40.510 --> 02:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
was a State Trooper by the way this
 
02:34:42.830 --> 02:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
happened in Massachusetts not New
 
02:34:46.269 --> 02:34:46.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and he was extremely
 
02:34:49.790 --> 02:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
hostile with me uh directly yelling at
 
02:34:52.790 --> 02:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
me and he actually said that he was
 
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
about to call um and I don't even know
 
02:34:57.269 --> 02:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
what this is but he was going to call
 
02:35:00.269 --> 02:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
for a pullover bar and if it's what I
 
02:35:02.550 --> 02:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
think it might be it means that he was
 
02:35:05.590 --> 02:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
willing to have my tires punctured and
 
02:35:07.309 --> 02:35:07.319 align:start position:0%
in the middle of rush hour traffic I
 
02:35:08.630 --> 02:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't know it but it was
 
02:35:10.990 --> 02:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
extremely hostile and after he wrote up
 
02:35:14.070 --> 02:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
my citation he threw the ticket into my
 
02:35:17.750 --> 02:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
window so I give you all of this and I
 
02:35:19.710 --> 02:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to suggest that New Hampshire
 
02:35:21.429 --> 02:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
officers are guilty of any of this I've
 
02:35:24.429 --> 02:35:24.439 align:start position:0%
heard no stories to that effect but I
 
02:35:27.150 --> 02:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
give you all of this because of the
 
02:35:29.469 --> 02:35:29.479 align:start position:0%
thought that every occupation attracts a
 
02:35:31.510 --> 02:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
certain personality type if you like
 
02:35:34.469 --> 02:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
kids you might decide to be a teacher if
 
02:35:36.670 --> 02:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
you like helping people maybe you want
 
02:35:39.429 --> 02:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
to go into nursing for for law
 
02:35:41.870 --> 02:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement I hope and I believe that
 
02:35:43.950 --> 02:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
maybe even a majority of Law Enforcement
 
02:35:46.110 --> 02:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
Officers got into it because they truly
 
02:35:48.389 --> 02:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to see Justice Done in the world
 
02:35:51.190 --> 02:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
and help people however if you are also
 
02:35:54.349 --> 02:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
a person who I guess colloquially we
 
02:35:56.070 --> 02:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
call on a power trip and you feel like
 
02:35:58.550 --> 02:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
you need to dominate others those people
 
02:36:00.830 --> 02:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
are also attracted to law enforcement I
 
02:36:03.950 --> 02:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
grew up in Memphis which was the um
 
02:36:07.230 --> 02:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
murder and auto theft capital of the
 
02:36:09.429 --> 02:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
country uh for multiple years as I was
 
02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
growing up and our car was stolen six
 
02:36:14.150 --> 02:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
times as I was growing up police
 
02:36:16.550 --> 02:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
officers in my mind as I was growing up
 
02:36:18.790 --> 02:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
were the good guys so I don't want to
 
02:36:20.910 --> 02:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
say it's every officer but when you have
 
02:36:23.309 --> 02:36:23.319 align:start position:0%
enough people in a department or in a
 
02:36:25.790 --> 02:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
culture they're they're able to affect
 
02:36:29.190 --> 02:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
the culture and my question is how much
 
02:36:32.110 --> 02:36:32.120 align:start position:0%
more for someone who is thinking along
 
02:36:33.670 --> 02:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
those lines who wants to dominate people
 
02:36:36.190 --> 02:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
how much more emboldened are they if
 
02:36:39.150 --> 02:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
they lose the accountability that comes
 
02:36:41.389 --> 02:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
with showing up and I realize that
 
02:36:43.630 --> 02:36:43.640 align:start position:0%
uniforms aren't part of this bill but in
 
02:36:47.790 --> 02:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
uniform and in a marked vehicle
 
02:36:51.150 --> 02:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
go with I think this is a Spider-Man
 
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
quote but with great power comes great
 
02:36:55.670 --> 02:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility and they're really in
 
02:36:57.910 --> 02:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
everyday Society police officers hold
 
02:37:00.830 --> 02:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
the most power so therefore they have to
 
02:37:02.710 --> 02:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
be held to the most responsibility on
 
02:37:05.030 --> 02:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
the previous Bill actually the captain
 
02:37:07.349 --> 02:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
who I only have respect for I want to
 
02:37:11.269 --> 02:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
make that very very clear um said and I
 
02:37:12.590 --> 02:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
I tried to write down the quote as he
 
02:37:13.870 --> 02:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
was saying it that the department would
 
02:37:15.870 --> 02:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
oppose quote anything that removes
 
02:37:18.349 --> 02:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
transparency ownership and culpability
 
02:37:21.630 --> 02:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
but what else is having a marked vehicle
 
02:37:23.230 --> 02:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
than the transparency ownership and
 
02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
culpability of your
 
02:37:27.590 --> 02:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
actions there's two other quick aspects
 
02:37:30.590 --> 02:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
to this I I want to bring up
 
02:37:34.230 --> 02:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
um one is I am a motorcycle Enthusiast
 
02:37:37.070 --> 02:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
and there has historically been some
 
02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
relationship both positive and negative
 
02:37:40.670 --> 02:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
between motorcyclists and the law
 
02:37:43.510 --> 02:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement Community generally Cruiser
 
02:37:45.550 --> 02:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
drivers which I I do ride Cruisers as
 
02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:46.550 align:start position:0%
drivers which I I do ride Cruisers as
well

02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
um are seen favorably sometimes by some
 
02:37:52.230 --> 02:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
police officers generally sport bike
 
02:37:57.630 --> 02:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
drivers Riders are uh not um and I
 
02:37:59.670 --> 02:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
actually sent a video which I'm happy to
 
02:38:02.230 --> 02:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
share with the committee of an an
 
02:38:05.429 --> 02:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
unmarked vehicle officer with in plain
 
02:38:08.870 --> 02:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
clothes um pulling over a motorcyclist
 
02:38:12.309 --> 02:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
on a sport bike um and approaching the
 
02:38:16.429 --> 02:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
rider with gun drawn and aimed and aimed
 
02:38:19.429 --> 02:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
at the writer for no other reason than
 
02:38:22.429 --> 02:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
speeding so I think that speaks to like
 
02:38:25.750 --> 02:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
the mentality of certain officers not
 
02:38:28.590 --> 02:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
all the other thing I want to to speak
 
02:38:30.630 --> 02:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
to is what uh representative nle brought
 
02:38:33.870 --> 02:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
up about the relationship between women
 
02:38:36.830 --> 02:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
who may be alone in their vehicle and
 
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
officers um and this is something I
 
02:38:42.830 --> 02:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
found in 2020 and wanted to do something
 
02:38:45.750 --> 02:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
about it there was an expose a study
 
02:38:48.429 --> 02:38:48.439 align:start position:0%
across the country of uh police officers
 
02:38:51.750 --> 02:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
who engage in police detaining sexual
 
02:38:53.950 --> 02:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
offense this is where police officer
 
02:38:57.510 --> 02:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
picks up somebody typically a woman um
 
02:38:59.590 --> 02:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
cites them for something essentially
 
02:39:02.070 --> 02:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
threatens to arrest them takes them
 
02:39:04.990 --> 02:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
around somewhere dark and and uh tells
 
02:39:07.230 --> 02:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
them to comply or else they will go to
 
02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
jail um it's legal this is legal because
 
02:39:14.230 --> 02:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
there's nothing explicitly making it
 
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
illegal in 35 States at the time I found
 
02:39:20.630 --> 02:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
this out I asked a former officer in New
 
02:39:22.870 --> 02:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if it was legal in this state
 
02:39:25.830 --> 02:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
and the officer told me no I took his
 
02:39:27.990 --> 02:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
word for it in preparation for this
 
02:39:30.710 --> 02:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
testimony I looked it back up it is
 
02:39:32.309 --> 02:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
legal in the state so I'm going to tell
 
02:39:34.750 --> 02:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
you right now I intend to Prime sponsor
 
02:39:36.510 --> 02:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
a bill next year and I welcome any
 
02:39:39.030 --> 02:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors off of this committee um to
 
02:39:42.910 --> 02:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
make it illegal but it is uh legal in 35
 
02:39:47.389 --> 02:39:47.399 align:start position:0%
States for an officer to have sex with a
 
02:39:50.750 --> 02:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
detainee um so long as they claim it's
 
02:39:52.910 --> 02:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
consensual there's a power differential
 
02:39:55.030 --> 02:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
and we have a power differential in much
 
02:39:58.269 --> 02:39:58.279 align:start position:0%
of our sexual assault uh statute um to
 
02:40:00.349 --> 02:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
show that that is an exacerbating
 
02:40:03.070 --> 02:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
influence so I don't think it's okay for
 
02:40:05.030 --> 02:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
a police officer who has power over a
 
02:40:08.349 --> 02:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
detainee to um have sex with them across
 
02:40:10.110 --> 02:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
this country that's getting kind of far
 
02:40:13.309 --> 02:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
off the bill okay my my point in
 
02:40:15.630 --> 02:40:15.640 align:start position:0%
bringing it up and I apologize for that
 
02:40:17.750 --> 02:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
is that with these stories these are
 
02:40:19.590 --> 02:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
police officers in marked vehicles with
 
02:40:21.830 --> 02:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
uniforms they're still doing this and it
 
02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
happens apparently once a week across
 
02:40:27.150 --> 02:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
the country how much more emboldened are
 
02:40:28.750 --> 02:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
they if they are not wearing their
 
02:40:32.190 --> 02:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
uniform and are in a unmarked vehicle is
 
02:40:35.950 --> 02:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
my question so um again I appreciate the
 
02:40:38.870 --> 02:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
committee's time uh but I do think it's
 
02:40:40.190 --> 02:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be taken
 
02:40:41.670 --> 02:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
seriously and I hope the committee will
 
02:40:44.510 --> 02:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
work on it thank
 
02:40:48.670 --> 02:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
you chair calls Chief Paul Dean thanks
 
02:40:55.710 --> 02:40:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:58.510 --> 02:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
any good morning I'll be brief my name
 
02:41:00.269 --> 02:41:00.279 align:start position:0%
is Paul Dean I'm the chief of police for
 
02:41:02.110 --> 02:41:02.120 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire and the
 
02:41:03.550 --> 02:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
third vice president for the New
 
02:41:04.950 --> 02:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Chiefs associate where they
 
02:41:07.309 --> 02:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
have speaking on we're we're speaking
 
02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
we're opposed to this bill I'm not going
 
02:41:10.389 --> 02:41:10.399 align:start position:0%
to go into a lot of the things that have
 
02:41:13.110 --> 02:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
already been said um but I've not heard
 
02:41:15.870 --> 02:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
one example um sitting there of a New
 
02:41:18.750 --> 02:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire officer uh doing doing
 
02:41:20.790 --> 02:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
something it's been all out of state
 
02:41:22.830 --> 02:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
people and I think that's important for
 
02:41:25.429 --> 02:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
the standards that we use to hire law
 
02:41:26.990 --> 02:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers in the state of New
 
02:41:28.990 --> 02:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've been a police officer for
 
02:41:32.510 --> 02:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
39 years and I'm proud of the New
 
02:41:34.950 --> 02:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement profession I'm
 
02:41:36.870 --> 02:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
proud of police students and training
 
02:41:39.269 --> 02:41:39.279 align:start position:0%
where we train all officers whether
 
02:41:41.190 --> 02:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
they're campus police officers state
 
02:41:43.750 --> 02:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
police officers municipal or county
 
02:41:46.349 --> 02:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
offices the same and I know in that
 
02:41:50.030 --> 02:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
training that we are taught how to
 
02:41:52.190 --> 02:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
identify ourselves when we are in pling
 
02:41:54.309 --> 02:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
when we are pling
 
02:41:56.550 --> 02:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
clothes I also want to comment on the
 
02:41:59.429 --> 02:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
issue of asset forfeiture um the
 
02:42:01.990 --> 02:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative spoke about stopping a
 
02:42:04.110 --> 02:42:04.120 align:start position:0%
car potentially seizing it and
 
02:42:07.910 --> 02:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
repurposing it for law enforcement that
 
02:42:10.269 --> 02:42:10.279 align:start position:0%
that's simply not the case I am not
 
02:42:13.349 --> 02:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
aware in my 39 years and I worked
 
02:42:15.030 --> 02:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
undercover for the Attorney General's
 
02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:16.190 align:start position:0%
undercover for the Attorney General's
office

02:42:16.190 --> 02:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:42:19.590 --> 02:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
um for a period of time of we seized
 
02:42:21.670 --> 02:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
cars but we didn't repurpose them for
 
02:42:24.590 --> 02:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
use on the road for traffic enforcement
 
02:42:27.030 --> 02:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
most of the time those were gone to
 
02:42:30.309 --> 02:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
auction and the money returned uh there
 
02:42:32.070 --> 02:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to comment on those
 
02:42:34.070 --> 02:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
those areas there and that's been said
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:41.309 --> 02:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
any Chief with regard to the the points
 
02:42:43.590 --> 02:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
made by the sponsor and subsequent um
 
02:42:45.429 --> 02:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
testimony from other people including
 
02:42:47.429 --> 02:42:47.439 align:start position:0%
and the representative who just
 
02:42:51.429 --> 02:42:51.439 align:start position:0%
testified do you not think that for the
 
02:42:53.670 --> 02:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
purposes of traffic enforcement it is
 
02:42:56.790 --> 02:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
better that our um vehicles used by our
 
02:42:58.510 --> 02:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement are
 
02:43:02.630 --> 02:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
marked yes sir of course uh but I do
 
02:43:05.750 --> 02:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
think that there's opportunities for us
 
02:43:08.750 --> 02:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
to use unmarked vehicles for specific
 
02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement in specific enforcement
 
02:43:13.790 --> 02:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
areas where the unmarked
 
02:43:17.710 --> 02:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle may be deterrent but is not able
 
02:43:21.190 --> 02:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
to stop things that are things that are
 
02:43:24.590 --> 02:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
happening uh in addition to that um I
 
02:43:27.870 --> 02:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
drive an unmarked vehicle I can tell you
 
02:43:29.950 --> 02:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
that I only will stop a vehicle for a
 
02:43:29.960 --> 02:43:31.550 align:start position:0%
that I only will stop a vehicle for a
serious

02:43:31.550 --> 02:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
serious
 
02:43:34.150 --> 02:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
offense and I think that's the vast
 
02:43:36.990 --> 02:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
majority of people who are in unmarked
 
02:43:39.309 --> 02:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are doing their jobs and I
 
02:43:42.150 --> 02:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
want to I want to just take a second to
 
02:43:44.910 --> 02:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
um address um representative selid when
 
02:43:48.510 --> 02:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
she talked talked about in in Durham um
 
02:43:50.429 --> 02:43:50.439 align:start position:0%
we spend a lot of time dealing with
 
02:43:52.910 --> 02:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
underage drinking and the purchasing of
 
02:43:56.110 --> 02:43:56.120 align:start position:0%
of underage drinking and part of that is
 
02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
the transportation of
 
02:43:58.080 --> 02:43:59.670 align:start position:0%
the transportation of
alcohol

02:43:59.670 --> 02:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
02:44:02.309 --> 02:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
and whether you're a liquor enforcement
 
02:44:05.830 --> 02:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
officer in an unmarked car uh or a
 
02:44:07.830 --> 02:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
Durham or university police officer in
 
02:44:10.790 --> 02:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
an unmarked car we do stop vehicles uh
 
02:44:12.510 --> 02:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
for that because we're in an undercover
 
02:44:15.910 --> 02:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
plane close uh manner I would be
 
02:44:19.950 --> 02:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
concerned that a durm or University
 
02:44:23.269 --> 02:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
Police Officer um couldn't stop those
 
02:44:26.190 --> 02:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
cars but a liquor enforcement officer
 
02:44:30.710 --> 02:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
could or a sheriff's department could
 
02:44:33.429 --> 02:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm confident
 
02:44:36.269 --> 02:44:36.279 align:start position:0%
that we can manage these with training
 
02:44:36.279 --> 02:44:37.510 align:start position:0%
that we can manage these with training
and

02:44:37.510 --> 02:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:44:39.750 --> 02:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
policy I'm also confident that
 
02:44:42.309 --> 02:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative finy comes from a good
 
02:44:44.790 --> 02:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
place when he's when he's doing this I
 
02:44:46.469 --> 02:44:46.479 align:start position:0%
do think think training can handle that
 
02:44:47.830 --> 02:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
I think police standards and training
 
02:44:50.429 --> 02:44:50.439 align:start position:0%
can be helpful in that but I also think
 
02:44:53.309 --> 02:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
accreditation which is now in the hands
 
02:44:55.030 --> 02:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
of police standards and training for
 
02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:56.429 align:start position:0%
of police standards and training for
many

02:44:56.429 --> 02:44:56.439 align:start position:0%
many
 
02:45:03.110 --> 02:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:06.030 --> 02:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
policy representative Stone thank you Mr
 
02:45:06.990 --> 02:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:45:09.150 --> 02:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
question Chief in your experience would
 
02:45:11.389 --> 02:45:11.399 align:start position:0%
you say there's a distinct value for law
 
02:45:13.070 --> 02:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement to have the utilization of
 
02:45:14.750 --> 02:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
unmarked vehicles in everyday law
 
02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:15.830 align:start position:0%
unmarked vehicles in everyday law
enforcement

02:45:15.830 --> 02:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
02:45:17.510 --> 02:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's a tool and I think you're
 
02:45:20.550 --> 02:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
right I think there is value to it as in
 
02:45:22.469 --> 02:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
any tool that law enforcement has to
 
02:45:26.030 --> 02:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:29.070 --> 02:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
Chief represent man thank you and thank
 
02:45:31.230 --> 02:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question is there a
 
02:45:32.910 --> 02:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
distinction between an unmarked vehicle
 
02:45:34.950 --> 02:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
and a stealth or ghost
 
02:45:39.670 --> 02:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:42.190 --> 02:45:42.200 align:start position:0%
of the distinction might be the cost of
 
02:45:44.710 --> 02:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
putting those putting those decals on
 
02:45:48.070 --> 02:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
there I roughly pay about the $1,200 to
 
02:45:50.230 --> 02:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
have my police cars marked I'm not so
 
02:45:53.389 --> 02:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
sure that's what that cost for a stealth
 
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle but they are marked um up with
 
02:45:58.910 --> 02:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
stealth markings um some are reflective
 
02:46:02.990 --> 02:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:05.870 --> 02:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony
 
02:46:09.309 --> 02:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
CH is there wishing to testify on this
 
02:46:11.030 --> 02:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
bill who has not yet
 
02:46:13.429 --> 02:46:13.439 align:start position:0%
testified seeing none I'm closing the
 
02:46:16.110 --> 02:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
public hearing on both of these
 
02:46:18.790 --> 02:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
