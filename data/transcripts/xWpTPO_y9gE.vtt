good good
 
00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
morning colleagues um welcome to
 
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration um
 
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson can you lead us
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
in the pledge
 
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely I pledge allegiance to the
 
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
flag of the United States of America and
 
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
to the Republic for which it stands one
 
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
nation under God indivisible with
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
liberty and justice for
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
all thank you uh a couple of bookkeeping
 
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
things you'll notice that we're in our
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
old double room here um but we are not
 
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
scheduled to be in it's it's not a
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
longlasting effect that we have going um
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
it will
 
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
be just for today I believe and we'll be
 
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
back to our um our scheduled single room
 
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
which I think is
 
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
203 um we share with house
 
00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
transportation and I don't mind telling
 
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
you that I sat there yesterday and and
 
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh it's a little strange going back to
 
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
the single room that we've been used to
 
00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
for years and years and years but I've
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
kind of grown accustomed to this double
 
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
room um at any rate that's uh item
 
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
number one item number two is the
 
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
scheduling that we have um nothing
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
changes on the schedule before you for
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
the 9 a.m. hearing and the 9:30 hearing
 
00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
and the h CH 25 10:00
 
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
hearing what will change
 
00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
is the next two um but I will be
 
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
addressing this again just before we
 
00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
break for lunch um 1367 the prime
 
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor has reached out to me um he has
 
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
a scheduling conflict for
 
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
10:30 but it also happens that he and he
 
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
is a sole sponsor of the that bill uh
 
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
1367 but he also is handling House Bill
 
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.120 align:start position:0%
1096 that's scheduled this
 
00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
afternoon so I have sent a note to him
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
and with courtesy um suggested that he
 
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
can um we can reschedule
 
00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
1367 to either just before or just
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
after House Bill
 
00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
1096 this
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
afternoon um
 
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
everyone get understand that little
 
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
tidbit um the next part is House Bill
 
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
1219 after I um put this schedule
 
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
together with uh our vice chair um this
 
00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor of 129 came and said she
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
to access her experts that need to
 
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
testify um for
 
00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:27.639 align:start position:0%
today so she has asked if we can
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
reschedule that to a different day as
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
well um so we're looking at the schedule
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
now nothing has been scheduled but again
 
00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
just before noon time I will um open and
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
recess 1219 to a date certain um
 
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
February and then we'll just move right
 
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
into the afternoon um after lunchtime um
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
I'll be handing the gavel to our vice
 
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
chair um and um and all of the remaining
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
bills will be done much more smoothly
 
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
than the morning bills for that
 
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
reason um so with that uh unless there's
 
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
any questions on on the scheduling that
 
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
I just mentioned um seeing none um we'll
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on House Bill 1495 I
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
recognize the prime sponsor in the room
 
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.350 align:start position:0%
recognize the prime sponsor in the room
representative

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
gearheart um welcome to legislative
 
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
Administration thank you chairman thank
 
00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
you committee for hearing this bill my
 
00:09:45.069 --> 00:09:45.079 align:start position:0%
name is Jason Gard I represent
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
Northfield Franklin marac 25 so this
 
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
bill came
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
about from initially actually reading a
 
00:09:54.509 --> 00:09:54.519 align:start position:0%
letter that Thomas Jefferson wrote to
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
James Madison in which he states that no
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
law can be permanent because no man is
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
permanent and he has a little
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
calculation where he figures about every
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
20 years all the laws should expire and
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
then be reintroduced or reapplied for if
 
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
they are needed the point being is we
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
need to figure out if the laws as far as
 
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned are in instituted to make
 
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
Society better safer so forth but if
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
they're not effective in doing so we
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
need to re-evaluate what's going on
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
because the repal process is pretty
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
cumbersome so as far as New Hampshire
 
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
goes this
 
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
bill would
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
dependent upon the percentage of the
 
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
general court that votes in favor give a
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
lifespan to a bill so here we go 51% to
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
64% the automatic repeal would happen
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
three years after its effective date if
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
the vote was 65% to 79% it would be
 
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
seven years and if it was
 
00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
80% upwards it would be 10 years the
 
00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
point being is if more people believe
 
00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:02.839 align:start position:0%
the bill is necessary then it should
 
00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:04.519 align:start position:0%
last a little bit longer to see how it
 
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
actually affects New Hampshire and
 
00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:09.399 align:start position:0%
Society in general and then there's
 
00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:12.639 align:start position:0%
another aspect to it towards the bottom
 
00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:16.279 align:start position:0%
paragraph four where well number four
 
00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:18.519 align:start position:0%
where you see that if aund registered
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
voters apply to the Secretary of State
 
00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
to make sure they're actually really
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
registered voters then a bill for repal
 
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
repeal of a bill it'll go before the
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
committee that has standing over it and
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
then they will decide whether to send it
 
00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
to the floor with a recommendation for
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
appeal so the concept being that the
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
Committees generally have a better
 
00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
concept of these bills and if they're
 
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
being if they're efficacious or not and
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
can deal with them as such so I
 
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
just I think it's important for people
 
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
to especially younger people to feel
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
like they actually have a say in what's
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
going on and it's not just a bunch of
 
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
laws that have been on the books forever
 
00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
that they have no connection with and
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
just really no feeling that you can
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
change it besides minor
 
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
let me back up I worry sometimes that we
 
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
try to edit and fix a bad Bill instead
 
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
of just letting it die and create
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
something new and figuring out where we
 
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
can go from here instead of just trying
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
to tweak the same thing that hasn't been
 
00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
working and as Ron Paul said there's no
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
such thing as a failed government
 
00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
program simply underfunded ones and I I
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
think that's kind of a major
 
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
problem so real quickly I just quote
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
from this letter that Thomas Jefferson
 
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.430 align:start position:0%
from this letter that Thomas Jefferson
wrote

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
wrote
 
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
the Earth belongs in usfr which is the
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
right to use and profits of something
 
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
belong to another to the living that the
 
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
dead have neither power powers nor
 
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
rights over
 
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
it and he the letter actually is he was
 
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
in France at the time and the French
 
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
Revolution was kicking off but his main
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
concern was that if a government is able
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
to contract debts greater than the
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
current generation could pay off it
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
leads to the dogs of war being loosed as
 
00:12:59.069 --> 00:12:59.079 align:start position:0%
it were and Perpetual War EMP ire
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
building and things we're all too
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
familiar with so that is why I
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
introduced it and I do understand that
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
there are some concerns with the
 
00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
percentage basis aspect of it I just
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
to Institute the will of the people into
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
the lifespan of the bill I think that's
 
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
key I don't want to just have a
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
universal every Bill last or 10 years I
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
think it should vary depending on the
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
percentage of the representatives I
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
believe it's needed
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
so if there's any questions I definitely
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
welcome them I understand this is kind
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you all done
 
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to uh take a prerogative
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
and ask the first question sure um so
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
just for clarification you had said um
 
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
depending on how the general court voted
 
00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
um but I'm seeing here that you mention
 
00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
only the house Clerk and and how the
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
vote how the bill passed from the House
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
of Representatives yes um there's
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
nothing in here that I could see that
 
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
that um recognizes how the vote um
 
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
occurred in the Senate is that one in
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
one hand you mentioned general court and
 
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
the other you mentioned just the House
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
of Representatives so what what are you
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
thinking understood in my mind I think
 
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
of General Court the House of
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives I think it's closer to
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
the people I don't really think the
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
Senate has much of a connection with the
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
people no offense that was that was just
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
my clarification I saw rep Pearson's
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr
 
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
rsas and it doesn't really matter which
 
00:14:57.839 --> 00:14:59.430 align:start position:0%
rsas and it doesn't really matter which
chapter

00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:03.079 align:start position:0%
there is a tremendous amount of
 
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:05.240 align:start position:0%
referencing as an ex you know and I
 
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
won't there's no need to give a specific
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
example but a lot of times what will
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
happen it it will reference another part
 
00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.269 align:start position:0%
happen it it will reference another part
of

00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
Statute not all of those things were
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
enacted at the same time so how would
 
00:15:21.749 --> 00:15:21.759 align:start position:0%
you deal under this premise how would
 
00:15:21.759 --> 00:15:23.230 align:start position:0%
you deal under this premise how would
you

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:23.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.069 align:start position:0%
you
deal

00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
deal
 
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
with a piece of Statute that references
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
expired because law can't reference a
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
piece of statue that doesn't
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
exist I would leave it up to the
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
Hill and now and
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
specifically are you familiar with RSA
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
1 because the expiration of RSA 1 ends
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
the State of New
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay okay so if we how do how
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
logistically would we go about
 
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
reenacting our existence when RSA 1
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
expires because it under this you you
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
leave no provision for the rare case of
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
something that must must be in
 
00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:21.079 align:start position:0%
perpetuity well I believe that would be
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
a the percentage basis for automatic
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
repeal is for new legislation but for
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
current legislation that would fall
 
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.550 align:start position:0%
current legislation that would fall
under

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral four which is the 100
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
registered voters so if we do have 100
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
registered voters that come forward and
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
say you know what I think it's time to
 
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
start over you know we're going to
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
change New Hampshire to another state
 
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
name or whatever then it would go before
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
the committee that would handle such
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
bill I don't even know what committee
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
would handle that but whatever it is and
 
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
then we would leave it up to
 
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
Representatives who represent the people
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
out

00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chairman good
 
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
morning good morning U thank you for
 
00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
your testimony um where else in our
 
00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
country is this happening is is this the
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
first piece of legislation anywhere in
 
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
our country to reference this type of
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
process as far as I understand but I
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
could be wrong I I the automatic repeal
 
00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:21.799 align:start position:0%
or sunsetting of bills is not new that I
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
was actually doing some research on this
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit and in the 70s apparently
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
there was a major push to Sunset a lot
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
of federal legislation being most of the
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
major big agencies were Exempted you
 
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
know the normal thing like the Pentagon
 
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
Camp pass and a that you so um yeah I
 
00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
believe this would be the
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
first thank you I'm going to hold
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
questions for a
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
while thank you um so I have another one
 
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.710 align:start position:0%
while thank you um so I have another one
sure

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:49.720 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
um if um if we are dealing with um uh
 
00:17:57.789 --> 00:17:57.799 align:start position:0%
concurrent bills or bills that that are
 
00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
on the same
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
topic um okay how and and one passes
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
with an amendment um that people in the
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
house seem to want more than the one
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
without the amendment and and the
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
percentages change how would you handle
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
something like
 
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
that on line 18 is if an act is further
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
amended by another legislative session
 
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
the time until the perspective appeal
 
00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:23.799 align:start position:0%
will follow the percentage of members
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
present voting ought to pass on the
 
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
further Amendment does that answer your
 
00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
question or am I incorrect um no and and
 
00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
it may be more that I um imprecisely
 
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
asked the
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
question but Suppose there are two
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation in the same
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
session okay that that are Al along the
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
same lines um and and all that one does
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
is perhaps have an amendment and that
 
00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
has for that reason had a higher um
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
support um but they but they handle the
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
same section of
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
law um how would we how would the clerk
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
how would any of us know which of these
 
00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
bills are going to be repealed in three
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
years versus 10
 
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
years I would say we should ER on the
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
side of repealing
 
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
sooner in general I I I don't really
 
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
know if that would occur because each
 
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
bill would have its own repeal date so
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
you're saying two bills deal with the
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
same topic my first question why we have
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
two Bill same section the same section
 
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
of law the same section of
 
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
law yeah I'm I'm having a little bit of
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
a hard time understanding that so that's
 
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
probably my fault just no but no um
 
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
following up on that what um are
 
00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
you at all open to the idea that some
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
sections of law should not be I I'm
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
presuming that there would be there
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
could easily be a gap of time when law
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist on that on a particular
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
topic um from the repeal date before it
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
gets reenacted M um suppose that would
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
be during the time that we have a um I
 
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
don't know a felony or a um or someone
 
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
that has to register on the sex offender
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
list or something along of a very
 
00:20:23.039 --> 00:20:24.270 align:start position:0%
list or something along of a very
serious

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
serious
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
nature can you foresee a time when when
 
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
there would be someone that would fall
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
between those gaps and and therefore um
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
not have a a piece of law affecting them
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
and be able to be um put on trial for
 
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
that action I I suppose that could
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
happen but at the same time if we have
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
three seven and 10 years respectively to
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
figure this out I think simple planning
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
could prevent that from occurring if we
 
00:20:54.029 --> 00:20:54.039 align:start position:0%
know a law is going to expire in that
 
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
many years I I don't see why that would
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
be an issue is when we already know
 
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
that's coming up for instance the
 
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
committee could then just or not the
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
committee representative could then put
 
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
that same bill back into effect ahead of
 
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
time do you know I don't know I just
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
don't think that would be a major
 
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
problem but there could be perhaps some
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
provision added in here I'm not saying
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
this is this is you know written in
 
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
stone I just I think we need some
 
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism for a getting old bills off
 
00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
the books that aren't effective and
 
00:21:24.669 --> 00:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
don't represent the will of the people
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
currently but just haven't been repealed
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
because time is limited obviously in
 
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
this this
 
00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.990 align:start position:0%
this this
house

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
um again prerogative here um time is
 
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
limited you're right um but we're but
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
you're now um making more of an
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
infringement on time you're having us
 
00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919 align:start position:0%
rehash legislation that may have only
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
come up two or three years ago
 
00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
automatically and I and I and I'm not
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
sure with Roman uh
 
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
4 why that can't be done now not with a
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
100 but but simply one why can't uh one
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
or two of of any constituents talk to us
 
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
about having a a bill repealed now
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
um because it wouldn't be an automatic
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
process you'd have to put the bill in
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
has to get scheduled and so forth where
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
this would just go right to the
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
committee no this is Roman four I'm
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
talking um yes in Roman 4 that would
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
have to be a 100 people that would sign
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
on yeah to to a petition somewhat um why
 
00:22:38.669 --> 00:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
why a 100 why can't it just be done with
 
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
one now we can one person can speak to
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
you as a representative and ask to have
 
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
um a bill put in to repeal any section
 
00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:50.990 align:start position:0%
um a bill put in to repeal any section
of

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.269 --> 00:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
more I think it would encourage more
 
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
citizen participation in a way and then
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
it would just automatically go to the
 
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
committee where they could review it I
 
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
just find it to be more streamlined I
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if that makes sense but in my
 
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
mind it makes it more streamlined so
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
they could just go to you and then now
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
you know okay there's at least 100
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
people in this state that just feel that
 
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is not necessary and then you
 
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
guys just take a quick vote it's five
 
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
minute hey up or down no okay boom it's
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
done and then you have to wait another
 
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
what every two years it can come up I
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean in my mind it seems
 
00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
cleaner than having to schedule a
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
hearing this and that it could be done
 
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
on the committee's own time whenever
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
they want hey we have these petitions
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
let's look through them real quick get
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
as I forgot your first part of that
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
question fine thank you um rep actually
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna go with rep
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
Sheen morning good morning thank you for
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you were just
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
discussing about um like a good law that
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
may be um sunsetted MH and you know
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
there would be you know several years to
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
make sure that it gets reenacted so
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
nothing falls through the cracks who
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
would be tracking that because that
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
would be a lot of work tracking you know
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of laws who who would who would be
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
work I don't know in my mind it seemed
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
like it would just be automatic with the
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
bill once it's passed it would have a
 
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
date I I just I guess an Excel
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet I mean I don't know I I
 
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
don't think it would be that comp at to
 
00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
do techn technologically but perhaps I'm
 
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
wrong just You' see okay these bills are
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
coming up for expiration maybe we can
 
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
make it so it turns yellow when they're
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
getting within six months and just kind
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
of go from
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
there yeah but who who would oversee
 
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chairman and and
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
following up on representative Shen's
 
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
questions um our house clerk has an
 
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
awful lot of work to do scheduling
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
everything all the time um I'm a little
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
surprised there's no fiscal note on this
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
because it's going to take more people
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
than our house clerk to handle this
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
volume we have what about a th000 bills
 
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
a year 900 to a th000 and um that means
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
someone's going to have to sit down and
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
keep going through bill after Bill after
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
Bill and you know they're all published
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
in those thick books that's going to how
 
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
is this a manageable process if I may
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
say I think we got to think about the
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
average person who lives in New
 
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not just the political class
 
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
but let's say a car mechanic and so
 
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
forth they have to know about all the
 
00:25:42.669 --> 00:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
laws technically ignorance of the law is
 
00:25:44.909 --> 00:25:44.919 align:start position:0%
no excuse so maybe we need to be cutting
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
down on the amount of laws we pass just
 
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
in general I I find it interesting that
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
we talk about the volume of laws but we
 
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
don't talk about the volume of laws that
 
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
the average person who's paying our
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
salaries have to Fig has to figure out
 
00:25:59.070 --> 00:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
in order to navigate every day now we
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
can say well certain laws are specific
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know areas of the but still
 
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
technically we need to know of every law
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's passed and I just think there
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be more check on those laws and
 
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
I think giving them a lifespan like
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
people would kind of be a good thing rep
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you very much for your
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
answer um I'm looking at Roman numeral
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
number four down at the bottom of the
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
page yes and it says um upon receipt to
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
the SEC Secretary of State of 100
 
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
registered New Hampshire voters the
 
00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
current law may be requested for repal
 
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on in terms of the
 
00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:37.559 align:start position:0%
process of that sometimes it's not too
 
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
hard to get a 100 people to do something
 
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
but then you've got the whole rest of
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
the state are we going to put the this
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
whole process before the house to try to
 
00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
figure out if something's to be repealed
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
because 100 people from One Community or
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
one District want it or how is this
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.149 align:start position:0%
 
work

00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
how would it work if 100 people say they
 
00:27:02.389 --> 00:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
wanted a bill repealed well it would
 
00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
come before the committee who has
 
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over it or I don't know if
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
the proper word is for that but whoever
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
has the oversight of that and then they
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
would just have an up or down vote I
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
just think it should be on the record I
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
think it's important there's certain
 
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
laws that I don't believe people really
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
support anymore but there's not enough
 
00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
political will to repeal them for
 
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
various reasons special interest groups
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
or so and I just think that this would
 
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.590 align:start position:0%
or so and I just think that this would
allow

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
now I I'm thinking of nonviolent
 
00:27:29.789 --> 00:27:29.799 align:start position:0%
victimless crimes a lot of those kind of
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
bills that's really what this was aimed
 
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
for I I don't really care about Nuance
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
tax law state tax law kind of stuff that
 
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't really concern me but it's
 
00:27:39.789 --> 00:27:39.799 align:start position:0%
things that people would end up on the
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
wrong side of the law for and losing
 
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
their Liberty on that's what I think is
 
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
important to reevaluate
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
frequently rep
 
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
sers thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
00:27:54.669 --> 00:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
representer for U bringing this forward
 
00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
because one thing we do have is too many
 
00:27:59.389 --> 00:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
bills we pass every year and 10 years
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
down the road we got three or 4,000
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
5,000 bills on the books so in addition
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
to what we already had so one of my
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
questions is is what happens to the
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
hb2 that's a good question
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
I I'll have to get back to on one
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
followup and and I realize you're
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
looking for guidance from us here as as
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
well it's and it's not a 100% Big Bill
 
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
but you're just bringing it forward for
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
us um are you expecting the repal
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
process or the the process that you got
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
here and and uh to go before committee
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
like us or i' go before the entire house
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
for repeal so you're referencing Roman
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
numeral 4 there 100 votes to I I was I
 
00:28:54.509 --> 00:28:54.519 align:start position:0%
was thinking the committee would be a
 
00:28:54.519 --> 00:28:56.070 align:start position:0%
was thinking the committee would be a
better

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:28:59.470 --> 00:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
environment because they have subject
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
matter knowledge of the topics at hand
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
or or supposedly do does if that makes
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
sense and they could just give an up and
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
down vote now if you should put some if
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
there should be some kind of mechanism
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
to challenge that on the floor I suppose
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
that could be done but yeah I didn't
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
really think that' be I'm trying to keep
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
this simple I got it down the one page
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
but it definitely could use a little bit
 
00:29:26.909 --> 00:29:26.919 align:start position:0%
of love not going to lie I give you a
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
credit for for that uh R Pearson thank
 
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
00:29:33.389 --> 00:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
chair you
 
00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:36.919 align:start position:0%
mentioned the lifespan of people but
 
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
this bill almost references the lifespan
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
of a goldfish yes okay when you're
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
talking about three three years seven
 
00:29:48.909 --> 00:29:48.919 align:start position:0%
years 10 years
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
MH we currently process as on average
 
00:29:55.509 --> 00:29:55.519 align:start position:0%
right about a thousand bills a
 
00:30:00.509 --> 00:30:00.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:02.909 --> 00:30:02.919 align:start position:0%
overturn about a third of our membership
 
00:30:02.919 --> 00:30:07.190 align:start position:0%
overturn about a third of our membership
each

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
election unless this passes and then it
 
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
would be about probably
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
90% in the next bium
 
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
is do you have a grasp of the volume of
 
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
work that would come forward to a
 
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.830 align:start position:0%
work that would come forward to a
volunteer

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
legislature if this was
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
enacted 3 years from now with a house
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
that's virtually 5050 do you do you have
 
00:30:42.909 --> 00:30:42.919 align:start position:0%
a sense of the volume of of the
 
00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:46.039 align:start position:0%
workload let me address the first part
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
first the the reason Thomas Jefferson's
 
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
calculations of all laws and he included
 
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
the Constitution I don't think we really
 
00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
should go that far but he figured it was
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
about 19 years a generation of men so
 
00:31:00.509 --> 00:31:00.519 align:start position:0%
forth the reason I went with 3 S and 10
 
00:31:03.389 --> 00:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
is they seem like good numbers but also
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
because nowadays it's much easier to see
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
if something is effective you can tell
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
if you pass a law if it reduces or
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
eliminates the problem for which it was
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
intended pretty quickly with technology
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take six months to send a
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
letter from New York to London so I
 
00:31:24.509 --> 00:31:24.519 align:start position:0%
think the the time span can be sped up
 
00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:27.559 align:start position:0%
drastically secondly the as far far as
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
the volume of
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
work I would again refer back to my
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
previous comments I I think if we're
 
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
requiring the average person lizen new
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
hampire to know all these laws then the
 
00:31:38.669 --> 00:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
least we can do is look at these laws
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
every few years to figure out they're
 
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
actually doing what they're supposed to
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
do I I don't know I just have a
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
simplistic perhaps notion of laws and
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
the purpose of legislatures but I think
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
so this also came about real quickly I
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
was reading about I forget which
 
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
Scandinavian country it was but back in
 
00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
around 1000 ad they had a title in the
 
00:32:01.629 --> 00:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
government called the lawgiver and every
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
three years I'm sorry well every year he
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
would have to repeat verbatim from
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
memory a third of the law and anything
 
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
he didn't remember or speak was removed
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
from the books so the whole point being
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
is if you can't remember the laws you've
 
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
passed a maybe we have too many laws or
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
B maybe they're too complicated at the
 
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
you know for instance just real quick
 
00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
federal law the IRS code 60 something
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
thousand pages and we're expecting the
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
average guy you know who's a
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
veterinarian or works on cars to figure
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
that out just so that's that's kind of
 
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:34.919 align:start position:0%
where I'm with that if that makes
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm kind of uh the average guy I have
 
00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
a full-time job I own a
 
00:32:50.909 --> 00:32:50.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
dog and I volunteer to come up here
 
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
weaving in and out of all of that
 
00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
and I agree with representative wall
 
00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
about the lack of a fiscal note here um
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
are you are you simultaneously
 
00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
advocating then for this to become a
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
full-time legislature in order to handle
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
the workload that will come from this
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
proposal I'll just answer that with one
 
00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
word never no I think the part-time
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
legislature is key to the New Hampshire
 
00:33:23.789 --> 00:33:23.799 align:start position:0%
experience as it
 
00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
were thank you um one thing I would ask
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
is uh you to complete a pink card oh
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
sorry about that yeah y you got it um
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
thank you other than that I think we're
 
00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:36.519 align:start position:0%
good thank you very much thank you very
 
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:40.519 align:start position:0%
much I have no other pink cards on
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
this I do actually um our house clerk um
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
I didn't fill out a pink card but I will
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
can I speak real quick if you fill out a
 
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
pink card sure
 
00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:55.720 align:start position:0%
um the chair recognizes our host clerk
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
committee um as you know Paul Smith
 
00:34:03.149 --> 00:34:03.159 align:start position:0%
Clerk of the house uh as usual not
 
00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:05.559 align:start position:0%
testifying in support or opposed to
 
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
legislation merely providing you some
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
information uh last week I briefly spoke
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor of this legislation um
 
00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
expressing some uh concerns he asked me
 
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
how uh I thought he could make the bill
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
better um the only way truly I think uh
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
he can accomplish what he wants is that
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
any perspective
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
legislation going forward would have an
 
00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
automatic repeal date that's the only
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
way I see this new mechanism working uh
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
because otherwise this idea uh is novel
 
00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
um and and and I I say that uh in the in
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
the true sense of the word novel um I'm
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
not suggesting that putting in an
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
automatic repeal is a good idea I'm just
 
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
suggesting that that might be what the
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor is looking to do uh other than
 
00:34:58.750 --> 00:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
that I do have some concerns I'd like to
 
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
share with you um specifically that the
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
language is vague confusing and not at
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
all correct in terms of structure in
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
Roman 4 for example it refers to the
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate statutory Committee in the
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
house with jurisdiction over the subject
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
matter of the bill it then goes on to
 
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
speak of the bill to be repealed um I
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
assume that this should be standing
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
committee of the house as a statutory
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
committee is defined in RSA 1449 as this
 
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
committee knows just about better than
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the planet after having
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
worked on this issue for the last three
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
years uh I to to representative
 
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
Pearson's Point structurally what
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
happens when the house is out of session
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
for those six months every year um
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
specifically during the summer and the
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
fall in the citizen initiated drive to
 
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
repeal a law uh by the by the way it
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
isn't a matter of repealing a bill
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
because once a bill is signed it is
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
law I want to make that distinction
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
clear it's not just a bill anymore it is
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
law uh here's another Point that's
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
concerning in order to repeal a law now
 
00:36:08.309 --> 00:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
it has to go through the entire
 
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
legislative process meaning both bodies
 
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
and signed by the governor of New
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the language in this text
 
00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:17.079 align:start position:0%
ignores the other branch of the general
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
court now granted I am a bit adversarial
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
to the other side of the wall as you all
 
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
know but we are still a by camera
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
legislature until you all pass cacr to
 
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
become a unical
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
legislature and frankly this language
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
ignores the deliberative nature of the
 
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
general court by having public hearings
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
or involving the Senate and admittedly
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
as a product of the house myself I can't
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
ignore that there's no mention of the
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
other body and their abilities as a
 
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
co-equal part of the legislature
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
therefore I am concerned about the
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of this
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
legislation I did speak with the
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
director of os last week and inquired
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
about the lack of fiscal note because uh
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
as the clerk and chief legislative
 
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
officer of the house I can tell you I
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
will need to hire somebody If This Were
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
to become law um to work exclusively on
 
00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
this novel idea of tracking all house
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
passage of bills by
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
percentages uh possibly session only but
 
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
it would be a devoted staffer
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
nonetheless additionally as this would
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
be a new process involving not only the
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
legislative branch but the Secretary of
 
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
State as well I assume there may be
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
additional incom is felt by that office
 
00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
in order to fulfill the novel mission of
 
00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.910 align:start position:0%
in order to fulfill the novel mission of
this

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
legislation additionally as this
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
committee well knows um having worked
 
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
extensively on rsa1
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
1449 there have been
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
workarounds since that legislation was
 
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
passed our new favorite word is
 
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding and legislation is
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
frequently drafted now that says
 
00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding RSA 1449 a commission
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
consisting of 900 persons shall be
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
formed doing whatever and I am concerned
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
that you know even if this were to pass
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
the the notwithstanding loophole would
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
would essentially become part of any
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation moving forward and
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
that would be perfectly
 
00:38:12.359 --> 00:38:14.030 align:start position:0%
that would be perfectly
allowable

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
allowable
 
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
lastly we don't simply nullify in the
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
legislature my friends we do not simply
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
nullify this this language in section 4
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
is a form of direct democracy that was
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
not envisioned by the framers of the New
 
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution otherwise it
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
would be explicitly enumerated so given
 
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
those points uh I I felt it necessary to
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
um share with you those concerns
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
regarding this piece of
 
00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you Mr clar uh any
 
00:38:47.069 --> 00:38:47.079 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
much I have one last pink card on this
 
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
uh this bill um the chair recognizes uh
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative patent
 
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
who indicates she's not supporting or
 
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
opposing but apparently wishing to
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
amend welcome to legislative
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
Administration thank you um so of course
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify on the next bill
 
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
that's up so I just wanted to speak
 
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
literally one minute on this only
 
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
because I understand where the sponsor
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
was coming from
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
and I believe
 
00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
especially being in new rep
 
00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
um let's just talk about the volume of
 
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
bills 900 a th000 or what's going what
 
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
what runs through and there's no checks
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
and balances that's really the problem
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
there's there's no one that's telling
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
you and they're all paid in OSS hey this
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
bill is really unconstitutional this
 
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be filed and that would
 
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
decrease the level of bills that are
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
coming in and I don't know if it would
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
be ger to amend it like that but there
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
needs to be like checks and balances
 
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
that are in there and instead of us of
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
course and I understand where he's
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
coming from we're passing all of these
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
laws right and a lot of them that are on
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
the books um there's tons of conf
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
conflicts in statute I know we're
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
handling it um I know HHS is handling
 
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
some of those conflicts they're being
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
handled in committees all the time we
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
handled it three times last time where
 
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
we're basically passing something to
 
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
make it make sense because it says one
 
00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
thing over here and says another thing
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
over there I mean I just I think going
 
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
through all of our laws on the books and
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
really showing where they where they are
 
00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
you know unconstitutional in repealing
 
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
them is is totally a pathway I think we
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
should be focused on that as the
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
legislature you know it's kind of like a
 
00:40:45.069 --> 00:40:45.079 align:start position:0%
dual thing I have no idea how if that
 
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
could be amended here but in a sense
 
00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
that's where I I kind of hear where he's
 
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
coming from because we get very very
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
busy pushing things through and you know
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of laws that are on the
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
books that if they don't have any
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism and no teeth
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
they're not worth the paper that they're
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
written on so um making the book bigger
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't help so I just wanted to give my
 
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
two cents on that thank you very much um
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
I don't speaking out of turn here and
 
00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:17.319 align:start position:0%
and for the whole committee I don't
 
00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:21.880 align:start position:0%
think we are um adversarial to the to
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
the idea and I do personally appreciate
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
any kind of new idea that comes along
 
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
that can address the volume I look at it
 
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
as just the opposite I think this
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
increases the the volume exponentially
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
um I think we'll be looking over bills
 
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
that um that we just we just looked at
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
but you know I I too can be wrong um I I
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
think I don't want to selch new ideas
 
00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
coming forward though um and I do think
 
00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
that is uh to be applauded right thank
 
00:41:59.230 --> 00:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
time having no other pink cards I think
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
I'm ready to close the hearing
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
1495 it'll be a minute here to reset and
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:55.150 align:start position:0%
 
FN

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.160 --> 00:43:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
wa

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
the time being
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
940 um we'll open the hearing on House
 
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 1666 FN relative to income
 
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements for
 
00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
lobbyists uh chair recognizes the prime
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor rep
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
Penza um who has obviously in support of
 
00:43:47.069 --> 00:43:47.079 align:start position:0%
the bill and says she needs three
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.079 --> 00:44:04.390 align:start position:0%
 
back

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I come to you
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
today um this was probably um one of the
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
first ideas I had to put in a bill most
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
of the other ideas came from
 
00:44:17.309 --> 00:44:17.319 align:start position:0%
constituents and just from the
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
experience of of being here um you know
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
kind of as a just a regular Regular Joe
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
activist in coming to testify committees
 
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
and now being a part of the legislature
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
um I've just noticed some some real
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
issues and I sent this this bill idea
 
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
out uh to the entire house and I got a
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
huge amount of response um this is a
 
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
this is a nonpartisan I heard from just
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
as many uh Democrats as I did from
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
Republicans that are um interested in
 
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
this and they had to be turned away
 
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
because not everybody of course can be
 
00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
signed on as a co-sponsor
 
00:44:59.470 --> 00:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
um requiring lobbyists to report their
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
income it's really crucial for
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability in the
 
00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
political process when lobbyists
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
disclose their income it helps identify
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
of course potential conflicts of
 
00:45:11.069 --> 00:45:11.079 align:start position:0%
interest between their financial
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
interests and the policies specifically
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
that they advocate for so this
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
transparency allows the public and
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
policy makers to understand the
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
financial relationships between
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
lobbyists and their entities and the
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
industries of course that they represent
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
full disclosure of income expenditures
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
by lobbyists of course helps prevent
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
corruption undue influence unethical
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
practices in government decision making
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
it allows for a clear understanding of
 
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
who is attempting to influence policy
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
makers and to what extent fostering a
 
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
more transparent and Equitable
 
00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
Democratic constitutional republic
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
process additionally it enables
 
00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:52.839 align:start position:0%
regulatory bodies to monitor compliance
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
with lobbying laws and regulations and
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
of course it ensures that lobbying
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
activities adhere to the same ethical
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
standards that we all do have to um in
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature or as um holding
 
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.589 align:start position:0%
the legislature or as um holding
political

00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
political
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
office so I think one of the biggest
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
concerns about with politicians or
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
associations corporations paying
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
lobbyists isn't inherently about the act
 
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
itself because uh especially for uh
 
00:46:21.069 --> 00:46:21.079 align:start position:0%
seasoned legislators that are here um
 
00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
it's a legitimate way for various
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
interests to communicate their
 
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
viewpoints to law makers they have uh
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
they they get paid a lot we we get paid
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
um $100 so uh they get paid a lot and
 
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
they have research teams and things like
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
that which is great so having those
 
00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
having that information is wonderful but
 
00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
there's potential issues that arise when
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
that relationship pretty much between
 
00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
these entities politicians lobbyists
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
corporations all of that kind of stuff
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
involves con conflict of interest lack
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
of transparency and undo influence so
 
00:47:02.549 --> 00:47:02.559 align:start position:0%
I believe that this bill um Can can help
 
00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:05.240 align:start position:0%
uh write a ship that I think is steering
 
00:47:09.069 --> 00:47:09.079 align:start position:0%
in the wrong direction um there has been
 
00:47:11.549 --> 00:47:11.559 align:start position:0%
there's been so much that uh I will send
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
you my testimony um there has been a lot
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
of stuff that's been printed on this for
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
several years and just in 2019 there was
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
a a wonderful article that was on nhpr
 
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
that says you know as LOB being in New
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire grows more complex it's nearly
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
impossible to follow the money in New
 
00:47:34.829 --> 00:47:34.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's a
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
problem so I asked a question I'm in the
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
straford county um along with
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative wall so you we're you
 
00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
know our delegation smaller than of
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
course you know Rockingham and and
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro but and just to kind of
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
understand the level of you know
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
lobbying efforts or people that are
 
00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
hired to do government relation and
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
things like that so there's a there's a
 
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
you know it's a County Association that
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
has all of the counties that are part of
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
it and I just didn't understand there
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
how the County Association which is all
 
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
elected officials are who's paying into
 
00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
that Association than to pay a lobbyist
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
when that lobbyist is here working
 
00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.030 align:start position:0%
when that lobbyist is here working
against

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
legislation that is representative maybe
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
of a republican principal so there's so
 
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
much conflicts of interest and when I
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
asked those questions to um one of the
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
lobbying groups here uh in New Hampshire
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
I got back like where this you know New
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of counties for
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
example is paying tens of thousands of
 
00:48:48.789 --> 00:48:48.799 align:start position:0%
dollars that's our money to then be used
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
against potential legislation that I
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
could file or others can file it just
 
00:48:57.069 --> 00:48:57.079 align:start position:0%
seems like a a a a a circle that needs
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
to be um cut off and and I can give lots
 
00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
of other examples that I've seen um
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
through uh agencies um that are really
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
concerning um where you know an agency
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
says that they're they don't have any
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
stake in the game and then they come and
 
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
they send letters and testimony and then
 
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
you have you automatically see that the
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
same talking points that are coming from
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
the lobbying group is what the agency is
 
00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
saying and um um and lots and lots of
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
meetings that are happening in these
 
00:49:31.349 --> 00:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
agencies that are working against the
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
legislature where in a sense we're
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to be you know we're supposed
 
00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:38.839 align:start position:0%
to be kind of the the driving factor
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
with different agencies whether it be
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know Dees um there's just a you know
 
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
HHS there's a lot of that stuff that's
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
going on so that's why I filed this bill
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
um I've got overwhelming support I have
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
one amendment that I'm going to make and
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
the only reason why it wasn't put in was
 
00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
because you know um this came to me when
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
OLS was backed up I had a change they
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't put it in based upon the
 
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
deadline it is on uh line nine uh on
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
page two and it says um it says the
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
amount dates received and source of all
 
00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
income earned by the lobbyist in the
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
prior calendar year in excess of
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
$5,000 and then we wipe out for lobbying
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
activity um that line gets wiped out and
 
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
then whether paid directly by the client
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
the employer or or other third party
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
that is the change I'm going to take out
 
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
those three words so there'll be
 
00:50:40.789 --> 00:50:40.799 align:start position:0%
Amendment coming in for that and then I
 
00:50:43.069 --> 00:50:43.079 align:start position:0%
can send you a whole bunch of resources
 
00:50:45.549 --> 00:50:45.559 align:start position:0%
about this as well
 
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
so any
 
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
questions I don't know I will ask
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
um rep Pearson you have a question I do
 
00:51:01.549 --> 00:51:01.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
a practical
 
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
reality of this activity
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
so here's my here's my question to you
 
00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.069 align:start position:0%
so here's my here's my question to you
the

00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
NRA have
 
00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:29.240 align:start position:0%
as an organization lobbyists in New
 
00:51:32.829 --> 00:51:32.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay would that
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
lobbyist who is works for the NRA have
 
00:51:36.599 --> 00:51:37.630 align:start position:0%
lobbyist who is works for the NRA have
to

00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
file a massive massive report showing
 
00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
all of the income the sources and the
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
work that the NRA does nationally
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
because they're not it's not an
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
outsourced lobbying firm they don't pay
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
a firm that's like across the street
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
that we have the lobbying firms that
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
that exist in conquered they send their
 
00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:01.720 align:start position:0%
person directly from the
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
organization so how is that logistically
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
going to work when you have a National
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
Organization coming to Lobby before this
 
00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
body so this really speaks to all of the
 
00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:15.559 align:start position:0%
processes that have been in place for a
 
00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
long time so for example if I'm going to
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
register for a lobbyist I've got to have
 
00:52:21.069 --> 00:52:21.079 align:start position:0%
an orange badge I'm kind of walking
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
around all the Halls here this is really
 
00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
what that applies to if someone is
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
coming in to speak let's say they're a
 
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
guest speaker and they're working for a
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
national lobbying group they are not
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
coming here to New Hampshire they're not
 
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
working in New Hampshire they don't
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
they're not filing and having to give
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
that kind of information to be
 
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
registered here in the state they don't
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
have to have an orange badge to come
 
00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
testify that's not happening as
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
frequently as what I'm talking about
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
this bill speaks specifically to the
 
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
folks in New Hampshire is what I'm
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
here I'm sensing there will be a
 
00:52:54.319 --> 00:52:56.950 align:start position:0%
here I'm sensing there will be a
followup

00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
followup
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
only because that's not how it works the
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
NRA if they bring a lobbyist to New
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to testify they have to
 
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
register that's not optional so they
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
they they're not coming up here to speak
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
as a private citizen I'm just using it
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
as an example because they because
 
00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:11.799 align:start position:0%
they're a large National
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
Organization they are not exempt from
 
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
our very specific lobbying rules that
 
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
exist in this building so I'm just
 
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
trying to get the Practical reality of
 
00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:25.789 align:start position:0%
trying to get the Practical reality of
how

00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:25.799 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
they will comply with this if it
 
00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
passes So based upon my
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge I don't so for example in a
 
00:53:38.309 --> 00:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
this was before I was a State Rep there
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
was um a doctor that was part of um an
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
association in a sense that came here to
 
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
testify they were part they were coming
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
they said that they were coming on
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
behalf of themselves as a doctor not as
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
that Association which is a lobbying
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
group as well they didn't have to
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
register they came in they flew in from
 
00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
another state to testify so I understand
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
where you're coming from but those are
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
one-off situations they are not if they
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
if they are here testifying on a regular
 
00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
basis they're going to have to have the
 
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
orange badge that's not
 
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
happening what in what you're talking
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
about you're talking about like one-off
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
situations anybody that is here on a
 
00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:21.160 align:start position:0%
regular basis that registers with the
 
00:54:23.789 --> 00:54:23.799 align:start position:0%
state to be able to testify on a regular
 
00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:25.640 align:start position:0%
basis they're I mean they're
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
you guys know you're in the Committees
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
they're here all the time I'm how many
 
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
are here right now so um there we see
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
the same faces over and over that's what
 
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about I I I think I can
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
clarify a little bit there's a
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
miscommunication going on there are
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
organizations that um are National
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
organizations that have lobbyists here
 
00:54:50.349 --> 00:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
um that are registered lobbyists they do
 
00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:52.839 align:start position:0%
qualify under the lobbying
 
00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
category the concern I think the
 
00:54:58.030 --> 00:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
representative has is when they belong
 
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
to that that National
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
Organization they would have to under
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
this the language of
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
this would they not have to list all of
 
00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:10.710 align:start position:0%
this would they not have to list all of
their

00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:12.230 align:start position:0%
their
lobbying

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
lobbying
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
Nationwide for the entire
 
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
organization that's that was I think the
 
00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.710 align:start position:0%
organization that's that was I think the
question

00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's so they are listing under three the
 
00:55:25.029 --> 00:55:25.039 align:start position:0%
amount dates received and source of all
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
income earned by the lobbyist in Prior
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
calendar year in excess of $5,000
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
whether paid directly by the client the
 
00:55:34.349 --> 00:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
employer or third party I'm here I'm
 
00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
coming to testify I work for the NRA I
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
get paid
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
$70,000 I'm going to report where that
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
income is coming from who my clients are
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's it not I'm not we're not having
 
00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
the NRA disclose every entity that's
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
paying them no this is specific to the
 
00:55:54.079 --> 00:55:56.630 align:start position:0%
paying them no this is specific to the
employee

00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:55:59.870 --> 00:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
the person that's it's just exactly
 
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
think of it like us what we have to
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
report every single one of us here has
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
to do disclosures and report that kind
 
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
of income that is what I'm asking we're
 
00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
we're asking for the same playing field
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
that the politicians have to do for the
 
00:56:17.549 --> 00:56:17.559 align:start position:0%
people here that are following
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
legislation a lot more closely than most
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
of us that are in that
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
400 thank
 
00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
you other questions
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
testimony the next pin card I have is
 
00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
for representative gearhard um who says
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
he supports the bill and needs two
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
minutes actually
 
00:56:51.069 --> 00:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
less representative Gard Northfield
 
00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
Franklin so I'm actually a co-sponsor on
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
this bill and I was just going to speak
 
00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.950 align:start position:0%
this bill and I was just going to speak
to

00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
the financial um fiscal note so the
 
00:57:07.029 --> 00:57:07.039 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State believes that they'll
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
need to hire a new employee to monitor
 
00:57:14.829 --> 00:57:14.839 align:start position:0%
the filings at $35,000 a year I would
 
00:57:18.029 --> 00:57:18.039 align:start position:0%
somebody said no oh so my only
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
suggestion would be that this fee burden
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
be taken on by the lobbyists some way
 
00:57:26.029 --> 00:57:26.039 align:start position:0%
some shape some form some kind of fee
 
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
just to offset it from the actual
 
00:57:29.309 --> 00:57:29.319 align:start position:0%
general public just a minor note that's
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
all I only need a minute something like
 
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
how New York city has the taxi
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
medallions so we need little lobbyist
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
medallions all right so that's all I
 
00:57:39.630 --> 00:57:39.640 align:start position:0%
want to say thank you thank you uh
 
00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.990 align:start position:0%

someone pay a permit to
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
speak in front of a committee in a
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
public hearing it's a fee to offset the
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
cost of monitoring their
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%

00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
there um we have before us Olivia Zen um
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
and and supports the bill with edits uh
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
and is asking for 2 minutes representing
 
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
open democracy um good morning members
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Olivia zinc
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
I'm a voter in Franklin and I represent
 
00:59:08.349 --> 00:59:08.359 align:start position:0%
an organization called open democracy
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
who believes in transparency and I think
 
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
what this bill is trying to get to is
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
additional transparency I do uh want to
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
say that on line five the name address
 
00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:19.720 align:start position:0%
and phone number of the lobbyist is
 
00:59:22.829 --> 00:59:22.839 align:start position:0%
something we already do um so probably
 
00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:25.720 align:start position:0%
not additional need to the stat stute on
 
00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
line nine for prior calendar year
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
currently uh lobbyists file April um
 
00:59:35.789 --> 00:59:35.799 align:start position:0%
24th for the period of activity January
 
00:59:38.109 --> 00:59:38.119 align:start position:0%
February and March um they're filed
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
quarterly they file quarterly reports so
 
00:59:43.029 --> 00:59:43.039 align:start position:0%
I do think line nine needs to sort of be
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
consistent with the quarterly reports
 
00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
unless we want to change these reports
 
00:59:49.029 --> 00:59:49.039 align:start position:0%
to annual which I don't think is
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
probably needed quarterly is probably
 
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
acceptable y quarterly is you can keep
 
00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
that on line
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
20 I think that it would be important
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
for the Secretary of State and the
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to look at who enforces
 
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
these uh laws um I did write to know the
 
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to see how many
 
01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
enforcements they've done on lobbying
 
01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:11.240 align:start position:0%
reports and I got a big fat zero uh
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
they've never enforced this law um so I
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
think that it's more important that the
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
law get enforced whether it's the
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
attorney general or the Secretary of
 
01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:21.640 align:start position:0%
State or who does that I do like this
 
01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
notion um that online um
 
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
28 whereas if a lobbyist is 10 days late
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
filing the report the S the Secretary of
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
State sends an email notifying them to
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
to complete their report I do want to
 
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
tell this committee that um on September
 
01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
21st 2021 there was a note from the
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
attorney general to Bill Gardner on how
 
01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
to file the laws because they're
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
confusing and lobbyists fill out these
 
01:00:51.549 --> 01:00:51.559 align:start position:0%
things inconsistently I do recommend the
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
committee read this attorney general's
 
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.069 align:start position:0%
committee read this attorney general's
memo

01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
memo
 
01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
um because right now every lobbyist
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
fills out reports differently and I
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
think um it's important for us to
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
realize how many register lobbyists pay
 
01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
$50 annually to register um 10 years ago
 
01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
in 2014 we had 249 registered lobbyists
 
01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:17.240 align:start position:0%
um I looked at I tried to pull up
 
01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
today's numbers but there wasn't a
 
01:01:20.589 --> 01:01:20.599 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet yet be I think it's just
 
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
because people are still filing
 
01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
registrations for the year so it would
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
be interesting
 
01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
um but in um 2008 here's the list of
 
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
registered lobbyists it's 89 pages long
 
01:01:35.789 --> 01:01:35.799 align:start position:0%
with 10 to 11 P names per lobbyist so we
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
have had a huge growth in that um I do
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
also want to point out open Secrets
 
01:01:44.029 --> 01:01:44.039 align:start position:0%
ranked all 50 states with a score of 20
 
01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
on state lobbying disclosure and New
 
01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gets a 10.25 so we're getting
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
half of what we should be for disclosure
 
01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
um timel uh but userfriendly so so
 
01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
people can find this information we get
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
a0 75 our system is not userfriendly
 
01:02:06.269 --> 01:02:06.279 align:start position:0%
it's done on paper quarterly there is no
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
way to email your lobbyist report to the
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State you can only fax it
 
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
or hand deliver it or mail it so maybe
 
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
thinking about it's a it's a fillable
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
PDF why not let them fill it send it
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
into the secretary of state that way the
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State doesn't have to scan
 
01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
all of these reports then when you try
 
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
to find it on the Secretary of State
 
01:02:27.069 --> 01:02:27.079 align:start position:0%
website good luck cuz it's really
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
difficult to find them but I did bring
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
examples of multiple different lobbyists
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
who fill out these reports in wildly
 
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
different ways um so right now there's
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
just very inconsistency of how lobbying
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
reports are filled out and maybe we
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
could look at simplifying the form and
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
making the form clear because the the
 
01:02:47.269 --> 01:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
form says by all your clients and some
 
01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
people do the totals but it should be of
 
01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
that client that you're filing the
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
report for um which is you know you
 
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
could you could change the way the form
 
01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:57.559 align:start position:0%
is read and and I think you might get
 
01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
more compliance I'm happy to take any
 
01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:03.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there any
 
01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
questions I have one um I had uh circled
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
the part um online three for a single
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
clear concise and accurate Financial
 
01:03:17.269 --> 01:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
disclosure statement we would all like
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
to think that our financial statements
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
are clear concise and accurate um but it
 
01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that if there was a
 
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.029 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that if there was a
single

01:03:26.029 --> 01:03:26.039 align:start position:0%
single
 
01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
form it would um make it easier for
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
anyone that has to try to um weed
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
through any of these financial
 
01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
statements in order to get the correct
 
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
information is that clear uh well
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
currently you have to fill out your
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
cover page one let me just say there's
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh multiple pieces of paper that a
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
lobbyist has to fill out they have to
 
01:03:50.269 --> 01:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
fill out this piece of paper with their
 
01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:51.799 align:start position:0%
the name of their lobbyist the name of
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
their partnership firm or Corporation um
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
and the period of the which they're
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
filing it then they have to do an
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
addendum a and the addendum a is several
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
pages long which lists the amount that's
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
paid in that period um and the expenses
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
so the fees received and the expenses
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
you then have to do an amendment B and
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
the amendment B is if I bought you a cup
 
01:04:17.309 --> 01:04:17.319 align:start position:0%
of coffee I'd have to write that I
 
01:04:19.309 --> 01:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
bought a Lobby uh somebody a cup of
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
coffee or whatever you know I think that
 
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
there is a limit so maybe a cup of
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
coffee doesn't qualify I think it has to
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
be over $5 but sometimes coffee a Tesla
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
can be $5 actually there we can't gift
 
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
Lobby lobbyists can't gift you anything
 
01:04:36.109 --> 01:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
more than $25 so you know if I'm GNA buy
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
you a few beers I have to buy bed light
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of them um because I can't give
 
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
you more than 25 um then they have to
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
file addendum C which is any political
 
01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:48.799 align:start position:0%
contributions that lobbying firms made
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
the addendum C's are frankly the
 
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
messiest part of this process because
 
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
many lobbyists make political
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
contributions but the addendum C's don't
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
reconcile with our campaign Finance
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
reports I've tried and I can't get
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
addendum C's and then there's another
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
piece of paper that the lobbyist has to
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
file so you've got your addendum a your
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
addendum B and then you have to file
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
this signature form so the amount of
 
01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
pieces of paper each period is pretty
 
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
repetitive and could be simplified I
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
believe um and I think there was a
 
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
committee that looked at this a couple
 
01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
of years ago um but I also think with
 
01:05:28.349 --> 01:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
our online
 
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
technology um filing these by paper
 
01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
might not be what we want to do um we
 
01:05:38.269 --> 01:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
might be able to make them fillable PDFs
 
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
and be able to submit them but currently
 
01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
the law says they have to be printed and
 
01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
hand delivered or faxed um or
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
mailed great thank you I think that did
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
answer exactly what I was trying to get
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
to um seeing no other thank you very
 
01:05:59.269 --> 01:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony um I have no
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
correct I think we're all set uh thank
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to close the
 
01:06:16.589 --> 01:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
much before I
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
close no I I am going to close uh the
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
hearing on uh House Bill

hearing on uh House Bill
1666

01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%

01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
FN be a couple minutes here and we'll
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:22.910 align:start position:0%
 
25

01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.920 --> 01:09:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh few minutes late I apologize for
 
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
that uh we'll open the hearing on um HR
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
25 couple of quick statements on this um
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
we do have a hard stop at noon time um
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
and then I'll have a couple of um
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
informational notices for the committee
 
01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
um at that point we're going to
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
rearrange some of the schedule um
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
beginning just at 12:00 or the afternoon
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
session um I would ask as we call you to
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
the witness table that uh you state your
 
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
name and the organization or whom you
 
01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:01.510 align:start position:0%
name and the organization or whom you
are

01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.030 align:start position:0%
are
representing

01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
representing
 
01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
um and whether you are for or against
 
01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
and most of that is for the um recording
 
01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
that we're doing uh
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
simultaneously um I'm going to I don't
 
01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
want to um limit the time speaking never
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
like that personally um
 
01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
but it looks to me like everyone's
 
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
asking for a reasonable amount of time
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
and it would seem that we can fit that
 
01:10:35.229 --> 01:10:35.239 align:start position:0%
into the be prior to the hard deadline
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
um please if you can concentrate on um
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
giving us new information if you agree
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
with a prior speaker simply say I agree
 
01:10:50.189 --> 01:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
with the prior speaker um rather than
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
try to uh tell us the same information
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
over and over again
 
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
um that would be helpful um I do want to
 
01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
to keep the conversation
 
01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
to the resolution itself not to any of
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
the underlying U
 
01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.950 align:start position:0%
the underlying U
issues

01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
and beyond that are there any other
 
01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
instructions that we have written
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
testimony uh I've been reminded by the
 
01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
clerk written testimony is always good
 
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
um two minutes is sometimes hard and
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
some people people uh like to prefer or
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
like to give us a written testimony that
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
does go in the file and I will uh
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
personally promise that I do read all of
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
the written
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
testimony um other than that I think
 
01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
we're good to go um the chair will
 
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
recognize the prime
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%

um you asked for three minutes welcome
 
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400 align:start position:0%

Sandra panck I'm from palum New
 
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at Hillsboro District
 
01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
1 um I want to start off by
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
reading something off my cell phone
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
um Mason's manual chapter 2 Section
 
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
7 paragraph one says that the
 
01:12:37.229 --> 01:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
Constitutions stand on a higher plane
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
than statute and as a rule are
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
mandatory there are statutes re
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
regarding election process which
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
conflict with the house with the New
 
01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.629 align:start position:0%
conflict with the house with the New
Hampshire

01:12:50.629 --> 01:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution this resolution nullifies
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
any conflicting statutes by resolving to
 
01:12:59.950 --> 01:12:59.960 align:start position:0%
return to strict
 
01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
observance if the original Law of the
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
original Law New York pistol and rifle
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
versus Bruin shows that the original Law
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
is the highest standard in America and I
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
little additional blur I want to read we
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
are a constitutional
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
republic and so we are answering then
 
01:13:23.679 --> 01:13:25.070 align:start position:0%
republic and so we are answering then
Franklin's

01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
Franklin's
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
challenge to Endeavor to keep it
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
remember we all took an oath to the New
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution as well as the
 
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
United States Constitution the day we
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
were sworn into
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
office we must all remember that our
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
rights are not just on paper but lived
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
and breath breathed every single day
 
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
oats bind the party to observe a certain
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
course of conduct or to fulfill certain
 
01:13:56.110 --> 01:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
d duties in the future or to demean
 
01:13:59.629 --> 01:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
himself thereafter in a stated manner
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
with reference to specified objects or
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
obligations this is what legislators are
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
committed to do when we take our
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
roots with regards to the towns who
 
01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
voted to use machines they are all
 
01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
creatures of the legislation legislator
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
and cannot override the law for example
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
a town no more vote to have machines
 
01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
count in their town can then they can
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
vote to ban gun ownership in their town
 
01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
if random towns could vote to override
 
01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:35.950 align:start position:0%
if random towns could vote to override
the

01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution that would be called an
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
arbitrary power the law says that
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
arbitrary power exists nowhere in a
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
republic not even in the largest
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
majority are we being viewed as
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
troublemakers because we want handcom
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
found in the pro-abortion crowd views us
 
01:14:58.709 --> 01:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
as troublemakers for wanting to stop the
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
murder of babies and yet we press on
 
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
because it is right it is simply the law
 
01:15:08.189 --> 01:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
to hand count each town will suddenly
 
01:15:11.229 --> 01:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
get very motivated to be efficient with
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
counting once they see their votes won't
 
01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
count if they don't do it by hand don't
 
01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
forget if this passes even the Democrats
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
will rally in the with the Republicans
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure they get counted on time
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
because they want their votes to count
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
just as much as we do but we have some
 
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
good suggestions too that we can make
 
01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
but the success of
 
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
hr25 resolution should be tied to the
 
01:15:44.189 --> 01:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
mere truth of defending the law not
 
01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
escaping being seen as
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
troublemakers cost analysis may be a
 
01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
helpful tool however there are some
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
legis lators who do not care how much
 
01:15:58.629 --> 01:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
the machines cost in terms of not having
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
them at all to some the ability to cheat
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
and not have to stay late counting far
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
outweighs any cost and though and for
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
those who know we don't care how
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
inexpensive they can be we want them
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
gone this is the law and it's written in
 
01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.110 align:start position:0%
gone this is the law and it's written in
our

01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
constitution the reason 640 election
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
laws suits failed is they all alleged
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
fraud which cannot be proven without
 
01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
eyewitnesses instead to claim
 
01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
maladministration not following the
 
01:16:38.189 --> 01:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
rules would have gotten us all somewhere
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
so now is our chance we keep it simple
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
the rules must be followed or the result
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
is impossible to know and
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
certify maxim of law where the law
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
prescribes a form the non observance of
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
it is fatal to the proceeding if you
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
have not heard about this resolution
 
01:17:01.629 --> 01:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand what it
 
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
means with regard to PR preservation of
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
your position if your position is
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
important to you without this resolution
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
you stand to lose your lead in the house
 
01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.229 align:start position:0%
you stand to lose your lead in the house
by

01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
2024 and possibly never regain it this
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan resolution which helps
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
Preserve our positions I will not be
 
01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
taking any questions and I will be
 
01:17:30.669 --> 01:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
handing this over to our constitutional
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
experts to answer your questions thank
 
01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:34.600 align:start position:0%

question um I'm going to break a little

bit with uh with our nor normal pattern
 
01:17:56.669 --> 01:17:56.679 align:start position:0%

01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
um our house clerk um has duties that he
 
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be somewhere else so I'd like
 
01:18:06.629 --> 01:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
to call our house clerk Paul Smith to
 
01:18:06.639 --> 01:18:08.629 align:start position:0%

quoting my favorite book Mason's manual
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
legislative procedure um I actually have
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
a couple of other sections of Mason's
 
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
manual legislative procedure that are
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
important for this discussion today uh
 
01:18:35.709 --> 01:18:35.719 align:start position:0%
again not here opposed to or in support
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
of this legislation uh merely to provide
 
01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
a few uh conceptual points number one
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen this is a house
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
resolution it has no eff of law it is
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
very important to understand this would
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
State a position of the House of
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
Representatives and the house of
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
represent resentatives only it does not
 
01:18:57.790 --> 01:18:57.800 align:start position:0%
speak for the general court therefore
 
01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
sections um contained within
 
01:19:03.629 --> 01:19:03.639 align:start position:0%
specifically in the resolving Clauses uh
 
01:19:05.189 --> 01:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
where it says resolve by the House of
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives that the general court
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
blank intends to do Etc uh again this
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
resolution does not speak for the
 
01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
general court and therefore does not
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
contain any fact of law included in it
 
01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:21.830 align:start position:0%
contain any fact of law included in it
uh

01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.510 align:start position:0%
uh
additionally

01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
um looking forward to to additional
 
01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.350 align:start position:0%
um looking forward to to additional
resolving

01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
resolving
 
01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
Clauses where it says specifically on
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
page three beginning in Roman 5 intends
 
01:19:35.709 --> 01:19:35.719 align:start position:0%
to require equivalent rigor of
 
01:19:37.149 --> 01:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
witnessing standards submitted to the
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
people's demand for equal voting rights
 
01:19:40.629 --> 01:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
to come benefit from elections and no
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
unequal classes of unqualified voters
 
01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
and and specifically requires the
 
01:19:48.669 --> 01:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to follow actions
 
01:19:51.189 --> 01:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
later we can't do that ladies and
 
01:19:53.310 --> 01:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
gentlemen that the only only way that
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
can be done is by amending law and
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
addressing that in statute or
 
01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
specifically through Constitutional
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
resolutions the section of Mason's
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
manual I I found it uh prudent to
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
discuss with you as well as many of you
 
01:20:19.629 --> 01:20:19.639 align:start position:0%
know this is a matter of adjudication
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
between uh private parties and the state
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and is currently before
 
01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court uh
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
arguments were delivered late last fall
 
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
and the Supreme Court is uh deciding
 
01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
what they're doing at this moment in
 
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
time if this was a piece of legislation
 
01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
where it would effective effectively uh
 
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
have something to do with law there's no
 
01:20:47.229 --> 01:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
issue with that but because this is a
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
resolution specifically where it talks
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
about our positions
 
01:20:56.189 --> 01:20:56.199 align:start position:0%
uh I would remind you um in section 112
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
of Mason Mason's Manual of legislative
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
procedure any matter awaiting
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
adjudication before a Judicial tribunal
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
shall not be debated or discussed in a
 
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
legislative body I want to repeat that
 
01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
again a matter awaiting adjudication
 
01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
before a Judicial tribunal shall not be
 
01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
debated or discussed in a legislative
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
body again this is different than a bill
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
this is a position statement in the form
 
01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
of a resolution and therefore I I do
 
01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
think that you you have some concerns
 
01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
that you need to address uh in how this
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
resolution is drafted uh because of of
 
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
that very
 
01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
language and I'm happy to answer any
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr cler other
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Pearson
 
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr clerk
 
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
for coming before us your uh knowledge
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.639 --> 01:21:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
unquestioned

01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
unquestioned
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
let's run this through the process it
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
passes the
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
house then what happens to it if it
 
01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
passes the house thank you for the
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
question representative as you know a
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
house resolution simply is a position of
 
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
the house nothing happens with this bill
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me this resolution because um
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
there is no instruction for the clerk to
 
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
follow uh it merely States your
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
intention however the intentions that it
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
states has requirements in it specific
 
01:22:23.669 --> 01:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
to requiring the Secretary of State to
 
01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
accomplish uh certain means that go
 
01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:29.719 align:start position:0%
beyond the authority of this one uh body
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:38.189 --> 01:22:38.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
up anyone
 
01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:43.719 align:start position:0%
else I have a quick question yes sir um
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
the section of Masons that you just
 
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
stated um do we have a problem with the
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
hearing itself um or no sir I I would
 
01:22:55.149 --> 01:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
suggest not because it is a duly filed
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation uh by a member of
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
the of the of the of the house uh
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
therefore is certainly within your
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
perview uh to take up that piece of
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
legislation I would just suggest that as
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
the matter is pending before The Supreme
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
Court of this state um that perhaps a
 
01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
decision you might want to wait for a
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
decision to come before uh reconciling
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
that through executive session later
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
this year or um potentially study the
 
01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:25.790 align:start position:0%
this year or um potentially study the
issue

01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
further okay um follow up if I if if the
 
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:33.719 align:start position:0%
the um resolution comes through the
 
01:23:36.669 --> 01:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
executive SE exec our executive session
 
01:23:41.229 --> 01:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
here and goes to the floor um does the
 
01:23:43.950 --> 01:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
debate that takes place on the floor
 
01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
have issues with
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
Masons I I think that there are some
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
concerns about what you can talk about
 
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
within the within the framework of
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
what's contained in the lawsuit
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%

01:24:01.149 --> 01:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
lawsuit thank you any you further

representative Gard Northfield Franklin

or or opposing the bill thanks yes Jason
 
01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
Gard Northville Franklin and I am
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
support of this bill I'm actually a
 
01:24:54.030 --> 01:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor this bill I misspoke I am not
 
01:24:57.149 --> 01:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor on 1666 we just heard I
 
01:24:59.390 --> 01:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
don't know how that okay we let you get
 
01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
through that one though yeah I notice
 
01:25:03.790 --> 01:25:03.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate it this as far as I'm
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
concerned this bill simply
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
reasserts things that we already hold to
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
be true if you make take an oath you
 
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
should follow it the Constitution should
 
01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:12.510 align:start position:0%
should follow it the Constitution should
be

01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
sacren because that's the rule book
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
we're following and I just want to say
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
real quickly as far as the electronic
 
01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
counting machines go and and all of that
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
it's clearly unconstitutional
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
and I I feel that more and more people
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
are losing faith in the system of voting
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
and I think that is part of what this is
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
trying to rectify because if people lose
 
01:25:34.189 --> 01:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
faith in voting then we're really headed
 
01:25:38.430 --> 01:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
down a bad road because as JFK said
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
those who make peaceful Revolution
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
impossible make violent revolution
 
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
inevitable and I I do hold that to be
 
01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
true and I think history has proven that
 
01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
to be true so I
 
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
simply think we should go back to basics
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
start following the Constitution and and
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
every vote counts especially when it's
 
01:25:56.189 --> 01:25:56.199 align:start position:0%
done by hand and not just by some
 
01:25:59.070 --> 01:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
computer we're hoping is uh doing the
 
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
right thing so that's all I wanted to
 
01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
say thank you thank you uh do you take
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
questions if we have any of course are
 
01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
gear seeing none you're off the hook
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
than thank
 
01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
you uh next pink card I have um is for
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh rep uh Penza as
 
01:26:21.199 --> 01:26:26.790 align:start position:0%
uh rep uh Penza as
well

01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
sure um but I'll I'll determine the
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:40.920 align:start position:0%

be terrific um we will I see you have

bill I am uh a former CEO uh living in
 
01:27:41.229 --> 01:27:41.239 align:start position:0%
nashv for the past 30 years uh about
 
01:27:45.229 --> 01:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
working out of DC uh where my office was
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
um so I did a lot of fly and um I I I
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
support the bill individually for my on
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
have of myself because of the tens of
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars I support
 
01:27:59.950 --> 01:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
candidates uh in the state um within the
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
past 30 years uh which is probably now
 
01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
over a couple hundred thousand dollars
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
and um one of the uh I've um uh been an
 
01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719 align:start position:0%
electronic design engineer um uh I've um
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
I have I hold two US patents with regard
 
01:28:19.629 --> 01:28:19.639 align:start position:0%
to electronic designs and frequency and
 
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
I also um have written a book with
 
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
regard to the safety of uh buildings and
 
01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
Facilities where I've taken care of a
 
01:28:28.109 --> 01:28:28.119 align:start position:0%
number of those facilities uh on Capitol
 
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
Hill uh in Boston uh with the John
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
Hancock Tower and and so on so I won't
 
01:28:37.149 --> 01:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
belabor that with you if you want my
 
01:28:39.870 --> 01:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
um uh resume I'm happy to give you my
 
01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:41.560 align:start position:0%
all 15 pages of
 
01:28:46.109 --> 01:28:46.119 align:start position:0%
it um okay um a reason I support the
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
bills because of the term legislative
 
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
intent that I've been hearing and um I
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
participate ated in a um in a recount
 
01:28:56.910 --> 01:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
election in Nashua just a couple of
 
01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
weeks ago and uh there was a number uh
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
an extremely large number of absentee
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
ballots that were used in that election
 
01:29:11.709 --> 01:29:11.719 align:start position:0%
none of which uh the the board of
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
alderman uh would want to take a look at
 
01:29:17.229 --> 01:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
with regard to the affidavit and we're
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
not talking about examining the
 
01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
signature we're talking about the
 
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
legitimacy of the affidavit itself
 
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
they refuse to hear it um but most
 
01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
importantly uh I found uh quite bizarre
 
01:29:33.229 --> 01:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
is that the this legislature passed
 
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
bills that stipulates that the um school
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
districts shall run the elections and
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
it's plain right inside the the laws but
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
yet all over the state because of the
 
01:29:48.109 --> 01:29:48.119 align:start position:0%
term legislative
 
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
intent um Board of Alderman and the city
 
01:29:54.030 --> 01:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
council are running the elections
 
01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:57.400 align:start position:0%
against what the statutes call for
 
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
statute to me was pretty clear um it's
 
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
in front of a couple of judges right now
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
who just don't really want to rule on it
 
01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
because you've been doing it for so long
 
01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:09.400 align:start position:0%
so because of the term legislative
 
01:30:11.709 --> 01:30:11.719 align:start position:0%
intent now when I see a piece of
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
legislation that says the school
 
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
district shall run the elections in this
 
01:30:19.149 --> 01:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
way and then that law is pushed aside
 
01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
because of legislative intent and
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
because of the way we've done things all
 
01:30:25.149 --> 01:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
along and they're having the school the
 
01:30:28.109 --> 01:30:28.119 align:start position:0%
um cities and towns run the elections to
 
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
me that's a problem with regard to
 
01:30:33.149 --> 01:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
education with regard to elections um
 
01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
you've opened up a Pandora box with
 
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
regard to not following what I believe
 
01:30:39.550 --> 01:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional intent is because now
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
they brought in electronic design into
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
this issue and I've had um hard surgery
 
01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
on a couple of occasions so there are
 
01:30:51.390 --> 01:30:51.400 align:start position:0%
certain frequencies I can't go up to and
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
there are fre frequencies that people
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
who are pacemakers can't go near and and
 
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about these
 
01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
particular people um they decide not to
 
01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
vote because they've been told by their
 
01:31:04.510 --> 01:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
doctors don't wear a Walkman too close
 
01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:07.400 align:start position:0%
to your your pacemaker don't go too
 
01:31:09.790 --> 01:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
close to election machines because of
 
01:31:11.950 --> 01:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
the frequency of the timing mechanism
 
01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
that's used in those machines and and so
 
01:31:18.189 --> 01:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
therefore the the way that votes used to
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
be counted um was just the way that it's
 
01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
stipulates within the Constitution all
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
of a sudden you've introduced electronic
 
01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
systems and the only way to protect from
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
those systems the legislature repealed
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
it a few years ago and made this called
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
an oosha State um and now that we're in
 
01:31:40.590 --> 01:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
oosha state with regard you see anytime
 
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
you have an electronic device it has to
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
be what's called Safety certified
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
meaning it falls under underwriter
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
Laboratories or the other 21 safety
 
01:31:52.189 --> 01:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
certification companies that do that the
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
machines that have been used in this
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
state for the past 15 years they lost
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
their certification eight years ago
 
01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
which means osia is not allowed now to
 
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
use that so when that was brought into
 
01:32:08.430 --> 01:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
court the court says well the
 
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
legislative intent says that it's
 
01:32:12.669 --> 01:32:12.679 align:start position:0%
probably okay nobody's ever brought it
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
into federal court because if they did
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
the federal court would say oh you're in
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
violation of oosha and and so when you
 
01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
try to bring it into the state court the
 
01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
state court says that's a federal issue
 
01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
and all the state has to do is just
 
01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
follow the Constitution and uh follow
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional intent of what it
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
says um uh go for the safety of the
 
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
people such as myself I mean I haven't
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
now donated to a republican cause in two
 
01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
years because of the term legislative
 
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
intent so I think the legislature uh
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
maybe starting from this committee and
 
01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying this uh to to to belittle
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
anybody but you guys need to get your
 
01:32:57.790 --> 01:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
act together um and start looking at
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
who's voting and who's not voting
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
because of electronic devices that have
 
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
been incorporated into the state that
 
01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
have now caused a potential Hazard
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
reason why o is there is not because of
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
the hazard itself it's because of the
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
potential Hazard and that's what o is
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
there for either that or go down to the
 
01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
some Electronics committee or some tell
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
them to reestablish that bill that they
 
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
repealed that way there the state canot
 
01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
take a look at the machines but I I'm
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
saying this because I'm a professional
 
01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
witness for seven different attorneys in
 
01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I've told them all
 
01:33:31.109 --> 01:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
this and they said well Wayne this is
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
too political can you just write to this
 
01:33:35.550 --> 01:33:35.560 align:start position:0%
issue or that issue because there's
 
01:33:37.229 --> 01:33:37.239 align:start position:0%
probably a problem with the legislative
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
intent of what you're saying and we
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to scare the the voters of
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
the city of the city or the state and
 
01:33:44.189 --> 01:33:44.199 align:start position:0%
I'm saying well I'm not trying to scare
 
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:46.280 align:start position:0%
anybody I'm just you know what did
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
Truman once say I'm not trying to give
 
01:33:49.709 --> 01:33:49.719 align:start position:0%
anybody hell I'm just giving you the
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
facts and it sounds like hell
 
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
so um that's all I have and if I'm happy
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%

myself in support of
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
hr25 as one of the people in part one
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
article one exercising my right to give
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
notice in instruction and demand of
 
01:35:37.149 --> 01:35:37.159 align:start position:0%
exact observance to the fundamental
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
principles of our Constitution under
 
01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
part one article 8 32 and
 
01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
38 um I'm going to get started I'm not
 
01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
sure everyone has it in hand yet but
 
01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
really one it's it's only 10 slides so
 
01:35:52.350 --> 01:35:52.360 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't take too long I wanted to
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
go over the no really go over the uh the
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
affidavit absentee issue which is
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
essentially Germain to much of the U
 
01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
much of the the resolution uh the first
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
slide is is affidavit and I'm I'm just
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
providing the definition of affidavit as
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
it exists in Black's Law which which is
 
01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
clear that it's it's something that it
 
01:36:15.070 --> 01:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be confirmed by oath sworn to
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
or or firmed uh before an officer with
 
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
authority to administer an oath uh or
 
01:36:23.790 --> 01:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
taken before an author an an officer
 
01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
having authority to administer such oath
 
01:36:28.990 --> 01:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
um in
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
1942 um you know when the amendment was
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
passed for absentee voting um the
 
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
legislature itself also had uh similar
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
definitions for what an oath was and
 
01:36:44.590 --> 01:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
they had safeguards in place requiring
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
that um an affidavit with an absentee
 
01:36:49.950 --> 01:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
ballot be sworn and so there was no
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
question about what an affidavit was
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
okay so if anyone's not clear that was
 
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
1942 and there were several safeguards
 
01:36:58.510 --> 01:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
that were put into place by the
 
01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
legislation at the time of the amendment
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
and at the time of the amendment is a
 
01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
really important concept for everyone to
 
01:37:05.709 --> 01:37:05.719 align:start position:0%
understand what did they mean when they
 
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
passed it we had statute that actually
 
01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
tells us what they meant um and those
 
01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:13.239 align:start position:0%
safeguards were really designed to make
 
01:37:16.590 --> 01:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
sure that you know the the art part one
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
article 11 which calls for an equal
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
rights to voting that we didn't have
 
01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:22.360 align:start position:0%
different class of Voters that were
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
similarly situated so we don't want to
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
have a polling place at a you know at a
 
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
at a community center where everyone has
 
01:37:32.590 --> 01:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
to go in and every movement is
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
controlled from the point that they're
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
in line to you know getting an ID to a
 
01:37:40.510 --> 01:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
blank ballot to the to the to the to the
 
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
Privacy Booth all the way through the um
 
01:37:45.070 --> 01:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
you know to when they insert it into a
 
01:37:47.709 --> 01:37:47.719 align:start position:0%
machine or put it into a Ballot Box okay
 
01:37:49.390 --> 01:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
all those movements are controlled by
 
01:37:51.589 --> 01:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
Statute as opposed to the absente
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
process which once somebody has a blank
 
01:37:55.229 --> 01:37:55.239 align:start position:0%
ballot they can do anything they want
 
01:37:57.589 --> 01:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
with it they can traffic it they can
 
01:38:00.109 --> 01:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
they can be electioneered um they can
 
01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:01.719 align:start position:0%
you know pretty much have somebody else
 
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
sign it for them because no one's
 
01:38:05.070 --> 01:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
checking so this there's quite a big
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
distinction in the way people are
 
01:38:09.629 --> 01:38:09.639 align:start position:0%
treated at that 1942 they recognized
 
01:38:12.070 --> 01:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
safeguards you know needed to be very
 
01:38:13.629 --> 01:38:13.639 align:start position:0%
similar and we just don't have that
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
anymore 1979 it was thrown
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
out so I'm going to move on to um I
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
think I just really said why affidavits
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
are required so further down in the in
 
01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
the presentation I've provided for uh an
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
RSA that we currently have on the books
 
01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:32.629 align:start position:0%
RSA that we currently have on the books
um

01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
65717 and this is really where it we are
 
01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
you know telling um the voter uh who has
 
01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:41.320 align:start position:0%
an AB absentee ballot uh what they have
 
01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
to do they have to execute the affidavit
 
01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
right and in
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
6593 we have a definition know statutes
 
01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
have def definitions we we have an 6
 
01:38:55.629 --> 01:38:55.639 align:start position:0%
5930 says that uh an affidavit must be
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
sworn again going back to just like
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
black law and what existed back in 1942
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
still currently on the books we have to
 
01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
execute an affidavit and we Define that
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's got to be done you know in front of
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
somebody who is qualified to administer
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
an oath so what happened
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
1979 we passed the that's this one right
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
here it's gray okay
 
01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
1979 it appears that the legislature
 
01:39:25.229 --> 01:39:25.239 align:start position:0%
decided to cut off the part where the
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
affidavit execution piece is
 
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
required and that's why we have this
 
01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
house resolution okay how can we
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
possibly swear to something in front of
 
01:39:38.990 --> 01:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
someone who needs who's qualified to
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
administer an oath if it's not on the
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
envelope so believe it or not I'm almost
 
01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
done um the the
 
01:39:49.589 --> 01:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
6577 which is the affidavit envelope is
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
not an affidavit it's an affidavit
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
velope legislature cannot just change a
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
a label of something and call it an
 
01:39:58.149 --> 01:39:58.159 align:start position:0%
affidavit because they want to okay it's
 
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
a self-certification it's
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
meaningless okay um I'm going to leave
 
01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
this slide because I think somebody else
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
is going to speak speak to whether or
 
01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
not legislature can change the intent of
 
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
the Constitution so we can skip
 
01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
that okay and I'm going to briefly
 
01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
discuss another element of absentee
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
ballot uh the absentee ballot which is
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
you know whether or not we the legisl
 
01:40:26.189 --> 01:40:26.199 align:start position:0%
can simply add religious employment care
 
01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
of children in the infirmed or whether
 
01:40:32.270 --> 01:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
as reasons for um allowing somebody to
 
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
have an absentee ballot you know we are
 
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
very explicit in article 11 part one
 
01:40:38.990 --> 01:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
article 11 it's absent from the city or
 
01:40:40.750 --> 01:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
town which they are
 
01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
inhabitants there's no it's clearly a
 
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
geographical issue where you live if
 
01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
you're not there you can have an
 
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot or physical disability
 
01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
that is defined back in 1942 as a doctor
 
01:40:56.109 --> 01:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
a physician they have to certify that
 
01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
you're actually physically disabled when
 
01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
we add things you know that's violating
 
01:41:03.070 --> 01:41:03.080 align:start position:0%
a maximum of law the inclusion of one is
 
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
is to the exclusion of another the
 
01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
certain designation of one person is an
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
absolute exclusion of all others yet the
 
01:41:11.070 --> 01:41:11.080 align:start position:0%
legislature did
 
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
it finally my final remarks are and I
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
think it was briefly mentioned and I
 
01:41:17.470 --> 01:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
agree with the gentleman that spoke
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
before me where he said that you know
 
01:41:23.629 --> 01:41:23.639 align:start position:0%
these these uh moderators had uh um they
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
had un um they had uncertified absentee
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
ballot envelopes and you know the the
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
moderator is only allowed to remove the
 
01:41:34.189 --> 01:41:34.199 align:start position:0%
ballot from the envelope if he can show
 
01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
that it's been certified none of these
 
01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
have been certified I don't know how
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
many were Nash but I'm thinking
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
Statewide and I'm thinking about prior
 
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
elections where the the rates of
 
01:41:46.229 --> 01:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
absentee balloting went way up they
 
01:41:47.709 --> 01:41:47.719 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed to like
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
32% how many of these have been
 
01:41:51.149 --> 01:41:51.159 align:start position:0%
certified and included in the the ballot
 
01:41:53.629 --> 01:41:53.639 align:start position:0%
stream think about that so just in
 
01:41:55.390 --> 01:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
closing I just I would appreciate that
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
this committee if they're going to take
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
up any rebuttal to anything that I put
 
01:42:01.229 --> 01:42:01.239 align:start position:0%
here which has been submitted already to
 
01:42:03.870 --> 01:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
the record uh through the website um
 
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
that you you know that you uh share uh
 
01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
any dialogue and especially if if you
 
01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
could do it in written format I'd
 
01:42:12.149 --> 01:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate it because I think that no
 
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
one has been able to rebut any of this
 
01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
information to this
 
01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
point and thank the Lord for having me
 
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
here thank you appreciate it um are you
 
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
open to taking questions if there are I
 
01:42:25.589 --> 01:42:25.599 align:start position:0%

01:42:30.109 --> 01:42:30.119 align:start position:0%

01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%

house resolution I understand there's a
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
lot of uh conflicting opinion on it but
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
I can clearly see yours um a question
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
for you was something you you you uh
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
made me think about with regards to this
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
presentation it's obviously you put some
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
time into uh creating a PowerPoint about
 
01:43:00.350 --> 01:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
this have you approach the Secretary of
 
01:43:03.629 --> 01:43:03.639 align:start position:0%
State's office with regards to the
 
01:43:05.470 --> 01:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
information contained in this
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
presentation yeah actually um I along
 
01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
with a lot of others served um a lawful
 
01:43:14.990 --> 01:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
notice to the Secretary of State and um
 
01:43:17.790 --> 01:43:17.800 align:start position:0%

other Representatives as well so um he's
 
01:43:26.109 --> 01:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
very aware of the issue and I think he
 
01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
was made aware of the issue before we
 
01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
just did a lawful notice and we met with
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:37.229 --> 01:43:37.239 align:start position:0%
December has he responded in any way or
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
rebutted the information in any regard
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
um well during during the meeting he he
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
debated a few of the points and um his
 
01:43:47.629 --> 01:43:47.639 align:start position:0%
response was that he thought he was um
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
that he believed that he was acting
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
within the Constitution to the best of
 
01:43:54.629 --> 01:43:54.639 align:start position:0%
his ability um but we did ask him to put
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
it in writing and he said he could not
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
um and he has been to to this point
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
unable to rebut anything we've said zero
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%

01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
late to the party I was at someplace
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
else but in any case uh house resolution
 
01:45:12.430 --> 01:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
that we have before us right now that
 
01:45:15.550 --> 01:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
you talking to do you believe this
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
will if we could get it to pass will it
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
solve the problem or we have to do
 
01:45:23.669 --> 01:45:23.679 align:start position:0%
further something further to resolve
 
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
this affida problem because I agree with
 
01:45:27.950 --> 01:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
you in my time we went from 50 uh
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
absentee voters to 500 when Co hit and
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
then that was just to me it was
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
phenomenal so I I just want your opinion
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
on that well my my opinion is that the
 
01:45:40.990 --> 01:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
um a resolution is an acknowledgement of
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
the notice that we're providing today so
 
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
I think that goes a long way in terms of
 
01:45:48.589 --> 01:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
um you know starting the process do I
 
01:45:50.189 --> 01:45:50.199 align:start position:0%
think it's going to resolve everything
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
no I think it's a down payment but
 
01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
certainly if there are things that can
 
01:45:57.149 --> 01:45:57.159 align:start position:0%
make some of these statutes which are
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
not you know do not come before The
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution if they can void make them
 
01:46:03.589 --> 01:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
acknowledge they already are void in my
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
opinion because they're repugnant to
 
01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
what the Constitution says so it's more
 
01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
or less a formality at this point as to
 
01:46:11.910 --> 01:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
how the legislature follows through and
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
makes that you know uh generally
 
01:46:15.790 --> 01:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
accepted amongst the public in
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
themselves so I yeah we if we've already
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
gone to the ex a branch and you know
 
01:46:24.270 --> 01:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
they're ignoring us uh the legislature
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
ignores us and you know perhaps I I
 
01:46:28.470 --> 01:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
heard mention that you know there's a
 
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
there's a individual rights case on this
 
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
issue with the Supreme Court okay so
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's all three branches of government
 
01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
if we can't get this
 
01:46:39.070 --> 01:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
resolved where are we we're doing
 
01:46:40.830 --> 01:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
everything we can peacefully all three
 
01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
branches of government are going to
 
01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:46.719 align:start position:0%
ignore it we can't do that anymore I'm
 
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
afraid that the you know there is there
 
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
is actually an instruction in the
 
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution as to what happens when all
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
three branches of government ignore you
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's not a good
 
01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.159 align:start position:0%
result thank
 
01:47:01.629 --> 01:47:01.639 align:start position:0%
you any further questions seeing none
 
01:47:02.990 --> 01:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:14.910 --> 01:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
there we'll go here uh chair recognizes
 
01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:21.709 align:start position:0%
there we'll go here uh chair recognizes
Andrew

01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
Andrew
 
01:47:21.719 --> 01:47:25.390 align:start position:0%
Andrew
noise

01:47:25.390 --> 01:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
um two
 
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
bill welcome to legislative
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
Administration thank you good morning my
 
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
name is Andrew noise I am in support of
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
this resolution I'm one of the people
 
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
coming of my own right I'm not
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:51.310 --> 01:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
group the input from the clerk
 
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
um was a bit telling but frankly I think
 
01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
that his statement actually contradicted
 
01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
itself and that is the primary source of
 
01:48:04.589 --> 01:48:04.599 align:start position:0%
Authority for everything that's going to
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
be discussed in this room and here in
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
this city is the
 
01:48:14.910 --> 01:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution and so while Masons May
 
01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:17.320 align:start position:0%
State one way or another what should or
 
01:48:19.709 --> 01:48:19.719 align:start position:0%
should not be discussed when there's an
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
individual rights case the fact still
 
01:48:24.149 --> 01:48:24.159 align:start position:0%
stands that the constitution says what
 
01:48:26.430 --> 01:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
it says and has said so for quite some
 
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
time and this resolution is
 
01:48:31.629 --> 01:48:31.639 align:start position:0%
simply calling the
 
01:48:35.149 --> 01:48:35.159 align:start position:0%
legislature back to that and that is in
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
part one article 11 and part two article
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
32 it's very plainly
 
01:48:44.350 --> 01:48:44.360 align:start position:0%
stated uh what the requirements are for
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
a lawful election and so whatever is
 
01:48:47.119 --> 01:48:48.430 align:start position:0%
a lawful election and so whatever is
debated

01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
debated
 
01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
here it really doesn't matter matter if
 
01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't comport to the Constitution I
 
01:48:55.229 --> 01:48:55.239 align:start position:0%
think that we all would agree that if
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
there was a matter before the courts
 
01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
about the constitutionality of murder
 
01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
and there was murder happening out in
 
01:49:04.189 --> 01:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
those streets that it wouldn't it
 
01:49:07.470 --> 01:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't matter what the resolution did
 
01:49:09.070 --> 01:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
or didn't say if it said the
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution very plainly says that the
 
01:49:12.669 --> 01:49:12.679 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire have a right to
 
01:49:15.149 --> 01:49:15.159 align:start position:0%
life then we have to go stop that and
 
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
whatever was granted to the legislature
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:27.550 --> 01:49:27.560 align:start position:0%
yest part two article 32 very plainly
 
01:49:31.510 --> 01:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
states the requirements for human
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
eyewitnesses to observe and count the
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
votes the leap from that to a machine
 
01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
and one of the prior gentlemen uh went
 
01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
into detail about some of some of the
 
01:49:46.510 --> 01:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
the inw workings of those machines the
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
leap to a complex machine is very far
 
01:49:53.589 --> 01:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
are from the human eyewitnesses and it's
 
01:49:55.470 --> 01:49:55.480 align:start position:0%
not the job of the legislature it's not
 
01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679 align:start position:0%
the job of any executive or judicial
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
members to decide that that human
 
01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
eyewitness now means a
 
01:50:09.310 --> 01:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
machine um frankly I think it's it's
 
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
kind of ridiculous and I think that
 
01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room needs to remember
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
that the testimony from the clerk
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
earlier was referring to Mason's manual
 
01:50:19.679 --> 01:50:21.149 align:start position:0%
earlier was referring to Mason's manual
which

01:50:21.149 --> 01:50:21.159 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:50:23.070 --> 01:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
says that the constitution stands on a
 
01:50:25.149 --> 01:50:25.159 align:start position:0%
higher plane which of course comports
 
01:50:27.709 --> 01:50:27.719 align:start position:0%
with legislative procedure to consider
 
01:50:30.629 --> 01:50:30.639 align:start position:0%
the Constitution before anything
 
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
else to ask this simple question does
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
part one article 11 and part two article
 
01:50:38.189 --> 01:50:38.199 align:start position:0%
32 excuse
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
me clearly State the human
 
01:50:45.669 --> 01:50:45.679 align:start position:0%
requirements for conducting an
 
01:50:48.430 --> 01:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
election if so the the question has
 
01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
already been answered then and the
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
matters set forth in this resolution are
 
01:50:55.550 --> 01:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
really self-explanatory and and need to
 
01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
be acted on
 
01:51:00.109 --> 01:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
immediately that's
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
all thank you for your testimony would
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
you be willing to take questions if
 
01:51:08.510 --> 01:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
there are any yes are there
 
01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
any rep
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
Pearson it's a two-parter because it
 
01:51:15.550 --> 01:51:15.560 align:start position:0%
requires a let's start with the first
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
one do you know where the largest
 
01:51:18.189 --> 01:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
polling place in the United States is
 
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
single polling place
 
01:51:24.510 --> 01:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
it's in Derry my
 
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
district we have
 
01:51:30.990 --> 01:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:34.069 --> 01:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
voters what happens if I can't get
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
people to hand
 
01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
count my ballots are my constituents now
 
01:51:44.229 --> 01:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
not afforded their right to vote and
 
01:51:48.109 --> 01:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
counted again again I think think that
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
the that the question is avoiding the
 
01:51:58.669 --> 01:51:58.679 align:start position:0%
initial imperative and obligation that
 
01:52:02.430 --> 01:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
you have as a representative to lawfully
 
01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
carry out elections though though we are
 
01:52:06.589 --> 01:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
you're not answering my question you're
 
01:52:08.910 --> 01:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
not answering my question I am answering
 
01:52:11.149 --> 01:52:11.159 align:start position:0%
your question though because you swore
 
01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
an oath to the Constitution of the State
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire which clearly states
 
01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:17.510 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire which clearly states
the

01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:19.629 --> 01:52:19.639 align:start position:0%
requirements electronic voting machines
 
01:52:21.390 --> 01:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
are not those requirements if we want to
 
01:52:23.790 --> 01:52:23.800 align:start position:0%
amend the Constitution everybody in this
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
room I assume knows the simple lawful
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
means to do that but as it stands now
 
01:52:33.709 --> 01:52:33.719 align:start position:0%
the Constitution plainly
 
01:52:36.430 --> 01:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
states how those are to be counted so
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
while we are all of course sympathetic
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
to the fact that that might take more
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
work you have to figure that out and you
 
01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
can discuss how you're going to have
 
01:52:51.669 --> 01:52:51.679 align:start position:0%
those double the amount of in places get
 
01:52:54.990 --> 01:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
more eyes are they have to be human eyes
 
01:52:57.629 --> 01:52:57.639 align:start position:0%
if you want to if you want to talk about
 
01:53:00.550 --> 01:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
the expediency of the process that has
 
01:53:03.229 --> 01:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
to occur within the lawful
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional bounds placed on you as a
 
01:53:08.910 --> 01:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
representative so as far as whether
 
01:53:12.149 --> 01:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
those count they must count again part
 
01:53:14.589 --> 01:53:14.599 align:start position:0%
one article 11 clearly states that they
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
have to be count and that the people
 
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
have a right to be represented through
 
01:53:20.589 --> 01:53:20.599 align:start position:0%
their vote
 
01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
but as far as the burden on on on those
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
workers in
 
01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
Dairy while sympathetic to it you you
 
01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
have to figure out how to do that in the
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
lawful bounds set forth in the
 
01:53:38.990 --> 01:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution so so what happens to to
 
01:53:41.790 --> 01:53:41.800 align:start position:0%
answer it directly in a nutshell what
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
happens is you figure
 
01:53:47.470 --> 01:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
out how to count those votes by hand
 
01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
though it may take a long time the
 
01:53:52.270 --> 01:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
representatives and the individual
 
01:53:54.109 --> 01:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
officers and
 
01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
clerks who swear and oath to do this job
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
have to know that sometimes it's it's
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
going to be hard work that cannot ever
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:13.069 --> 01:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
says thank you any other questions
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.679 --> 01:54:20.669 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:54:20.669 --> 01:54:20.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:54:22.149 --> 01:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
I see a similar
 
01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
name Christopher
 
01:54:30.189 --> 01:54:30.199 align:start position:0%
noise similar Town similar amount of
 
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
noise uh six welcome to legislative
 
01:54:47.950 --> 01:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
Administration thank you Mr chair
 
01:54:51.629 --> 01:54:51.639 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
he was asking if he could go last is
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
that possible
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
um it we have we have these laid out the
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
way we're going thank you sorry about
 
01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
that I didn't hear you did you ask me
 
01:55:08.830 --> 01:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
that oh no I did not hear that
 
01:55:13.229 --> 01:55:13.239 align:start position:0%
sorry Mr noise yes so my name is Chris
 
01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
noise I am residing in Bethlehem New
 
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm just here as one of
 
01:55:22.950 --> 01:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
the people to speak to the issue um I
 
01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
support the
 
01:55:28.189 --> 01:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
essentially um oh let me back up and say
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
that it's my understanding that a
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
resolution operates similar to a bill if
 
01:55:38.430 --> 01:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
it were to pass the house it would need
 
01:55:40.830 --> 01:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
to pass the Senate and the governor
 
01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
would have to sign off on it in order
 
01:55:44.669 --> 01:55:44.679 align:start position:0%
for it to be binding but at that point
 
01:55:48.189 --> 01:55:48.199 align:start position:0%
it is binding every bit is binding as a
 
01:55:52.109 --> 01:55:52.119 align:start position:0%
bill so these claims that the resolution
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
is meaningless or non-binding or just a
 
01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
virtue signal um I don't see any written
 
01:55:59.430 --> 01:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
evidence of that
 
01:56:02.270 --> 01:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere uh so I disagree with that so I
 
01:56:04.830 --> 01:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
do believe that it's worth trying to
 
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
walk through the process just like a
 
01:56:08.350 --> 01:56:08.360 align:start position:0%
bill the reason why it's better than a
 
01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
01:56:14.189 --> 01:56:14.199 align:start position:0%
because bills add on layers of statutes
 
01:56:17.669 --> 01:56:17.679 align:start position:0%
to the fundamental law and that has what
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
is exactly what has gotten us into the J
 
01:56:21.870 --> 01:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
we're in now and so this resolution
 
01:56:24.109 --> 01:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
rather than attempt to add more layers
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
of peels to the
 
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
onion strips away all the statute which
 
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
is in Conflict currently with the
 
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:37.149 align:start position:0%
 
Constitution

01:56:37.149 --> 01:56:37.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
01:56:37.159 --> 01:56:39.430 align:start position:0%
Constitution
so

01:56:39.430 --> 01:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:41.189 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
the the the aspect of the human
 
01:56:45.669 --> 01:56:45.679 align:start position:0%
eyewitness has been brought up and the
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
reason why that's important is because
 
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
if there's to be a challenge
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
to the count in the election and
 
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
somebody would like to take that to
 
01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
court for
 
01:56:59.550 --> 01:56:59.560 align:start position:0%
instance two or more eyewitnesses are
 
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
required to establish a fact in law and
 
01:57:06.109 --> 01:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
the Machine precludes that ability for
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
the humans to do that so the founding
 
01:57:10.229 --> 01:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
generation they understood that they
 
01:57:11.589 --> 01:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
understood law very well and they
 
01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
understood that two or more eyewitnesses
 
01:57:15.790 --> 01:57:15.800 align:start position:0%
are required to establish a fact in law
 
01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
so they placed the clerk the moderator
 
01:57:20.350 --> 01:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
and a select board
 
01:57:22.030 --> 01:57:22.040 align:start position:0%
witnessing with their own eyes the
 
01:57:24.149 --> 01:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
sorting and Counting of the
 
01:57:27.189 --> 01:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
ballots the benefit of that is like I
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
said if there's a challenge to the vote
 
01:57:32.189 --> 01:57:32.199 align:start position:0%
any one of those humans can be placed
 
01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
under penalty of perjury put on the
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
stand and ask to testify and they have
 
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
the fear of the law in them to know that
 
01:57:41.790 --> 01:57:41.800 align:start position:0%
if they're caught lying they could spend
 
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
time in prison a machine though it may
 
01:57:47.629 --> 01:57:47.639 align:start position:0%
be able to count and sort as well as a
 
01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
human being does not have the ability to
 
01:57:52.069 --> 01:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
get on a on a witness stand and testify
 
01:57:54.270 --> 01:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
to what it has seen nor is it afraid of
 
01:57:55.870 --> 01:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
spending time in jail I think that's
 
01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
pretty ludicrous
 
01:57:59.589 --> 01:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
right um
 
01:58:02.750 --> 01:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
so the the other aspect to this is that
 
01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:04.470 align:start position:0%
so the the other aspect to this is that
the

01:58:04.470 --> 01:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
legislature um is not granted Authority
 
01:58:09.149 --> 01:58:09.159 align:start position:0%
anywhere that I can find in part two
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
frame of government to amend or alter a
 
01:58:16.149 --> 01:58:16.159 align:start position:0%
constitutional provision the only lawful
 
01:58:18.069 --> 01:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
way to amend or alter a constitutional
 
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
provision is through part to article 100
 
01:58:23.229 --> 01:58:23.239 align:start position:0%
um at a banal election where the
 
01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
proposal is made to the people and the
 
01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
majority of the people vote whether they
 
01:58:29.910 --> 01:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
agree or disagree with an alteration to
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
the amendment as it stands Today part
 
01:58:34.990 --> 01:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
two article 32 for instance has never
 
01:58:38.229 --> 01:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
been amended by the people so all
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
Alterations by legislature are
 
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
unauthorized null and
 
01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:45.430 align:start position:0%
unauthorized null and
void

01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
void
 
01:58:50.189 --> 01:58:50.199 align:start position:0%
um as to the affidavit
 
01:58:51.910 --> 01:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
um that was covered briefly and the part
 
01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
that I think I would like to fill in
 
01:58:57.629 --> 01:58:57.639 align:start position:0%
there is the very definition of anavit
 
01:59:00.350 --> 01:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
as seen in Blacks Law Dictionary shows a
 
01:59:04.069 --> 01:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
sworn officer of the Court verifying the
 
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
identity of the
 
01:59:11.550 --> 01:59:11.560 align:start position:0%
voter um and also uh shows the the sworn
 
01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
officer of the Court verifying the
 
01:59:14.910 --> 01:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
identity of the person who comes before
 
01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:16.470 align:start position:0%
identity of the person who comes before
them

01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
well the current situation with
 
01:59:20.830 --> 01:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
affidavits cuz I was at that meeting
 
01:59:23.149 --> 01:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
with the secretary of state and I posed
 
01:59:26.350 --> 01:59:26.360 align:start position:0%
to him this this understanding that the
 
01:59:28.950 --> 01:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
affidavit needs to be conducted in front
 
01:59:30.990 --> 01:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
of a sworn notary of the Court that's
 
01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
the whole point of it is to author is to
 
01:59:36.069 --> 01:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
verify the authentic the uh identity of
 
01:59:38.350 --> 01:59:38.360 align:start position:0%
the voter and also the statute calls for
 
01:59:40.109 --> 01:59:40.119 align:start position:0%
them to witness the voter filling out
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
the ballot um and the Secretary of State
 
01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
replied to me well the voter can sign on
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
the on the affidavit themselves
 
01:59:50.069 --> 01:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
self-certifying that they are who they
 
01:59:51.910 --> 01:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
say they are and send it in but that
 
01:59:53.950 --> 01:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
defies the very definition in Black's
 
01:59:56.430 --> 01:59:56.440 align:start position:0%
Law Dictionary fourth edition of what an
 
01:59:58.669 --> 01:59:58.679 align:start position:0%
affidavit is so there's a clear
 
01:59:58.679 --> 02:00:00.189 align:start position:0%
affidavit is so there's a clear
deficiency

02:00:00.189 --> 02:00:00.199 align:start position:0%
deficiency
 
02:00:00.199 --> 02:00:04.550 align:start position:0%
deficiency
there

02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
um let's
 
02:00:09.229 --> 02:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
see what else do I need to speak
 
02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:11.639 align:start position:0%
to I had wanted to go last so I could
 
02:00:16.350 --> 02:00:16.360 align:start position:0%
kind of tie up any loose send but um
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any
 
02:00:20.310 --> 02:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
questions okay well I'll speak to I'll
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
speak to convenience like as as Andrew
 
02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
Noy said my son I'm very proud of him um
 
02:00:29.069 --> 02:00:29.079 align:start position:0%
as he so apply stated um convenience
 
02:00:31.709 --> 02:00:31.719 align:start position:0%
cannot be a consideration when each one
 
02:00:33.870 --> 02:00:33.880 align:start position:0%
of you already promised in advance by
 
02:00:37.310 --> 02:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
way of oath part two article 84 says you
 
02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
accepted the trust and the New Hampshire
 
02:00:41.550 --> 02:00:41.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution is a trust IND denture we
 
02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
are the gr tours you are the trust these
 
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
you already promised us that you would
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
fulfill the contractual terms
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if you're all aware that
 
02:00:52.750 --> 02:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
it's an actual contract like in Vermont
 
02:00:56.510 --> 02:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
part one article six actually says all
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
government agents are the people's
 
02:00:59.350 --> 02:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
trustees and accountable to them in a
 
02:01:01.990 --> 02:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
legal way so you already promised to us
 
02:01:03.790 --> 02:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
contractually that you would fulfill the
 
02:01:07.149 --> 02:01:07.159 align:start position:0%
exact terms of the contract now in an
 
02:01:08.910 --> 02:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
Express trust contract only what is
 
02:01:11.189 --> 02:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
expressly written is authorized or
 
02:01:13.390 --> 02:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
granted Authority and what is not is
 
02:01:15.189 --> 02:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
expressly written is not authorized for
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
example let's say I have a trust fund
 
02:01:18.430 --> 02:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
and I invite you to be one of my
 
02:01:20.589 --> 02:01:20.599 align:start position:0%
trustees to identify cash flowing real
 
02:01:22.669 --> 02:01:22.679 align:start position:0%
estate properties and I offer you $2,000
 
02:01:24.990 --> 02:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
compensation for each one you find and
 
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
you agree to be one of my trustees and
 
02:01:28.589 --> 02:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
you come into contract with me one day a
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
month down the road we're having coffee
 
02:01:31.390 --> 02:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
and you show up in a Ferrari and I say
 
02:01:32.629 --> 02:01:32.639 align:start position:0%
that's a beautiful car where'd you get
 
02:01:33.790 --> 02:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
the money and you say well I bought it
 
02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
with the trust fund money helps me get
 
02:01:37.069 --> 02:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
to the rental estate real estate
 
02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
properties to buy them quicker for you
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
and I say well where does it say in the
 
02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
trust that you could do that and you
 
02:01:47.310 --> 02:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
said if you replied to me it doesn't say
 
02:01:49.069 --> 02:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
I couldn't do it I think you could you
 
02:01:50.430 --> 02:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
can see we'd have a problem and that in
 
02:01:52.510 --> 02:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
court of law you would be held
 
02:01:54.629 --> 02:01:54.639 align:start position:0%
responsible for your fiduciary duty well
 
02:01:56.750 --> 02:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire Constitution part 232
 
02:01:59.470 --> 02:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
it shows three human beings sorting and
 
02:02:01.589 --> 02:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
Counting the votes and it doesn't say
 
02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
anywhere in there that you can add in a
 
02:02:06.430 --> 02:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
monkey counting them on the moon you can
 
02:02:07.870 --> 02:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
no more add a monkey counting them on
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
the moon than you can add a machine you
 
02:02:11.870 --> 02:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
don't have that Authority so all along
 
02:02:13.830 --> 02:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
this whole time the machines have been
 
02:02:15.870 --> 02:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
unauthorized you promised us that you
 
02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
would do it exactly the way it says in
 
02:02:19.950 --> 02:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
part two article 32
 
02:02:22.589 --> 02:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
and this resolution would strip away
 
02:02:23.629 --> 02:02:23.639 align:start position:0%
those statutes which you were
 
02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
unauthorized to make bring us back to
 
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
the original operating principle where
 
02:02:28.950 --> 02:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
we would have our eyewitnesses if we
 
02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
need them to testify in court to any
 
02:02:34.709 --> 02:02:34.719 align:start position:0%
miscount or Tom
 
02:02:37.950 --> 02:02:37.960 align:start position:0%
Foolery um
 
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
and as far as the convenience factor um
 
02:02:45.310 --> 02:02:45.320 align:start position:0%
as representative mcarter has said
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
that's actually the job of the
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
legislature is to figure out that type
 
02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
of detail and you can write statute for
 
02:02:52.350 --> 02:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
how many polling stations you would be I
 
02:02:54.550 --> 02:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
mean a very practical solution would be
 
02:02:56.589 --> 02:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
to double the amount of polling stations
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
and have enough workers in there to to
 
02:03:01.149 --> 02:03:01.159 align:start position:0%
count the votes so you could take that
 
02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
18,000 however many votes are counted in
 
02:03:06.189 --> 02:03:06.199 align:start position:0%
each one you could take that down um
 
02:03:08.270 --> 02:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
that's just a practical I'm not saying
 
02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
that is the solution but I think it's
 
02:03:11.669 --> 02:03:11.679 align:start position:0%
just to show that it'd be pretty easy to
 
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
probably come up with a
 
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
solution um but once again convenience
 
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
can never be used as an excuse to not
 
02:03:20.750 --> 02:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
follow the law that you already promised
 
02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:23.109 align:start position:0%
follow the law that you already promised
to

02:03:23.109 --> 02:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
follow thank you thank you we're proud
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
of your son as
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
well um Mr chair I just want to a point
 
02:03:34.069 --> 02:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
of clarification here because it's now
 
02:03:36.149 --> 02:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
been stated three
 
02:03:38.830 --> 02:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
times that this statements are being
 
02:03:40.589 --> 02:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
made that this is like a
 
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
bill and this is a non-actionable house
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
resolution and I think we're getting
 
02:03:51.310 --> 02:03:51.320 align:start position:0%
away from the that that that clear fact
 
02:03:56.189 --> 02:03:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:01.629 --> 02:04:01.639 align:start position:0%
you chair recognizes uh Daniel
 
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
Richard indicates 10 minutes be nice if
 
02:04:08.109 --> 02:04:08.119 align:start position:0%
it was less than that um supports the
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
bill and has written testimony I
 
02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
have welcome Mr Richard thank you ladies
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
and gentlemen of the committee it's my
 
02:04:18.069 --> 02:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
honor to be here today um my name is
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
Daniel Richard I'm citizen of New
 
02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representing myself on uh and
 
02:04:25.149 --> 02:04:25.159 align:start position:0%
I'm for this bill or this resolution
 
02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to speak to you today is
 
02:04:28.430 --> 02:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh something different that what
 
02:04:30.669 --> 02:04:30.679 align:start position:0%
everyone else has talked about so let me
 
02:04:33.030 --> 02:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
begin with um I'm a constitutional
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
scholar and I'm here today to share with
 
02:04:36.430 --> 02:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
this committee the relevant and recent
 
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
decisions of the state supreme court and
 
02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court of the United States
 
02:04:42.149 --> 02:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
and how these cases will affect this
 
02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
legislature moving forward I believe the
 
02:04:46.470 --> 02:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
subject matter raised by the recent
 
02:04:48.189 --> 02:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
court rulings are not only important
 
02:04:50.109 --> 02:04:50.119 align:start position:0%
because they affect the making of law by
 
02:04:52.549 --> 02:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
this legislature over those specific
 
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
subjects but also because it affects the
 
02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
way the legislature must act in the
 
02:04:59.229 --> 02:04:59.239 align:start position:0%
future in all legislative
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
matters those excuse me those cases
 
02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
include the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
02:05:04.990 --> 02:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
recently decided in Brown versus
 
02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State over the
 
02:05:08.430 --> 02:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
redistricting fight which cites the
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
recent Supreme Court decision in morvi
 
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
Harper decided in June of this year and
 
02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's really the heart of what I want
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
to get into because it has a dramatic
 
02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
effect on all 50
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
states and it was over the redistricting
 
02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
conflict morvi Harper is not just about
 
02:05:24.310 --> 02:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
how election laws must be written but
 
02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:26.719 align:start position:0%
morvi Harper also addresses the rules
 
02:05:29.149 --> 02:05:29.159 align:start position:0%
now controlling judicial review by the
 
02:05:31.069 --> 02:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
state and federal courts which now
 
02:05:34.069 --> 02:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
affects all 50 states the other recent
 
02:05:35.589 --> 02:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
cases are the two Federal Second
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment cases the District of Columbia
 
02:05:39.870 --> 02:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
versus heler and New York State Rifle
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
and Pistol Association versus bruan in
 
02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
2002 both cases have corrected the
 
02:05:48.430 --> 02:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
standard of of review which now must be
 
02:05:50.109 --> 02:05:50.119 align:start position:0%
used used in all the courts including
 
02:05:51.069 --> 02:05:51.079 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:05:53.149 --> 02:05:53.159 align:start position:0%
legislature when all of your federal
 
02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
protected rights are implicated the
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
plain text and that's what this court
 
02:05:58.950 --> 02:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
the Second Amendment cases were all
 
02:06:01.870 --> 02:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
about as soon as the plain text of the
 
02:06:03.549 --> 02:06:03.559 align:start position:0%
any legislative act that you go to move
 
02:06:06.310 --> 02:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
forward if it imp implicates any one of
 
02:06:08.910 --> 02:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
your enumerated Federal rights you now
 
02:06:10.669 --> 02:06:10.679 align:start position:0%
have to prove the burden of proof shifts
 
02:06:12.430 --> 02:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
to the government and that's a radical
 
02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
departure from past uh be past standards
 
02:06:19.149 --> 02:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
of review where the uh the move party
 
02:06:20.549 --> 02:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
would have to prove standing in the
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
court and so that's that deals
 
02:06:24.430 --> 02:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
specifically those cases dealt
 
02:06:27.669 --> 02:06:27.679 align:start position:0%
specifically with the Second Amendment
 
02:06:30.910 --> 02:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
but what happened in bruan excuse me
 
02:06:32.950 --> 02:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
what happened in the bruan decision is
 
02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:34.510 align:start position:0%
what happened in the bruan decision is
that

02:06:34.510 --> 02:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
the uh the court because the lower
 
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
courts were not getting the Second
 
02:06:41.109 --> 02:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment case from DC correct they were
 
02:06:43.030 --> 02:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
not applying the proper standard or
 
02:06:45.950 --> 02:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
review heler clarified it heler went on
 
02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
to say that any time you're dealing with
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
any any one of your ferally protected
 
02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
rights that's any of them this standard
 
02:06:55.549 --> 02:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
of review now applies so this is
 
02:06:57.390 --> 02:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
important from a legislative perspective
 
02:06:58.990 --> 02:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
and within the body of this committee
 
02:07:01.709 --> 02:07:01.719 align:start position:0%
you now have oversight as to how your
 
02:07:02.990 --> 02:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
how this body functions how the
 
02:07:05.149 --> 02:07:05.159 align:start position:0%
legislature functions so that's why I
 
02:07:09.669 --> 02:07:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:13.149 --> 02:07:13.159 align:start position:0%
attention Okay I want to get into uh
 
02:07:15.310 --> 02:07:15.320 align:start position:0%
quotes from the court to deal with the
 
02:07:16.830 --> 02:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
subject matter and the first one is the
 
02:07:19.350 --> 02:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment case where reaffirming
 
02:07:20.470 --> 02:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
what I just said to you about the
 
02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
standard of review applying to all the
 
02:07:24.790 --> 02:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
cases we are this is Justice John
 
02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
Roberts I believe we re reiterate that
 
02:07:29.470 --> 02:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
the standard for applying the Second
 
02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment is as follows when the second
 
02:07:33.149 --> 02:07:33.159 align:start position:0%
amendment's plain text covers an
 
02:07:35.589 --> 02:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
individual's conduct the Constitution
 
02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
presumptively protects that conduct the
 
02:07:40.030 --> 02:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
government must then justify its
 
02:07:41.950 --> 02:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
regulation by demonstrating that it's
 
02:07:43.790 --> 02:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
consistent with the nation's historical
 
02:07:46.669 --> 02:07:46.679 align:start position:0%
tradition of firearms regulation only
 
02:07:48.189 --> 02:07:48.199 align:start position:0%
then may the court conclude that the
 
02:07:50.189 --> 02:07:50.199 align:start position:0%
indiv idual conduct Falls outside of the
 
02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment its unqualified command
 
02:07:55.549 --> 02:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
and again this was reiterated in bruan
 
02:07:57.950 --> 02:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
citing heler the Second Amendment
 
02:07:59.390 --> 02:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
standard also and this is where it
 
02:08:01.830 --> 02:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
applies to all of your rights the second
 
02:08:03.870 --> 02:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
amendment applies excuse me the Second
 
02:08:06.270 --> 02:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment standard Accords with how we
 
02:08:09.069 --> 02:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
protect other constitutional rights take
 
02:08:10.629 --> 02:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
for instance the freedom of speech in
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment to which heler
 
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
repeatedly comp compared to the right to
 
02:08:18.109 --> 02:08:18.119 align:start position:0%
keep and be arms in that context quote
 
02:08:20.350 --> 02:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
when the government restricts speech the
 
02:08:22.510 --> 02:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
government Bears the burden of approving
 
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
the constitutionality of its actions and
 
02:08:26.830 --> 02:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
again this committee having oversight
 
02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
over how this legislature functions I
 
02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
felt this was pertinent for you to
 
02:08:33.270 --> 02:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
understand more V Harper on the other
 
02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
hand is the redistricting fight that
 
02:08:37.790 --> 02:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
came down late uh six months ago
 
02:08:40.669 --> 02:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
approximately morvi Harper explores the
 
02:08:42.109 --> 02:08:42.119 align:start position:0%
meaning of the election Clause the
 
02:08:43.629 --> 02:08:43.639 align:start position:0%
federal election Clause Article 1
 
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
Section 4 Clause one of the Federal
 
02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
Constitution requires the legislature of
 
02:08:51.030 --> 02:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
each state to prescribe the rules
 
02:08:53.470 --> 02:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
governing Federal elections the election
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
Clause of the Federal Constitution
 
02:08:57.790 --> 02:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
Article One Clause excuse me Article 1
 
02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
Section 4 Clause 1 is a fundamental
 
02:09:02.069 --> 02:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
right of the people and is expressly
 
02:09:03.430 --> 02:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
requires of the New Hampshire
 
02:09:06.390 --> 02:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
legislature that it shall prescribe the
 
02:09:09.229 --> 02:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
times places and Manner and manner is
 
02:09:11.709 --> 02:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
key that is the process and that's what
 
02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
this is now affecting it's now going to
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
affect how the legislature must deal
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
with with
 
02:09:19.470 --> 02:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
legislation with the restrictions that
 
02:09:23.390 --> 02:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
are now part of this court so let me
 
02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
continue because of this the this power
 
02:09:29.709 --> 02:09:29.719 align:start position:0%
is specific and it's mandatory it cannot
 
02:09:31.709 --> 02:09:31.719 align:start position:0%
be delegated the legislature cannot
 
02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
delegate its authority to make law for
 
02:09:35.790 --> 02:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
example to the ballot law commission
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
this is a big problem the New Hampshire
 
02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in its recent decision in
 
02:09:42.750 --> 02:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
Brown versus Secretary of State in New
 
02:09:45.030 --> 02:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire redistricting case cites the
 
02:09:47.149 --> 02:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
North Carolina redistricting case morvi
 
02:09:50.069 --> 02:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
Harper and and in that in that decision
 
02:09:53.430 --> 02:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
Justice uh Donovan recently wrote citing
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
Mor V Harper explaining in Congressional
 
02:09:58.069 --> 02:09:58.079 align:start position:0%
redistricting case the Supreme Court has
 
02:10:00.030 --> 02:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
an obligation to ensure State Court
 
02:10:02.270 --> 02:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
interpretations of state law do not
 
02:10:04.510 --> 02:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
evade federal law and again that was
 
02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
just recently cited by the state supreme
 
02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
court making Mor V Harper now State
 
02:10:11.589 --> 02:10:11.599 align:start position:0%
president in my opinion the argument
 
02:10:13.229 --> 02:10:13.239 align:start position:0%
Advanced excuse
 
02:10:16.030 --> 02:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
me moving on to the Court's opinion on
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
this subject nothing in the election
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
clause instructs nor has this court ever
 
02:10:22.229 --> 02:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
held that the state legislature May
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
prescribe regulations on the time plac
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
in manner holding Federal elections in
 
02:10:29.669 --> 02:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
defiance of provisions of the State
 
02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution that's critical they're
 
02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
making the point that the state
 
02:10:35.549 --> 02:10:35.559 align:start position:0%
legislature is bound by its written
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
document and he goes on to say quote the
 
02:10:40.189 --> 02:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
argument Advanced by the defendants in
 
02:10:42.669 --> 02:10:42.679 align:start position:0%
this case and The Descent also does not
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
account for the framer's understanding
 
02:10:46.629 --> 02:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
that when the legislature makes laws
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
they are bound by the provisions of the
 
02:10:50.310 --> 02:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
the very document that give them life
 
02:10:52.549 --> 02:10:52.559 align:start position:0%
legislatures as the framers recognized
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
quote are mere creatures of the state
 
02:10:57.030 --> 02:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
constitutions and they cannot be greater
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
than their creators what are legislator
 
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
creatures of the Constitution they owe
 
02:11:03.750 --> 02:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
their existence to the Constitution and
 
02:11:05.629 --> 02:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
they derive their powers from the
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
Constitution it is their commission and
 
02:11:10.549 --> 02:11:10.559 align:start position:0%
therefore all acts must be conformable
 
02:11:13.310 --> 02:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
to it or else they'll be void Marberry
 
02:11:15.390 --> 02:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
confirmed this understanding and nothing
 
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
in the text of the election Clause
 
02:11:19.149 --> 02:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
undermines it when a State Legislature
 
02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
carries out its constitutional power to
 
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
prescribe rules regulating Federal
 
02:11:25.229 --> 02:11:25.239 align:start position:0%
elections the commission under which it
 
02:11:27.950 --> 02:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
exercises Authority is twofold citing
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
Federalist number
 
02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
78 the legislature acts as both a
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
lawmaking body created and bound by its
 
02:11:36.589 --> 02:11:36.599 align:start position:0%
state constitution and as an entity
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
assigned particular authority of the
 
02:11:41.310 --> 02:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution both constitutions
 
02:11:43.390 --> 02:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
control and restrain the legislature's
 
02:11:46.709 --> 02:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
exercise of power and finally the last
 
02:11:49.310 --> 02:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
couple of points here the The Descent
 
02:11:51.790 --> 02:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
back to the Supreme Court here Arizona
 
02:11:55.069 --> 02:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
just as a sidebar Arizona in uh a few
 
02:11:57.589 --> 02:11:57.599 align:start position:0%
years back decided to take from the
 
02:11:59.750 --> 02:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
Arizona legislature the ability to
 
02:12:01.709 --> 02:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
redistrict because Arizona's
 
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution just like ours ours in
 
02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
article 26 and article 65 of part two
 
02:12:09.270 --> 02:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
clearly established and that's what the
 
02:12:11.310 --> 02:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
state supreme court just reaffirmed a
 
02:12:13.790 --> 02:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
month ago that because the Constitution
 
02:12:15.709 --> 02:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
prescribes that the state legislature is
 
02:12:17.709 --> 02:12:17.719 align:start position:0%
responsible for redistricting the courts
 
02:12:19.549 --> 02:12:19.559 align:start position:0%
have no business telling the legislature
 
02:12:22.629 --> 02:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
what to do so in that case they also
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
expounded on Arizona Arizona amended its
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution properly and created a
 
02:12:29.310 --> 02:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
redistricting commission it's got
 
02:12:30.750 --> 02:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
problems they were already suing each
 
02:12:32.109 --> 02:12:32.119 align:start position:0%
other the legislature is suing the
 
02:12:33.910 --> 02:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
redistricting commission you already
 
02:12:36.589 --> 02:12:36.599 align:start position:0%
have that as a proposed cacr before this
 
02:12:39.910 --> 02:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
before the body now I think it's cacr 19
 
02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
but making the final points here on this
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
on that issue Arizona State Legislature
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me The Descent reads Smiley in
 
02:12:48.910 --> 02:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
the Arizona State State Legislature In a
 
02:12:50.950 --> 02:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
Different Light Justice Thomas thinks
 
02:12:52.950 --> 02:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
those cases say nothing about whether a
 
02:12:55.790 --> 02:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
state can impose substantive limits on
 
02:12:58.350 --> 02:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
the legislator's ex exercise of power
 
02:13:00.870 --> 02:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
under the election Clause but in Smiley
 
02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
we addressed whether the conditions
 
02:13:04.149 --> 02:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
which attached to the making of state
 
02:13:07.310 --> 02:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
laws apply to the legislator's exercise
 
02:13:09.950 --> 02:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
of Authority Under the election Clause
 
02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
we held they do much that is urged in
 
02:13:14.430 --> 02:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
argument with regard to the meaning of
 
02:13:16.709 --> 02:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
the term legislature we explained is
 
02:13:18.830 --> 02:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
beside the point and we concluded in
 
02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
straightforward terms the legislature
 
02:13:24.229 --> 02:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
must abide restri by the restrictions
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
imposed by the state constitutions and
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
when restrict when exercising the
 
02:13:30.149 --> 02:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
lawmaking power under the election
 
02:13:32.189 --> 02:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
Clause citing the Arizona State
 
02:13:34.229 --> 02:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
Legislature said much the same
 
02:13:36.790 --> 02:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
emphasizing that by this text nothing in
 
02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
the election Clause offers the state
 
02:13:41.310 --> 02:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
legislator's cart blanch to act in
 
02:13:42.870 --> 02:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
defiance of the State
 
02:13:45.470 --> 02:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution and I'll move to the state
 
02:13:47.470 --> 02:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
constitution part two Article 5 the very
 
02:13:50.109 --> 02:13:50.119 align:start position:0%
instrument that gives you your Authority
 
02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
very old case still stands today Merill
 
02:13:55.310 --> 02:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
versus Sherburn 1818 which said the
 
02:13:57.549 --> 02:13:57.559 align:start position:0%
following that clause which is referring
 
02:14:00.189 --> 02:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
to part two Article 5 which confers upon
 
02:14:01.950 --> 02:14:01.960 align:start position:0%
the general court the authority to make
 
02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
laws provides at the same time they must
 
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
not be repugnant or contrary to the
 
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution so my closing points are we
 
02:14:14.069 --> 02:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
have a big problem now the ballot law
 
02:14:15.910 --> 02:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
commission no under these precedents the
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
ballot law commission no longer has
 
02:14:20.069 --> 02:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
Authority to authorize the towns to use
 
02:14:22.430 --> 02:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
voting machines which is now illegal not
 
02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
because I say so it's because the New
 
02:14:26.189 --> 02:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court has just
 
02:14:28.589 --> 02:14:28.599 align:start position:0%
Incorporated Mor V Harper where this is
 
02:14:31.069 --> 02:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
argued before the federal Supreme Court
 
02:14:34.030 --> 02:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
and finally I'm the one bringing the the
 
02:14:36.709 --> 02:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
action before the court now over many of
 
02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
these illegal changes to our election
 
02:14:40.589 --> 02:14:40.599 align:start position:0%
laws that I believe are unconstitutional
 
02:14:43.549 --> 02:14:43.559 align:start position:0%
but let me quote Justice McDonald who
 
02:14:46.030 --> 02:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
when if you if you want to balance where
 
02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
you think this case is at please go see
 
02:14:49.390 --> 02:14:49.400 align:start position:0%
the oral arguments you're going to see
 
02:14:50.910 --> 02:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
that the state did not do a very good
 
02:14:53.470 --> 02:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
job defending itself and Gordon McDonald
 
02:14:55.229 --> 02:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
chief justice McDonald said a brilliant
 
02:14:57.510 --> 02:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
question he POS this question this is
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
what I want you to remember quote
 
02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
permissible legislative judgment this is
 
02:15:04.270 --> 02:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
he's asking the state's attorney this
 
02:15:06.870 --> 02:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
permissible legislative judgment I don't
 
02:15:08.830 --> 02:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
understand what that term means how is
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
it permissible legislative judgment
 
02:15:12.910 --> 02:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
permissible if it exceeds the authority
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:15:15.870 --> 02:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution brilliant they were
 
02:15:19.310 --> 02:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
prepared thank you questions
 
02:15:23.950 --> 02:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:26.750 --> 02:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:15:29.030 --> 02:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
mcarter thank you Mr Richards for coming
 
02:15:32.910 --> 02:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
today and speaking um on this house
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
resolution there's uh a state that's a
 
02:15:38.229 --> 02:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
neighboring state of ours Massachusetts
 
02:15:41.350 --> 02:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
has a very similar Constitution is in in
 
02:15:43.350 --> 02:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
your experience I understand that you're
 
02:15:44.910 --> 02:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
you're a very studied man with regards
 
02:15:46.910 --> 02:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire Constitution are
 
02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
you aware of of um the similarities to
 
02:15:53.709 --> 02:15:53.719 align:start position:0%
our constitution as Massachusetts has
 
02:15:56.470 --> 02:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
and how they have voting machines in
 
02:15:58.549 --> 02:15:58.559 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts could you could you speak
 
02:16:00.430 --> 02:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
to that or or not yeah absolutely um
 
02:16:02.189 --> 02:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
really straightforward John Adams wrote
 
02:16:04.270 --> 02:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
The Seven the Massachusetts constitution
 
02:16:07.229 --> 02:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
in 1780 New Hampshire was actually the
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
first of all 13 colonies to write a
 
02:16:11.350 --> 02:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
constitution but it was very defective
 
02:16:13.350 --> 02:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
there was one chamber so we go through
 
02:16:15.149 --> 02:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
the Revolutionary War on the other side
 
02:16:16.830 --> 02:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire had the great Fortune to
 
02:16:19.069 --> 02:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
look at the other 12 that had gone into
 
02:16:21.709 --> 02:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
effect During the Revolution and wrote
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
our constitution predicated on theirs
 
02:16:25.950 --> 02:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
the courts always look with great
 
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
interest over opinions or changes to the
 
02:16:31.350 --> 02:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
function of a sister States next door
 
02:16:34.830 --> 02:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
especially because of that genealogy and
 
02:16:37.230 --> 02:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
uh in this case Massachusetts had the
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
same provision about part two article 32
 
02:16:42.589 --> 02:16:42.599 align:start position:0%
that requires three human beings to to
 
02:16:44.509 --> 02:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
conduct the election process the
 
02:16:46.309 --> 02:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
moderator is supposed to sort and count
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
the vote he's supposed to to examine the
 
02:16:51.389 --> 02:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
ballots and declare the count how can he
 
02:16:53.669 --> 02:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
declare the count if he actually didn't
 
02:16:56.349 --> 02:16:56.359 align:start position:0%
count the ballots the clerk the clerk
 
02:16:58.709 --> 02:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
has a duty to not conduct his own
 
02:17:01.070 --> 02:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
certification or his own count but
 
02:17:03.629 --> 02:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
rather to witness the process and then
 
02:17:05.469 --> 02:17:05.479 align:start position:0%
certify that he witnessed the moderator
 
02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
sort and count vote and remember there
 
02:17:09.790 --> 02:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
was no electricity in
 
02:17:12.230 --> 02:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
1784 the courts are very clear on this
 
02:17:13.469 --> 02:17:13.479 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get a court anywhere
 
02:17:15.549 --> 02:17:15.559 align:start position:0%
in the 50 states to say anything other
 
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
than when we look at an any anything to
 
02:17:19.389 --> 02:17:19.399 align:start position:0%
do with our state or federal
 
02:17:21.910 --> 02:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
constitutions we look at original intent
 
02:17:23.790 --> 02:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
what did they mean and so back to the
 
02:17:26.070 --> 02:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
answer Massachusetts put it on the
 
02:17:28.549 --> 02:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
ballot they put it on a referendum and
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
that's what I advocate here you know the
 
02:17:32.589 --> 02:17:32.599 align:start position:0%
Beauty and the genius of our form of
 
02:17:35.070 --> 02:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
government is the ability to alter it
 
02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
and I got to tell you I'm a I'm an
 
02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
independent I vote Republican but I'll
 
02:17:40.870 --> 02:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
tell you this the Democrats are smart
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
about some things okay and one of them
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
is they hire good lawyers and what are
 
02:17:46.389 --> 02:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
they all doing about the lack of
 
02:17:48.070 --> 02:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
progress they're making over is issues
 
02:17:49.950 --> 02:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
the redistricting fight what did they do
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
there they lost twice it was it was
 
02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
vetoed so now they're putting a cacr
 
02:17:56.910 --> 02:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
abortion is another great issue right
 
02:17:59.389 --> 02:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
why did why did it get struck down it's
 
02:18:01.790 --> 02:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't a constitutional right
 
02:18:03.270 --> 02:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
so now what are they doing they're
 
02:18:05.669 --> 02:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
preparing a constitutional amendment and
 
02:18:08.830 --> 02:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
so to all the Grievances uh that I that
 
02:18:11.429 --> 02:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
I am against in my in my brief in my
 
02:18:14.190 --> 02:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
lawsuit is all the same problem it's all
 
02:18:16.270 --> 02:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
failure to follow the process because
 
02:18:19.549 --> 02:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
hope that answered your question thank
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
you it's just based on what you just
 
02:18:27.469 --> 02:18:27.479 align:start position:0%
said it just help me out here that the
 
02:18:29.950 --> 02:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
moderator is required to count the
 
02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
ballots sort and count sort specifically
 
02:18:34.270 --> 02:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
is what's not happening the the
 
02:18:36.110 --> 02:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
moderator that's a singular person
 
02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:37.389 align:start position:0%
moderator that's a singular person
that's

02:18:37.389 --> 02:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:18:40.589 --> 02:18:40.599 align:start position:0%
right okay all right I'll just go back
 
02:18:43.469 --> 02:18:43.479 align:start position:0%
to my 18,000 935 people being counted
 
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
byat let me give you a really good
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
solution I'd like to answer question if
 
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's okay um here's the Simplicity of
 
02:18:52.990 --> 02:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
it the constitution of New Hampshire was
 
02:18:55.309 --> 02:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
written in 1784 where the population
 
02:18:57.469 --> 02:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
which much smaller and so it's been
 
02:19:00.030 --> 02:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
amended a bunch of times along the way
 
02:19:02.429 --> 02:19:02.439 align:start position:0%
and the on the the proper process at
 
02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
each step so the solution to your
 
02:19:06.349 --> 02:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
problem is we need to have some type of
 
02:19:08.589 --> 02:19:08.599 align:start position:0%
amendment to address the issue like one
 
02:19:10.469 --> 02:19:10.479 align:start position:0%
of the other gentlemen pointed out if
 
02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature needs to pass
 
02:19:14.230 --> 02:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
legislation to reinforce the local
 
02:19:16.709 --> 02:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities to deal with this look
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
this legisl is going to have to deal
 
02:19:19.669 --> 02:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
with this problem if it rules and
 
02:19:22.309 --> 02:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
Strikes these things down real soon like
 
02:19:24.389 --> 02:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
sooner than later maybe before the the
 
02:19:26.309 --> 02:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
upcoming election and if they don't have
 
02:19:28.030 --> 02:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
machines in place and the court strikes
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
that down they need to put a game plan
 
02:19:32.349 --> 02:19:32.359 align:start position:0%
together and better to know now than to
 
02:19:34.110 --> 02:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
find out during the election process but

open

02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:42.880 align:start position:0%

District 19 uh which is Rochester Wards
 
02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
1 2 3 four and six um I'm here to speak
 
02:22:59.469 --> 02:22:59.479 align:start position:0%
in fully support of house resolution 25
 
02:23:02.070 --> 02:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
I support this bill because I know that
 
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
there is really only one lawful way for
 
02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
any constitutional provision to be
 
02:23:09.309 --> 02:23:09.319 align:start position:0%
altered and that is by asking the people
 
02:23:12.270 --> 02:23:12.280 align:start position:0%
in a banial election year if a majority
 
02:23:14.910 --> 02:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
of them agree to amend the Constitution
 
02:23:16.830 --> 02:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
it's pretty simple other than that the
 
02:23:20.349 --> 02:23:20.359 align:start position:0%
leg ISL does not have any authority to
 
02:23:22.030 --> 02:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
amend or alter a constitutional
 
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
provision I have searched repeatedly and
 
02:23:28.309 --> 02:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
I cannot find any record of the people
 
02:23:31.269 --> 02:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire voting to amend New
 
02:23:32.950 --> 02:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution part one article
 
02:23:37.550 --> 02:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
11 nor part two article 32 despite this
 
02:23:39.590 --> 02:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
lack of evidence showing that that the
 
02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
people who are the only ones with the
 
02:23:43.790 --> 02:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
authority to amend a constitutional
 
02:23:46.590 --> 02:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
provision I do in fact see that New
 
02:23:49.110 --> 02:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire part one article 11 and New
 
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and New Hampshire part 2
 
02:23:54.750 --> 02:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
article 32 have been altered by
 
02:23:57.309 --> 02:23:57.319 align:start position:0%
legislative um by the legislature via
 
02:24:00.910 --> 02:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
statute these unlawful acts must be
 
02:24:03.230 --> 02:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
reversed I'm going to digress just real
 
02:24:04.590 --> 02:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
quick because of all this testimony
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's happened I don't understand how
 
02:24:10.870 --> 02:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
how do we pass a bill because this is a
 
02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
real resolution right so we're out of
 
02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
compliance so if we're out of compliance
 
02:24:19.469 --> 02:24:19.479 align:start position:0%
why would we're breaking the law so how
 
02:24:20.950 --> 02:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
are we going to pass a bill to say don't
 
02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
break the law so then may we should just
 
02:24:25.389 --> 02:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
pass a bill that says that so that to me
 
02:24:28.230 --> 02:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's just like a a circular firing squad
 
02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
but I I digress um so we must now
 
02:24:35.990 --> 02:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
resolve as a body who are bound by oath
 
02:24:37.990 --> 02:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
to uphold New Hampshire part one article
 
02:24:40.469 --> 02:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
11 and New Hampshire part two article 32
 
02:24:43.150 --> 02:24:43.160 align:start position:0%
to fulfill our fiduciary duty to uphold
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional Provisions as they
 
02:24:49.030 --> 02:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
appear expressively written now in our
 
02:24:51.429 --> 02:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
state constitution which is a trust and
 
02:24:53.550 --> 02:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
denture contract which is mentioned of
 
02:24:56.429 --> 02:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
course in this resolution voters are the
 
02:24:59.469 --> 02:24:59.479 align:start position:0%
granters I as an elected official I'm
 
02:25:01.830 --> 02:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
the grantee in a sense the voters are
 
02:25:04.269 --> 02:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
their trustees I is an elected official
 
02:25:07.349 --> 02:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
and responsibility for protecting the
 
02:25:10.469 --> 02:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
trust the contract in essence the
 
02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
representatives are the employees to the
 
02:25:15.389 --> 02:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
citizens of New
 
02:25:17.590 --> 02:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire unless any one on this
 
02:25:19.670 --> 02:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
committee or anywhere else in this you
 
02:25:22.590 --> 02:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
know legislative body possesses evidence
 
02:25:24.950 --> 02:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
that there was in fact a vote by the
 
02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
people to amend the Constitutional
 
02:25:28.830 --> 02:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
Provisions as seen in New Hampshire part
 
02:25:31.150 --> 02:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
1 article 11 in New Hampshire part two
 
02:25:33.910 --> 02:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
article 32 then I need to see that
 
02:25:36.190 --> 02:25:36.200 align:start position:0%
evidence and it needs to be placed into
 
02:25:38.510 --> 02:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
the express writings of those Provisions
 
02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
because as it stands today the express
 
02:25:43.230 --> 02:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
written Provisions do not make allowance
 
02:25:45.950 --> 02:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
for any machines and machines have been
 
02:25:47.429 --> 02:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
talked about a lot
 
02:25:50.790 --> 02:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
and um I'd really like to focus on the
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot piece because that is
 
02:25:55.510 --> 02:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
the huge one that is that has changed
 
02:25:58.630 --> 02:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
since 2020 moving forward by percentage
 
02:26:01.150 --> 02:26:01.160 align:start position:0%
increases in a town at at the time I was
 
02:26:04.870 --> 02:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
living in Rye uh the absentee ballot
 
02:26:08.110 --> 02:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
rate was less than 10% it went up to
 
02:26:12.990 --> 02:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
over 30% we had over 100% voter turnout
 
02:26:15.070 --> 02:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
that can't be when it's never been more
 
02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
than 65% these are things that to me the
 
02:26:22.190 --> 02:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot process which for in the
 
02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution the only two ways that you
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
can vote if you are absent from the city
 
02:26:30.990 --> 02:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
or town of which you are inhabitant or
 
02:26:33.269 --> 02:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
by reason of physical disability and are
 
02:26:34.950 --> 02:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
enable to vote in
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
person that to me is is uh is so crucial
 
02:26:40.830 --> 02:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if that's really been
 
02:26:44.670 --> 02:26:44.680 align:start position:0%
talked about a lot today so
 
02:26:46.990 --> 02:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
um where am I at so for these these
 
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
reasons uh hr25 in necessity in order
 
02:26:52.110 --> 02:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to provide a path to
 
02:26:54.830 --> 02:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
come back into compliance uh with
 
02:26:56.790 --> 02:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional Provisions controlling
 
02:26:58.389 --> 02:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
the parameters of elections in New
 
02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I I hope that uh you take
 
02:27:03.750 --> 02:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm glad that you gave us all this
 
02:27:06.030 --> 02:27:06.040 align:start position:0%

and asking for five minutes and is
 
02:27:33.269 --> 02:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
opposed to the
 
02:27:41.790 --> 02:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:45.349 --> 02:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
Gould sorry that's better uh thank you
 
02:27:47.990 --> 02:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
02:27:50.349 --> 02:27:50.359 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Brian Gould I'm a lawyer
 
02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
here in conquer I practice with
 
02:27:54.630 --> 02:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
Cleveland Waters and bass two streets
 
02:27:57.190 --> 02:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
over um I practiced law in New Hampshire
 
02:28:01.950 --> 02:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
about 35 years um over the course of my
 
02:28:04.830 --> 02:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
career I've regularly litigated
 
02:28:07.990 --> 02:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional U matters um which is
 
02:28:09.950 --> 02:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
unusual because I'm a civil litigator
 
02:28:12.510 --> 02:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
not a con criminal litigator they deal
 
02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
with constitutional issues frequently
 
02:28:16.990 --> 02:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
but in the Civil context not quite as
 
02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
much um to give you a couple of quick
 
02:28:22.309 --> 02:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
examples I was uh the lawyer for the
 
02:28:24.910 --> 02:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
governor and executive counsel uh when
 
02:28:27.670 --> 02:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature attempted to modify the
 
02:28:30.830 --> 02:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
statute that would dictate who the Chief
 
02:28:33.710 --> 02:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
Justice of the Supreme Court would be
 
02:28:36.269 --> 02:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
and we prevailed on an original petition
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
before the uh before replacement
 
02:28:40.990 --> 02:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
justices on the New Hampshire supreme
 
02:28:43.030 --> 02:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
court because they were all recused
 
02:28:45.550 --> 02:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
because it affected all of them um but
 
02:28:47.790 --> 02:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
we prevailed in that case and uh the
 
02:28:51.630 --> 02:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
court the reconstituted Court held that
 
02:28:53.790 --> 02:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
uh there that the legislature had
 
02:28:56.349 --> 02:28:56.359 align:start position:0%
violated the separation of powers and
 
02:28:59.389 --> 02:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
had violated the Constitution uh by
 
02:29:01.389 --> 02:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
attempting to intervene in how the Chief
 
02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
Justice was selected another case in
 
02:29:07.070 --> 02:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
which I worked was at more recently was
 
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate Bill 3
 
02:29:11.110 --> 02:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
litigation uh I know the chairman is
 
02:29:13.710 --> 02:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
very familiar with that um because I
 
02:29:15.309 --> 02:29:15.319 align:start position:0%
believe he delivered the committee
 
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
report on the floor
 
02:29:19.030 --> 02:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh for the election law committee uh
 
02:29:21.790 --> 02:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
supporting that bill I was retained by
 
02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire to supplement
 
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
the uh represent the defense of that
 
02:29:30.070 --> 02:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
bill by the Attorney General's office I
 
02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
represented the attorney general who at
 
02:29:33.670 --> 02:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
that time was Gordon McDonald and the
 
02:29:35.710 --> 02:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State who at that time was
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
Bill Gardner in that case and we tried
 
02:29:40.950 --> 02:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
that case and eventually it was taken up
 
02:29:43.550 --> 02:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire Supreme Court and
 
02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
the bill was struck down the reason I
 
02:29:50.070 --> 02:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
mention this is because um over the
 
02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
years I've developed um a fair amount of
 
02:29:56.790 --> 02:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
experience with election law um I'm not
 
02:29:59.670 --> 02:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
at the level that say Bud Fitch is um
 
02:30:02.710 --> 02:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
you know bud is is sort of encyclopedic
 
02:30:04.950 --> 02:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh on those things over at the U
 
02:30:07.429 --> 02:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
secretary's office but I have had a fair
 
02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
amount of u of dealing with these
 
02:30:14.950 --> 02:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
cases those of us uh and and I count
 
02:30:17.830 --> 02:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
myself among them who favor increasing
 
02:30:20.670 --> 02:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of our elections have to
 
02:30:23.349 --> 02:30:23.359 align:start position:0%
face some facts though um because these
 
02:30:25.550 --> 02:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
issues end up getting resolved in the
 
02:30:27.750 --> 02:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
courts and so it's not a matter of
 
02:30:30.510 --> 02:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
theory it's a matter of experience what
 
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
have we learned from the courts in New
 
02:30:34.670 --> 02:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire over the
 
02:30:38.190 --> 02:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
years um one thing that we can that we
 
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
can say with with some certainty is that
 
02:30:44.590 --> 02:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
the courts uh look very skeptically on
 
02:30:48.230 --> 02:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
changes in law that restrict ballot
 
02:30:50.510 --> 02:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
access from what it is
 
02:30:53.309 --> 02:30:53.319 align:start position:0%
currently so you start at a disadvantage
 
02:30:54.990 --> 02:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
to the extent that you're trying to cut
 
02:30:58.389 --> 02:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
back on uh ballot
 
02:31:00.870 --> 02:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
access and that
 
02:31:03.870 --> 02:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
is sort of an overarching principle here
 
02:31:05.830 --> 02:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
is if you think about it there's tension
 
02:31:10.190 --> 02:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
between the desire to uh to ensure that
 
02:31:13.790 --> 02:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
only qualified voters can pull a
 
02:31:19.790 --> 02:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
ballot and the the uh the burden that's
 
02:31:22.870 --> 02:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
placed on voters uh their right to vote
 
02:31:24.590 --> 02:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
because if you are going to restrict
 
02:31:26.030 --> 02:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
access you're going to say I'm going to
 
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
impose these these
 
02:31:30.590 --> 02:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
qualifications you
 
02:31:35.030 --> 02:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
are uh necessarily excluding some voters
 
02:31:37.990 --> 02:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
as unqualified and the question becomes
 
02:31:42.550 --> 02:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
is that necessary to protect against um
 
02:31:45.070 --> 02:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
unqualified voters voter and that's the
 
02:31:48.590 --> 02:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
balancing that the courts
 
02:31:48.600 --> 02:31:50.150 align:start position:0%
balancing that the courts
undertake

02:31:50.150 --> 02:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
undertake
 
02:31:53.469 --> 02:31:53.479 align:start position:0%
um another observation is and and this
 
02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
is why I decided to come today because
 
02:31:58.389 --> 02:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
it's not so much the underlying policy
 
02:32:00.550 --> 02:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
that's being promoted by this but the
 
02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle by which um this is being
 
02:32:06.469 --> 02:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
proposed because aside from the language
 
02:32:09.630 --> 02:32:09.640 align:start position:0%
of any Amendment to the
 
02:32:12.510 --> 02:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
rsas probably in an election law case
 
02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
probably the most important
 
02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
factor uh is whether the new restriction
 
02:32:21.469 --> 02:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
uh the most important factor in
 
02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
determining whether the new restriction
 
02:32:25.030 --> 02:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
survives judicial scrutiny is
 
02:32:25.040 --> 02:32:27.230 align:start position:0%
survives judicial scrutiny is
legislative

02:32:27.230 --> 02:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
02:32:31.510 --> 02:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
history um if any inflammatory or
 
02:32:34.110 --> 02:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
eccentric language in legislative
 
02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
statements not that that would ever
 
02:32:39.070 --> 02:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
happen but um whether it's in the bill
 
02:32:42.389 --> 02:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
in committee on the floor make the
 
02:32:44.510 --> 02:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
defense of the new language very
 
02:32:46.389 --> 02:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
difficult as an example in the Senate
 
02:32:51.630 --> 02:32:51.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 3 case um the plaintiffs uh who
 
02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
were the Democratic party and um a
 
02:32:58.750 --> 02:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
national uh super pack had uh become
 
02:33:01.429 --> 02:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
involved and and recruited some
 
02:33:05.309 --> 02:33:05.319 align:start position:0%
Plains but they focused on the fact that
 
02:33:07.990 --> 02:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
some people even just lobbyists had
 
02:33:10.429 --> 02:33:10.439 align:start position:0%
testified that the reason for this bill
 
02:33:12.469 --> 02:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
was to prevent college students from
 
02:33:15.269 --> 02:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
voting in New Hampshire elections and
 
02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
the bill did nothing about the kind but
 
02:33:19.910 --> 02:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
because that was in the legislative
 
02:33:21.790 --> 02:33:21.800 align:start position:0%
history and showed a certain hostility
 
02:33:25.870 --> 02:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
to a certain class of voter uh the court
 
02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
the the Superior Court seized on that as
 
02:33:32.469 --> 02:33:32.479 align:start position:0%
evidence that this uh bill
 
02:33:35.790 --> 02:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
was intended to restrict votes without
 
02:33:37.750 --> 02:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
an an appropriate
 
02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:40.950 align:start position:0%
an an appropriate
basis

02:33:40.950 --> 02:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:44.510 --> 02:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
and I know that house resolution 25
 
02:33:46.429 --> 02:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually amend anything of it
 
02:33:47.870 --> 02:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like there's some debate about
 
02:33:50.750 --> 02:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
that but if it were to pass and
 
02:33:53.110 --> 02:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
legislation were enacted actually
 
02:33:55.950 --> 02:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
enacted that is consistent with the
 
02:33:58.670 --> 02:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
objectives of uh house resolution
 
02:34:01.990 --> 02:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
25 the resolution itself will be part of
 
02:34:04.110 --> 02:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
that legislative record if if the bill
 
02:34:07.630 --> 02:34:07.640 align:start position:0%
is challenged on uh in the courts and I
 
02:34:10.309 --> 02:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
I believe that several parts of this
 
02:34:12.590 --> 02:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
resolution will make future consistent
 
02:34:15.070 --> 02:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
amendments to the statutes that is
 
02:34:19.349 --> 02:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
regarding ballots and U voting machines
 
02:34:21.190 --> 02:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh more far more difficult for the
 
02:34:23.590 --> 02:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office to
 
02:34:26.190 --> 02:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
defend um for example you heard a
 
02:34:28.990 --> 02:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
reference to the Constitution as being a
 
02:34:31.389 --> 02:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
trust instrument there is one reference
 
02:34:33.710 --> 02:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
to trust in part two I think it's
 
02:34:37.070 --> 02:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
article 84 of the of the Constitution
 
02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
but the Constitution does it doesn't
 
02:34:41.710 --> 02:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
itself say that it is a trust instrument
 
02:34:44.590 --> 02:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
so the reasoning that flows from that
 
02:34:48.750 --> 02:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
assertion in this um in this resolution
 
02:34:52.510 --> 02:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
would be viewed I think as um it's
 
02:34:54.670 --> 02:34:54.680 align:start position:0%
interesting intellectually but I think
 
02:34:56.750 --> 02:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
the courts would view it as an eccentric
 
02:34:59.510 --> 02:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
point of view which harms your ability
 
02:35:01.550 --> 02:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
to defend the the
 
02:35:05.070 --> 02:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
legislation um this resolution relies on
 
02:35:08.429 --> 02:35:08.439 align:start position:0%
16th century maxims of law from Lord
 
02:35:12.870 --> 02:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
cook and uh Sir Francis Bacon uh both of
 
02:35:15.150 --> 02:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
whom were controversial in their time
 
02:35:17.349 --> 02:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
this was before the the uh the pilgrims
 
02:35:20.670 --> 02:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
sailed for the new world that they were
 
02:35:23.469 --> 02:35:23.479 align:start position:0%
uh positing these maxims under English
 
02:35:26.110 --> 02:35:26.120 align:start position:0%
law I can honestly say I've never seen
 
02:35:28.110 --> 02:35:28.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court cite one
 
02:35:31.190 --> 02:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
of these maxims they may have at some
 
02:35:33.389 --> 02:35:33.399 align:start position:0%
point but it's not likely to be very
 
02:35:35.630 --> 02:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
persuasive at all and to include
 
02:35:38.750 --> 02:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
something that is that unusual in the
 
02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
legislative findings and recitations
 
02:35:44.230 --> 02:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
makes it very difficult to defend the
 
02:35:46.510 --> 02:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
merits of any uh change in the law that
 
02:35:47.950 --> 02:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
you might uh
 
02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:50.150 align:start position:0%
you might uh
enact

02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
enact
 
02:35:54.309 --> 02:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
um Mr Richard testified about his
 
02:35:58.190 --> 02:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
understanding of the bruan decision um
 
02:36:01.590 --> 02:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
and I understand I understand what he's
 
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
trying to say about that but I think
 
02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:04.870 align:start position:0%
trying to say about that but I think
what

02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:36:07.070 --> 02:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
he's and the reason it's important is
 
02:36:08.790 --> 02:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
it's in the
 
02:36:10.910 --> 02:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
resolution that's a very aggressive
 
02:36:14.910 --> 02:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
reading of bruan that it now eliminates
 
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
the mean means ends testing you may have
 
02:36:21.030 --> 02:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
heard of strict scrutiny intermediate
 
02:36:23.510 --> 02:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
scrutiny rational basis tests these are
 
02:36:26.269 --> 02:36:26.279 align:start position:0%
all tests the courts use to determine
 
02:36:28.230 --> 02:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
whether a burden on a constitutional
 
02:36:32.550 --> 02:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
right is uh lawful um and the court did
 
02:36:35.550 --> 02:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
Express skepticism about that in bruan
 
02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
but that case is limited to the Second
 
02:36:40.389 --> 02:36:40.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment the court has not said that
 
02:36:42.990 --> 02:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
it's dispensing with that altogether so
 
02:36:45.870 --> 02:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
for this legislature to to accept that
 
02:36:48.190 --> 02:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
reading of Bruin before The Supreme
 
02:36:50.110 --> 02:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
Court has said that it applies across
 
02:36:52.269 --> 02:36:52.279 align:start position:0%
the board and before the New Hampshire
 
02:36:54.469 --> 02:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has said anything about
 
02:36:56.349 --> 02:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
whether it will follow Bruin for matters
 
02:36:59.750 --> 02:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
of State constitutional rights Again
 
02:37:02.469 --> 02:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
undermines The legislator's credibility
 
02:37:04.510 --> 02:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
with the courts and it's very important
 
02:37:05.910 --> 02:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
if you're going to undertake these kind
 
02:37:08.830 --> 02:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
of policy changes in the election law
 
02:37:11.830 --> 02:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
context that you have that level of
 
02:37:15.349 --> 02:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
credibility um there are citations to a
 
02:37:17.590 --> 02:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
number of authorities in this resolution
 
02:37:20.590 --> 02:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
none of them uh to an opinion of the New
 
02:37:23.190 --> 02:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court Justices or an
 
02:37:25.830 --> 02:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
opinion of the new yire supreme court
 
02:37:28.750 --> 02:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
itself um and in fact that's important
 
02:37:32.190 --> 02:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
because during the Civil
 
02:37:36.670 --> 02:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
War our court uh the justices took up a
 
02:37:42.550 --> 02:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
a a statutory change to allow the uh The
 
02:37:44.710 --> 02:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
Men Who were fighting for us in the
 
02:37:47.910 --> 02:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
Civil War to vote remotely and our
 
02:37:50.190 --> 02:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
Supreme which all of us I think would be
 
02:37:52.550 --> 02:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
generally sympathetic to Supreme Court
 
02:37:56.469 --> 02:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
said no the sup the the Constitution at
 
02:37:59.309 --> 02:37:59.319 align:start position:0%
that time did not allow for absentee uh
 
02:38:01.510 --> 02:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
balloting of this kind and they didn't
 
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
allow it there was a few years later
 
02:38:06.550 --> 02:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
there was a a fix that did get past the
 
02:38:10.150 --> 02:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
court um but my point is there is New
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Authority but that's not cited
 
02:38:15.429 --> 02:38:15.439 align:start position:0%
in this resolution which is a red flag
 
02:38:18.190 --> 02:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
to court that you know you're not even
 
02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
relying on established New Hampshire law
 
02:38:22.550 --> 02:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
as the basis for this
 
02:38:25.429 --> 02:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
resolution um and then finally there's a
 
02:38:29.030 --> 02:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
reference in here to the uh people
 
02:38:32.190 --> 02:38:32.200 align:start position:0%
having what's called inum jurisdiction
 
02:38:35.389 --> 02:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
over legislators again a very eccentric
 
02:38:38.950 --> 02:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
way of putting the concept that the
 
02:38:42.670 --> 02:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
legislature is generally answerable to
 
02:38:45.830 --> 02:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
the people uh to courts in Persona Juris
 
02:38:48.070 --> 02:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
ition refers to the ability of the court
 
02:38:50.469 --> 02:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
to exercise authority over a party
 
02:38:53.269 --> 02:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
before it so to use that term in this
 
02:38:57.230 --> 02:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
context is jarring and so my point in
 
02:38:58.830 --> 02:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
all of this
 
02:39:02.030 --> 02:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
is I'm I'm not here to talk about you
 
02:39:04.309 --> 02:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
know whether voting machines are a good
 
02:39:06.790 --> 02:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
idea or a bad idea or um you know the
 
02:39:09.190 --> 02:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
scope of absentee balloting although I
 
02:39:11.150 --> 02:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
think the new supreme court and the
 
02:39:13.150 --> 02:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
justices have made pretty clear what the
 
02:39:17.670 --> 02:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:20.790 --> 02:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
but it is it is critical if you're going
 
02:39:23.429 --> 02:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
to go down this path that whatever it is
 
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
that you pass is credible with the
 
02:39:28.510 --> 02:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
courts because that's where it's going
 
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
to end up and so if you care about the
 
02:39:35.630 --> 02:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
outcome any of these references to um
 
02:39:38.389 --> 02:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
obscure areas of law and the sort of
 
02:39:41.070 --> 02:39:41.080 align:start position:0%
theorizing should be very very carefully
 
02:39:43.269 --> 02:39:43.279 align:start position:0%
vetted because you don't want to pass
 
02:39:46.030 --> 02:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
something that the courts read and say I
 
02:39:48.830 --> 02:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
don't even know what this means this
 
02:39:51.309 --> 02:39:51.319 align:start position:0%
none of this language makes sense to me
 
02:39:53.269 --> 02:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
I can't relate to it it's not something
 
02:39:54.790 --> 02:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
on which I would
 
02:39:59.790 --> 02:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
rely so that's that's my testimony um
 
02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for listening thank
 
02:40:03.469 --> 02:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
you for your time appreciate it would
 
02:40:05.550 --> 02:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
you be willing to take a question or two
 
02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:06.389 align:start position:0%
you be willing to take a question or two
oh

02:40:06.389 --> 02:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:40:08.710 --> 02:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
sure are there a question I thought
 
02:40:11.790 --> 02:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
there might um representative
 
02:40:14.910 --> 02:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
mcarter thank you Mr chair to see you
 
02:40:18.190 --> 02:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
again you too thanks for coming today um
 
02:40:22.030 --> 02:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
I just have a quick question and uh I
 
02:40:24.230 --> 02:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
would suspect you have the answer can
 
02:40:28.389 --> 02:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
you point me to where I can find uh in
 
02:40:30.790 --> 02:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
our constitution where we have to wait
 
02:40:33.750 --> 02:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
as legislators or the legislature as a
 
02:40:37.070 --> 02:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
whole where we would have to wait for
 
02:40:40.670 --> 02:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
the courts to point out that we have uh
 
02:40:42.750 --> 02:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
created statute and error or we have
 
02:40:44.670 --> 02:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
made a mistake and we need to fix that
 
02:40:46.110 --> 02:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
mistake can you
 
02:40:48.150 --> 02:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
Define that for me because I'm having a
 
02:40:50.190 --> 02:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
hard time with that if that's if that's
 
02:40:52.269 --> 02:40:52.279 align:start position:0%
the impression I left you with then
 
02:40:55.030 --> 02:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
that's my error I did not mean to imply
 
02:40:57.389 --> 02:40:57.399 align:start position:0%
that you have to wait for the courts
 
02:41:01.269 --> 02:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is that if you modify
 
02:41:03.830 --> 02:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
statutes the predicate on which you
 
02:41:06.429 --> 02:41:06.439 align:start position:0%
modify those statutes will be relevant
 
02:41:09.110 --> 02:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
to a review by the courts of whether
 
02:41:11.550 --> 02:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
that change in law is
 
02:41:15.750 --> 02:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
lawful um the legislature has an in has
 
02:41:18.269 --> 02:41:18.279 align:start position:0%
independent authority to determine
 
02:41:21.630 --> 02:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
whether a statute is unlawful or
 
02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional in the first place it
 
02:41:27.429 --> 02:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
can certainly do that but if the result
 
02:41:30.269 --> 02:41:30.279 align:start position:0%
of that determination is that you're
 
02:41:34.190 --> 02:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
going to restrict access to the
 
02:41:37.710 --> 02:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
ballot that raises a significant issue
 
02:41:40.910 --> 02:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
in the minds of the courts we have a lot
 
02:41:43.349 --> 02:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
of indications most recently probably in
 
02:41:45.670 --> 02:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
the in the Senate Bill 3 decision ision
 
02:41:48.550 --> 02:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
but based on the GU uh
 
02:41:50.990 --> 02:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
decision um that the courts are going to
 
02:41:54.790 --> 02:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
look very carefully at a change in law
 
02:41:57.230 --> 02:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
that makes it harder to to get a ballot
 
02:42:00.030 --> 02:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean it won't uphold it but
 
02:42:02.030 --> 02:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
you have to understand you're going into
 
02:42:05.389 --> 02:42:05.399 align:start position:0%
those cases with the court being very
 
02:42:07.710 --> 02:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
skeptical and that's the that's the
 
02:42:11.309 --> 02:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
battle that I'm trying to um point out
 
02:42:13.309 --> 02:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
to this committee is the one you need to
 
02:42:15.469 --> 02:42:15.479 align:start position:0%
think about winning because you can pass
 
02:42:17.469 --> 02:42:17.479 align:start position:0%
anything but the courts have the
 
02:42:19.550 --> 02:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
authority to declare what you pass
 
02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and to get past that I
 
02:42:23.870 --> 02:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
think you need to build a sort of a
 
02:42:26.030 --> 02:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
better record than I think this
 
02:42:30.230 --> 02:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
resolution does that answers your
 
02:42:32.710 --> 02:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
question um can I just follow on that
 
02:42:34.030 --> 02:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
point a
 
02:42:37.950 --> 02:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
bit is it the fact of being a resolution
 
02:42:42.950 --> 02:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
that the court would question or um does
 
02:42:45.510 --> 02:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
that matter I don't I don't think it
 
02:42:47.670 --> 02:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
matters I mean I'm not going to jump
 
02:42:49.110 --> 02:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
into the debate over whether a
 
02:42:51.710 --> 02:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
resolution is effective I think
 
02:42:53.389 --> 02:42:53.399 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson made the point
 
02:42:55.910 --> 02:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
that um that it is a resolution and
 
02:42:59.150 --> 02:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
therefore is not binding law I think
 
02:43:00.630 --> 02:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
that that's my understanding of a
 
02:43:03.429 --> 02:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
resolution I'm thinking longer term
 
02:43:05.910 --> 02:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
because if the legislature wants to
 
02:43:08.710 --> 02:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
change these policies on voting machines
 
02:43:10.910 --> 02:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
and absentee ballots it's going to have
 
02:43:13.710 --> 02:43:13.720 align:start position:0%
to enact legislation to change the
 
02:43:17.349 --> 02:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
law this resolution containing as it
 
02:43:20.389 --> 02:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
does a certain rationale for that
 
02:43:20.399 --> 02:43:21.510 align:start position:0%
does a certain rationale for that
becomes

02:43:21.510 --> 02:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
02:43:23.910 --> 02:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
evidence when that later bill is
 
02:43:26.710 --> 02:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
challenged because it's part of you know
 
02:43:28.389 --> 02:43:28.399 align:start position:0%
I've heard people say this resolution
 
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
sort of sets the table for
 
02:43:33.150 --> 02:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
legislation if that's true then that
 
02:43:35.870 --> 02:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
means if there's a challenge to it this
 
02:43:37.349 --> 02:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
resolution becomes part of the
 
02:43:38.990 --> 02:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
legislative record and if there's
 
02:43:41.349 --> 02:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
something in the legislative record that
 
02:43:44.790 --> 02:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
makes the courts look a scance at what
 
02:43:48.030 --> 02:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
the legis was thinking that makes it
 
02:43:49.830 --> 02:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
much more difficult to defend the
 
02:43:52.510 --> 02:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
lawfulness of that later legislation so
 
02:43:55.670 --> 02:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
that the short answer is no the fact
 
02:43:57.309 --> 02:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
that it's a resolution doesn't matter
 
02:43:58.190 --> 02:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
02:44:01.469 --> 02:44:01.479 align:start position:0%
content thank you representative
 
02:44:03.870 --> 02:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
sers thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:44:06.910 --> 02:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm trying to
 
02:44:09.510 --> 02:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
understand something you're saying there
 
02:44:12.429 --> 02:44:12.439 align:start position:0%
that how does this
 
02:44:15.389 --> 02:44:15.399 align:start position:0%
resolution exclude voters or restrict
 
02:44:19.389 --> 02:44:19.399 align:start position:0%
the ballot access if it's requiring the
 
02:44:22.750 --> 02:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
government to follow the
 
02:44:26.269 --> 02:44:26.279 align:start position:0%
Constitution and I I understand and I'm
 
02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
very sympathetic personally to that what
 
02:44:30.710 --> 02:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get across is
 
02:44:36.389 --> 02:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
this the challenge to laws that restrict
 
02:44:40.469 --> 02:44:40.479 align:start position:0%
access to the ballot are are evaluated
 
02:44:43.389 --> 02:44:43.399 align:start position:0%
against what is the current state of the
 
02:44:47.150 --> 02:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
law so even if you've gone if you've
 
02:44:47.160 --> 02:44:48.110 align:start position:0%
law so even if you've gone if you've
gone

02:44:48.110 --> 02:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
gone
 
02:44:51.950 --> 02:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
beyond uh what the Constitution requires
 
02:44:53.510 --> 02:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
and so you're passing a law that you
 
02:44:56.429 --> 02:44:56.439 align:start position:0%
think brings it back within uh
 
02:44:56.439 --> 02:44:58.190 align:start position:0%
think brings it back within uh
constitutional

02:44:58.190 --> 02:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
02:45:00.670 --> 02:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
boundaries you're still restricting
 
02:45:03.550 --> 02:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
access to the ballot from what it
 
02:45:06.910 --> 02:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
was right that's the whole point and
 
02:45:09.830 --> 02:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to say is when the
 
02:45:13.269 --> 02:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
legislature tries to restrict
 
02:45:16.110 --> 02:45:16.120 align:start position:0%
access the courts look skeptically at
 
02:45:17.670 --> 02:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't mean that the court
 
02:45:20.030 --> 02:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
won't uphold it but the court looks
 
02:45:23.469 --> 02:45:23.479 align:start position:0%
skeptically at the legislature trying to
 
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
restrict access because remember I
 
02:45:27.990 --> 02:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
talked about there's a balance between
 
02:45:30.710 --> 02:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
the right to vote and this
 
02:45:32.910 --> 02:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
legislature's absolutely legitimate
 
02:45:36.269 --> 02:45:36.279 align:start position:0%
interest which I defended at length and
 
02:45:37.750 --> 02:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
almost get to the point where I was out
 
02:45:40.309 --> 02:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
of breath in the Senate Bill 3 case I'm
 
02:45:43.389 --> 02:45:43.399 align:start position:0%
very sympathetic to that but those two
 
02:45:46.630 --> 02:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
things are intention and when push comes
 
02:45:48.670 --> 02:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
to shove the courts tend to favor the
 
02:45:50.670 --> 02:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
access to the ballot piece so I just
 
02:45:52.830 --> 02:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
want you to understand what I'm
 
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that the the fact that
 
02:45:57.790 --> 02:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
you're trying to bring it back into
 
02:45:59.630 --> 02:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
balance with what the Constitution
 
02:46:02.070 --> 02:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
requires that's a legitimate thing to do
 
02:46:03.590 --> 02:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
but understand that when you're cutting
 
02:46:07.070 --> 02:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
back on sort of the liberality of access
 
02:46:10.469 --> 02:46:10.479 align:start position:0%
to the ballot the courts are skeptical
 
02:46:12.389 --> 02:46:12.399 align:start position:0%
of that and you have to take that into
 
02:46:15.190 --> 02:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
account in what you put in the record to
 
02:46:20.469 --> 02:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:22.870 --> 02:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
change anyone
 
02:46:26.309 --> 02:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:29.389 --> 02:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
Mard thank you Mr chair so are you
 
02:46:34.389 --> 02:46:34.399 align:start position:0%
suggesting that um we need to be as
 
02:46:37.590 --> 02:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
legislate as legislators we need to be
 
02:46:40.070 --> 02:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
mindful of a
 
02:46:43.269 --> 02:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
perceived uh opposition from
 
02:46:45.389 --> 02:46:45.399 align:start position:0%
courts uh when we're looking to
 
02:46:47.590 --> 02:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
Institute legislation or or or get
 
02:46:52.230 --> 02:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
statute through that would be 100%
 
02:46:55.710 --> 02:46:55.720 align:start position:0%
constitutionally afforded ballot access
 
02:46:58.550 --> 02:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting that because it it
 
02:47:02.870 --> 02:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
might be uh viewed as um whatever the
 
02:47:04.190 --> 02:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
term of the day is voter
 
02:47:06.110 --> 02:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
disenfranchisement or or restricting
 
02:47:06.120 --> 02:47:07.110 align:start position:0%
disenfranchisement or or restricting
ballot

02:47:07.110 --> 02:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
02:47:09.429 --> 02:47:09.439 align:start position:0%
access that that needs to be a
 
02:47:11.670 --> 02:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
consideration when we're putting forth
 
02:47:15.630 --> 02:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
um election law uh type proposal that we
 
02:47:17.309 --> 02:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
need to look at how a Court's going to
 
02:47:21.389 --> 02:47:21.399 align:start position:0%
view this not how the Constitution does
 
02:47:22.510 --> 02:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
are you saying that those need to be
 
02:47:24.469 --> 02:47:24.479 align:start position:0%
weighted evenly one more than the other
 
02:47:26.190 --> 02:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
can you elaborate a little bit on that
 
02:47:28.469 --> 02:47:28.479 align:start position:0%
please if you accept the proposition
 
02:47:30.790 --> 02:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
that there can be disagreement over
 
02:47:33.830 --> 02:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
whether a law is constitutional I think
 
02:47:36.190 --> 02:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
we can all agree on that that that there
 
02:47:37.750 --> 02:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
can be
 
02:47:39.910 --> 02:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
disagreement then you have to be
 
02:47:41.990 --> 02:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
concerned because the courts have the
 
02:47:44.269 --> 02:47:44.279 align:start position:0%
last word on constitutionality at least
 
02:47:47.150 --> 02:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
under our current system you have to be
 
02:47:50.349 --> 02:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
concerned that what you pass as
 
02:47:52.950 --> 02:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
sincerely as you believe it's required
 
02:47:55.389 --> 02:47:55.399 align:start position:0%
by the Constitution if a majority of the
 
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court disagrees with
 
02:48:01.590 --> 02:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
you then as a legal matter you were
 
02:48:04.150 --> 02:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
wrong and the Constitution doesn't
 
02:48:06.469 --> 02:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
provide as you thought it did and what
 
02:48:10.190 --> 02:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
I'm suggesting is uh this is a matter of
 
02:48:12.510 --> 02:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
wisdom this is a matter of building the
 
02:48:14.429 --> 02:48:14.439 align:start position:0%
record so that whatever decision you
 
02:48:14.439 --> 02:48:16.030 align:start position:0%
record so that whatever decision you
make

02:48:16.030 --> 02:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:48:18.710 --> 02:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
and I I you know honestly agree with you
 
02:48:21.830 --> 02:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
that that absentee balloting got out of
 
02:48:25.110 --> 02:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
control in the in the you know during Co
 
02:48:27.790 --> 02:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
and so forth and needs to be dialed back
 
02:48:31.110 --> 02:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
but what I'm saying is build a record
 
02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
that makes that decision defensible in
 
02:48:36.550 --> 02:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
the courts it's not because it's my
 
02:48:38.550 --> 02:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
personal preference that you satisfy the
 
02:48:40.990 --> 02:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
courts it's the recognition that the
 
02:48:42.750 --> 02:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
courts are going to determine if there's
 
02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:43.790 align:start position:0%
courts are going to determine if there's
a

02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:48:47.349 --> 02:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
lawsuit whether that change is is
 
02:48:49.990 --> 02:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional so the smart thing to do
 
02:48:52.750 --> 02:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
is to build the legislative record so
 
02:48:55.550 --> 02:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
that that is a defensible decision
 
02:48:59.230 --> 02:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:05.510 --> 02:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
at further questions I have one um and
 
02:49:09.110 --> 02:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
and I'll um preface it by saying I
 
02:49:13.389 --> 02:49:13.399 align:start position:0%
didn't fully understand this so um the
 
02:49:15.429 --> 02:49:15.439 align:start position:0%
Brewin um
 
02:49:18.190 --> 02:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
level of scrutiny handled uh mentioned
 
02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:19.630 align:start position:0%
level of scrutiny handled uh mentioned
under

02:49:19.630 --> 02:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:49:22.830 --> 02:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
bruan it was said to me earlier in
 
02:49:25.429 --> 02:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
testimony or it was said to us earlier
 
02:49:25.439 --> 02:49:26.190 align:start position:0%
testimony or it was said to us earlier
in

02:49:26.190 --> 02:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:49:28.750 --> 02:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that because of
 
02:49:32.630 --> 02:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
bruan the other three methods or levels
 
02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:33.710 align:start position:0%
bruan the other three methods or levels
of

02:49:33.710 --> 02:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:49:38.590 --> 02:49:38.600 align:start position:0%
scrutiny um seem to be washed away by
 
02:49:43.190 --> 02:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
bruan um can you elaborate on or do you
 
02:49:46.990 --> 02:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
concur do you disagree do you I I think
 
02:49:49.469 --> 02:49:49.479 align:start position:0%
I heard you say that Bruin was specific
 
02:49:51.110 --> 02:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
to Second
 
02:49:54.309 --> 02:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment it was but it sounded to me
 
02:49:58.990 --> 02:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
like the prior testimony was that it was
 
02:50:01.469 --> 02:50:01.479 align:start position:0%
now going to be something that the
 
02:50:05.110 --> 02:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
legislature had to take into account um
 
02:50:08.030 --> 02:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
this new level rather than the prior
 
02:50:09.910 --> 02:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
three levels well if it's a second
 
02:50:11.550 --> 02:50:11.560 align:start position:0%
amendment regulation you would have to
 
02:50:16.670 --> 02:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
take it into account um what what
 
02:50:19.550 --> 02:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
Bruin I've never liked the different
 
02:50:22.150 --> 02:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
levels of scrutiny and Justice Thomas's
 
02:50:25.870 --> 02:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
opinion in bruan really explained why
 
02:50:28.150 --> 02:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
said you know at least in the Second
 
02:50:30.910 --> 02:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment context what we're doing is
 
02:50:33.309 --> 02:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
yielding power to the courts to make
 
02:50:35.630 --> 02:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
policy decisions if we allow the courts
 
02:50:37.590 --> 02:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
to say is this an important policy and
 
02:50:40.590 --> 02:50:40.600 align:start position:0%
are the means that you chose necessary
 
02:50:44.349 --> 02:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
or rationally related to that purpose
 
02:50:46.190 --> 02:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
you you can see how that shifts a lot of
 
02:50:51.469 --> 02:50:51.479 align:start position:0%
power to the courts and and
 
02:50:54.630 --> 02:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
Thomas uh gave that idea the back of his
 
02:50:57.870 --> 02:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
hand and bruan and said at least in the
 
02:50:59.830 --> 02:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment context what we're
 
02:51:03.590 --> 02:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
going to focus on
 
02:51:06.630 --> 02:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
is is the right that's an issue in this
 
02:51:11.229 --> 02:51:11.239 align:start position:0%
case carrying uh handgun in New York
 
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
City is that right uh cons consistent
 
02:51:16.670 --> 02:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
with the Second Amendment when it was
 
02:51:19.670 --> 02:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
adopted in the court it was clearly that
 
02:51:22.510 --> 02:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
people were allowed to carry uh their
 
02:51:24.229 --> 02:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
their uh
 
02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
weapons uh in public what the lower
 
02:51:30.429 --> 02:51:30.439 align:start position:0%
court did is it said okay now that we've
 
02:51:32.110 --> 02:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
determine that we're going to determine
 
02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
whether this
 
02:51:36.910 --> 02:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
restriction is
 
02:51:40.349 --> 02:51:40.359 align:start position:0%
uh is necessary to achieve this state
 
02:51:42.870 --> 02:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
policy and the Supreme Court said no
 
02:51:44.750 --> 02:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
you're not going to do that I all you're
 
02:51:46.910 --> 02:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
going to do is look at whether that
 
02:51:48.910 --> 02:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
proposed restriction is consistent with
 
02:51:50.590 --> 02:51:50.600 align:start position:0%
the kinds of restrictions that were in
 
02:51:52.550 --> 02:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
place when the second amendment was
 
02:51:55.950 --> 02:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
adopted and if it is inconsistent then
 
02:51:55.960 --> 02:51:57.510 align:start position:0%
adopted and if it is inconsistent then
it's

02:51:57.510 --> 02:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:51:59.790 --> 02:51:59.800 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so bruan
 
02:52:03.070 --> 02:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
made Second Amendment law very simple
 
02:52:04.389 --> 02:52:04.399 align:start position:0%
bruan did
 
02:52:08.269 --> 02:52:08.279 align:start position:0%
not uh revoke this means ends test you
 
02:52:10.550 --> 02:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
know strict scrutiny intermediate
 
02:52:14.190 --> 02:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
scrutiny and uh rational basis across
 
02:52:17.269 --> 02:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
the board Court um a lot of
 
02:52:19.630 --> 02:52:19.640 align:start position:0%
conservatives have sort of jumped on it
 
02:52:21.429 --> 02:52:21.439 align:start position:0%
and said oh this signals that the
 
02:52:23.229 --> 02:52:23.239 align:start position:0%
Court's abandoning
 
02:52:25.590 --> 02:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
that that's not the way lawyers look at
 
02:52:27.590 --> 02:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
things until the Supreme Court says and
 
02:52:29.070 --> 02:52:29.080 align:start position:0%
by the way we're doing away with all
 
02:52:31.710 --> 02:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
these means and testing we assume that
 
02:52:34.229 --> 02:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
it's still in place more importantly
 
02:52:36.070 --> 02:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
under the New Hampshire
 
02:52:38.510 --> 02:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution our Supreme Court uses
 
02:52:40.150 --> 02:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
means ends
 
02:52:43.229 --> 02:52:43.239 align:start position:0%
testing so unless the issue is a federal
 
02:52:44.990 --> 02:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
an issue of federal law
 
02:52:46.269 --> 02:52:46.279 align:start position:0%
and this would be under the State
 
02:52:48.630 --> 02:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution which is being argued here
 
02:52:50.670 --> 02:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
the means ends test is still in place in
 
02:52:53.110 --> 02:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there's nothing about
 
02:52:56.269 --> 02:52:56.279 align:start position:0%
Bruin that changes that for a question
 
02:52:57.870 --> 02:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
of state
 
02:53:00.710 --> 02:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
law I don't know if I cleared it up or
 
02:53:04.229 --> 02:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
made it worse um I'll have to get back
 
02:53:05.030 --> 02:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
to you
 
02:53:08.469 --> 02:53:08.479 align:start position:0%
on I'm sorry I appreciate the uh the
 
02:53:10.670 --> 02:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
answer however um are there any further
 
02:53:12.429 --> 02:53:12.439 align:start position:0%
questions uh
 
02:53:15.190 --> 02:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
rep thank you Mr chair and I'll admit
 
02:53:18.070 --> 02:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
this stuff gets pretty deep and I'm no
 
02:53:21.670 --> 02:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
expert on it but it uh questions come to
 
02:53:24.030 --> 02:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
mind and and and thoughts and stuff and
 
02:53:27.349 --> 02:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
you know didn't in the New Hampshire
 
02:53:32.950 --> 02:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court uh W Wier I think Wier
 
02:53:37.110 --> 02:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
versus Plymouth um call the people
 
02:53:39.150 --> 02:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
granters and therefore don't the
 
02:53:41.389 --> 02:53:41.399 align:start position:0%
granters aren't the ones aren't they the
 
02:53:43.349 --> 02:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
ones that create
 
02:53:43.359 --> 02:53:45.590 align:start position:0%
ones that create
Trust

02:53:45.590 --> 02:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
Trust
 
02:53:47.510 --> 02:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
I mean if it's already been stated that
 
02:53:49.110 --> 02:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
where the grant is and the grant is
 
02:53:51.190 --> 02:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
we're the ones that create a trust isn't
 
02:53:53.309 --> 02:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
that correct well to some extent it's
 
02:53:55.309 --> 02:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
just a question of terminology right
 
02:53:59.550 --> 02:53:59.560 align:start position:0%
because the because the um there's no
 
02:54:03.070 --> 02:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
question but from from the earliest
 
02:54:04.870 --> 02:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
articles in the Constitution that the
 
02:54:06.429 --> 02:54:06.439 align:start position:0%
authority of the legislature comes from
 
02:54:09.269 --> 02:54:09.279 align:start position:0%
the people through their consent so
 
02:54:10.750 --> 02:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
that's really
 
02:54:12.910 --> 02:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
indisputable what I'm saying is that
 
02:54:17.070 --> 02:54:17.080 align:start position:0%
that the Constitution does not refer to
 
02:54:20.349 --> 02:54:20.359 align:start position:0%
itself as a trust instrument there is
 
02:54:23.309 --> 02:54:23.319 align:start position:0%
one reference in the oath section which
 
02:54:26.630 --> 02:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
is part two article 84 to whether an
 
02:54:28.670 --> 02:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
officer I think believe the languages
 
02:54:31.950 --> 02:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
accepts the trust uh as a result of
 
02:54:31.960 --> 02:54:33.469 align:start position:0%
accepts the trust uh as a result of
being

02:54:33.469 --> 02:54:33.479 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:54:36.309 --> 02:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
elected but to extrapolate from that to
 
02:54:38.750 --> 02:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
the entire Constitution is a trust
 
02:54:40.830 --> 02:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
instrument understand that my point is
 
02:54:43.630 --> 02:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
not is it in fact a trust instrument my
 
02:54:46.070 --> 02:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
point is how do the courts look at that
 
02:54:49.030 --> 02:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
do the courts look at that and say
 
02:54:51.309 --> 02:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
that's a very eccentric view of the law
 
02:54:53.030 --> 02:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
that is not some that's not the way we
 
02:54:57.269 --> 02:54:57.279 align:start position:0%
normally think about this so just be
 
02:54:59.830 --> 02:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
aware that if you if you choose to go
 
02:55:01.349 --> 02:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
down that
 
02:55:04.229 --> 02:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
path have a you know have have a lawyer
 
02:55:06.110 --> 02:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
look at it and determine whether this is
 
02:55:08.110 --> 02:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
actually language that's consistent with
 
02:55:10.229 --> 02:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
the way the courts think about this
 
02:55:13.550 --> 02:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
stuff because if you don't do that then
 
02:55:15.790 --> 02:55:15.800 align:start position:0%
when it lands on a judge's desk the
 
02:55:18.269 --> 02:55:18.279 align:start position:0%
judge says I've never understood this to
 
02:55:20.349 --> 02:55:20.359 align:start position:0%
be a
 
02:55:23.110 --> 02:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
trust Okay I lied it wasn't the last
 
02:55:23.120 --> 02:55:24.830 align:start position:0%
trust Okay I lied it wasn't the last
question

02:55:24.830 --> 02:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:55:29.229 --> 02:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
um how am I am am I five minutes up yeah
 
02:55:31.309 --> 02:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
well that was five minutes of testimony
 
02:55:35.870 --> 02:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
the questions don't add five minutes um
 
02:55:37.910 --> 02:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
my question is and I'm not going to lose
 
02:55:42.070 --> 02:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to ask um my question is
 
02:55:44.710 --> 02:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
how we how this
 
02:55:48.150 --> 02:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
could have been done differently or
 
02:55:50.590 --> 02:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
could it have been done differently as
 
02:55:52.870 --> 02:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
requesting an opinion of the justices
 
02:55:55.670 --> 02:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
prior yes could you comment on that yeah
 
02:55:57.590 --> 02:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
and that's the mechanism of course under
 
02:56:00.510 --> 02:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
our constitution for determining uh
 
02:56:04.349 --> 02:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
whether um a a statute proposed or
 
02:56:06.630 --> 02:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
existing um particularly in connection
 
02:56:08.550 --> 02:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
with legislation that would proport to
 
02:56:10.550 --> 02:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
change it you could send it to the
 
02:56:12.389 --> 02:56:12.399 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and say give us an opinion
 
02:56:14.910 --> 02:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
an advisory opinion and as to whether
 
02:56:18.510 --> 02:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
this law uh exceeds the authority uh
 
02:56:21.150 --> 02:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
granted to the legislature under the
 
02:56:23.110 --> 02:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution that's the that's the
 
02:56:26.830 --> 02:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
straightforward way of doing it um and
 
02:56:30.110 --> 02:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
you avoid all of the it's it's a much
 
02:56:32.750 --> 02:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
quicker way of getting an answer and you
 
02:56:34.710 --> 02:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
don't take the risk that you do with
 
02:56:37.150 --> 02:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
passing something that's as sort of
 
02:56:40.630 --> 02:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
Arcane as this resolution run it through
 
02:56:42.110 --> 02:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court then up to the
 
02:56:45.070 --> 02:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court you have a quicker answer
 
02:56:46.950 --> 02:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
and that is the way the Constitution
 
02:56:48.670 --> 02:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
contemplates that these kinds of issues
 
02:56:50.870 --> 02:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
would be presented to the
 
02:56:53.190 --> 02:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
court thank you I think that it does
 
02:56:54.750 --> 02:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
answer my question but I have to think
 
02:56:59.190 --> 02:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
that through too um anyone else
 
02:57:01.710 --> 02:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
yes no that's
 
02:57:04.870 --> 02:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
fine so thank you again for I'm just
 
02:57:07.150 --> 02:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
glad I piqued your interest in it you I
 
02:57:09.070 --> 02:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
you're you you have a lot of information
 
02:57:10.750 --> 02:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
in your noggin that I probably could
 
02:57:13.790 --> 02:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
afford to learn from um are you saying
 
02:57:17.229 --> 02:57:17.239 align:start position:0%
that if we were to send for this house
 
02:57:19.349 --> 02:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
resolution to the New Hampshire Supreme
 
02:57:22.150 --> 02:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
Court and ask for an advisory opinion
 
02:57:24.030 --> 02:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
that that would be a prudent thing to do
 
02:57:27.550 --> 02:57:27.560 align:start position:0%
no okay I'm saying I don't think this I
 
02:57:29.110 --> 02:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
don't think this resolution is a good
 
02:57:30.750 --> 02:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
idea I think if you want to accomplish
 
02:57:33.150 --> 02:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
the underlying policy goals that is
 
02:57:36.229 --> 02:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
restricting absentee balloting and
 
02:57:39.510 --> 02:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
restricting access to machines you ought
 
02:57:43.710 --> 02:57:43.720 align:start position:0%
to maybe amend this somehow or or put
 
02:57:46.790 --> 02:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
forward legislation that does that and
 
02:57:49.429 --> 02:57:49.439 align:start position:0%
ask the court whether existing law
 
02:57:52.110 --> 02:57:52.120 align:start position:0%
whether this bill is consistent the
 
02:57:54.710 --> 02:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
proposed bill is consistent with the the
 
02:57:56.469 --> 02:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
Constitution and whether existing law is
 
02:57:57.990 --> 02:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
consistent with the Constitution that's
 
02:57:59.910 --> 02:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm
 
02:58:02.870 --> 02:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
saying see that I'm glad you asked that
 
02:58:07.349 --> 02:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you um I appreciate it um
 
02:58:10.870 --> 02:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
I think we appreciate your testimony um
 
02:58:14.229 --> 02:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
I have no further pink cards right I
 
02:58:15.950 --> 02:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
think we did for the right bill they
 
02:58:18.510 --> 02:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
have no other pin cards I'll close the
 
02:58:23.229 --> 02:58:23.239 align:start position:0%
hearing um on house resolution 25 uh it
 
02:58:27.910 --> 02:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
is almost perfectly the right
 
02:58:31.429 --> 02:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
timing um what I would like to do I've
 
02:58:33.190 --> 02:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
closed the hearing on
 
02:58:37.630 --> 02:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
hr25 um I would like to
 
02:58:42.630 --> 02:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:47.910 --> 02:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
1367 and recess it to a Time certain or
 
02:58:50.590 --> 02:58:50.600 align:start position:0%
move it to a Time certain that would be
 
02:58:51.750 --> 02:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:58:55.229 --> 02:58:55.239 align:start position:0%
2:00 and the reason for that is uh the
 
02:58:58.389 --> 02:58:58.399 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of that bill as well as
 
02:59:01.950 --> 02:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
the bill that's due for 140 happens to
 
02:59:06.309 --> 02:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
be the same time
 
02:59:08.830 --> 02:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
um what's
 
02:59:12.309 --> 02:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
that yep
 
02:59:17.990 --> 02:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
um uh then uh the house bill
 
02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:19.830 align:start position:0%
um uh then uh the house bill
12

02:59:19.830 --> 02:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
12
 
02:59:22.110 --> 02:59:22.120 align:start position:0%

03:54:07.880 --> 04:05:58.830 align:start position:0%
 
own

04:05:58.830 --> 04:05:58.840 align:start position:0%

good
 
04:06:02.950 --> 04:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon it is a little past one we're
 
04:06:05.830 --> 04:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
going to open up the hearing for um
 
04:06:08.950 --> 04:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1309 and we have the prime
 
04:06:11.710 --> 04:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
sponsor here representative Weber if
 
04:06:15.590 --> 04:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:17.710 --> 04:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
start thank you madam chair and
 
04:06:22.590 --> 04:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
committee members uh this bill is um
 
04:06:24.750 --> 04:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
arises out of concern for transparency
 
04:06:26.429 --> 04:06:26.439 align:start position:0%
in our governmental
 
04:06:28.349 --> 04:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
processes and it's something I've been
 
04:06:29.910 --> 04:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about for a long time but
 
04:06:33.510 --> 04:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten to uh but here's the
 
04:06:35.550 --> 04:06:35.560 align:start position:0%
thing we in the house have deadlines to
 
04:06:38.790 --> 04:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
get our bills out we know when those are
 
04:06:41.790 --> 04:06:41.800 align:start position:0%
uh and when they go to the body that is
 
04:06:43.750 --> 04:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
not supposed to be named they too have
 
04:06:45.750 --> 04:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
deadlines so we know where the bills are
 
04:06:47.550 --> 04:06:47.560 align:start position:0%
and what's happening with them and
 
04:06:50.550 --> 04:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
they're also docketed in our docketing
 
04:06:53.830 --> 04:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
system so we know what has happened and
 
04:06:55.990 --> 04:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
what's likely to happen
 
04:06:58.950 --> 04:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
soon and so a bill passes the house and
 
04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
it passes the Senate and what happens
 
04:07:02.229 --> 04:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
then well we all know it goes to the
 
04:07:03.830 --> 04:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
governor but before it goes to the
 
04:07:06.990 --> 04:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
governor it gets signed it gets enrolled
 
04:07:09.790 --> 04:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
and that's a process process and then it
 
04:07:12.910 --> 04:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
uh goes to the Speaker of the House for
 
04:07:15.269 --> 04:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
Signature and then it goes to the
 
04:07:17.590 --> 04:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
president of the senate for Signature
 
04:07:20.149 --> 04:07:20.159 align:start position:0%
and they have no deadlines and you may
 
04:07:21.910 --> 04:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
have noticed that some bills don't get
 
04:07:25.510 --> 04:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
signed till July or August maybe even
 
04:07:29.550 --> 04:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
and so I know my limits and I didn't
 
04:07:31.550 --> 04:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
want to interfere with the prerogatives
 
04:07:34.510 --> 04:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
either of the um speaker of the house or
 
04:07:37.070 --> 04:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
the senate or the president but I do
 
04:07:39.229 --> 04:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
want people to know where the bills are
 
04:07:42.269 --> 04:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
and I will just tell you one small
 
04:07:45.830 --> 04:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
example I had when I sat on uh
 
04:07:49.750 --> 04:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
Ed I had a bill that
 
04:07:53.349 --> 04:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
conformed the statute on Commercial
 
04:07:56.590 --> 04:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
appraisers in New Hampshire to a federal
 
04:07:59.030 --> 04:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
requirement and what we had been told in
 
04:08:01.910 --> 04:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
the hearing which we expedited in
 
04:08:04.710 --> 04:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
February was that if this bill was not
 
04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
signed by January 1st all all of the
 
04:08:09.990 --> 04:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
commercial appraisers would be
 
04:08:12.389 --> 04:08:12.399 align:start position:0%
desertified for federal
 
04:08:16.109 --> 04:08:16.119 align:start position:0%
purposes and this was going to have a
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
terrible problem for a lot of people in
 
04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so when we
 
04:08:24.229 --> 04:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
got to June 28th and the bill still had
 
04:08:26.469 --> 04:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
not progressed to the governor's
 
04:08:29.189 --> 04:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
desk um I went to the Secretary of
 
04:08:31.469 --> 04:08:31.479 align:start position:0%
State's office and said what's happening
 
04:08:32.990 --> 04:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
with the bill and they said it's at the
 
04:08:34.950 --> 04:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
Senate president's office and I went to
 
04:08:36.750 --> 04:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate president's office and I said
 
04:08:38.070 --> 04:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
what's happening with the Bill and they
 
04:08:40.229 --> 04:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
said we don't have it and I went
 
04:08:42.309 --> 04:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
downstairs to the Secretary of State's
 
04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
office and I got somebody from the
 
04:08:47.790 --> 04:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
office to come upstairs and say yes it
 
04:08:49.910 --> 04:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
is in the Senate president's office and
 
04:08:51.670 --> 04:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
at that point the way they knew that was
 
04:08:54.630 --> 04:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
because they had a spiralbound notebook
 
04:08:57.630 --> 04:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
which was uh cross referenced only by
 
04:09:00.030 --> 04:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
date as to what Bill had been carried
 
04:09:02.550 --> 04:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
where by the Secretary of State's office
 
04:09:04.910 --> 04:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
cuz that office handles passing the
 
04:09:08.950 --> 04:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
bills around and with some discussion
 
04:09:12.790 --> 04:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
about how do we let both representatives
 
04:09:14.670 --> 04:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
and our staff here and members of the
 
04:09:17.910 --> 04:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
public know where the bills are this
 
04:09:20.590 --> 04:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
seemed to me to be the easiest way to do
 
04:09:22.670 --> 04:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
it we had some discussion at some point
 
04:09:24.910 --> 04:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
I think about trying to include it in
 
04:09:26.990 --> 04:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
our docket system and that's going to be
 
04:09:28.830 --> 04:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
a problem with our docket system and the
 
04:09:32.349 --> 04:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
clerk is here to talk about that um I
 
04:09:34.429 --> 04:09:34.439 align:start position:0%
know there are issues with the Secretary
 
04:09:38.229 --> 04:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
of State's website so that's why
 
04:09:38.239 --> 04:09:39.550 align:start position:0%
of State's website so that's why
I

04:09:39.550 --> 04:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:09:44.030 --> 04:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
um uh referenced either the secretar of
 
04:09:46.990 --> 04:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
state's website or on a public website
 
04:09:49.670 --> 04:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
linked to its Secretary of State's
 
04:09:51.189 --> 04:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
website because I thought there might be
 
04:09:54.469 --> 04:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
something off the shelf that was easy to
 
04:09:57.550 --> 04:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
install and put up that might be easier
 
04:10:00.990 --> 04:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
than actually redoing their entire
 
04:10:01.000 --> 04:10:03.070 align:start position:0%
than actually redoing their entire
website

04:10:03.070 --> 04:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
website
 
04:10:07.710 --> 04:10:07.720 align:start position:0%
structure so um the choice is up to to
 
04:10:10.349 --> 04:10:10.359 align:start position:0%
them as to how this is implemented and I
 
04:10:12.349 --> 04:10:12.359 align:start position:0%
want it to be as flexible as possible I
 
04:10:14.950 --> 04:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
just want members of the public members
 
04:10:17.630 --> 04:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
of the General Court members of our
 
04:10:20.269 --> 04:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
staff uh and anybody who wants to know
 
04:10:22.910 --> 04:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to figure out where a bill is
 
04:10:25.630 --> 04:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
between the time it passes the second
 
04:10:29.030 --> 04:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
body and gets to the governor's desk so
 
04:10:30.910 --> 04:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of this legislation
 
04:10:34.870 --> 04:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
and I leave it in your competent hands I
 
04:10:36.950 --> 04:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
I will just signal for the committee I
 
04:10:38.590 --> 04:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
my understanding was there was a certain
 
04:10:40.790 --> 04:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
amount of um either sign-ins or
 
04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
testimony given online for people who
 
04:10:45.750 --> 04:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here today but thank you
 
04:10:47.349 --> 04:10:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
04:10:49.469 --> 04:10:49.479 align:start position:0%
will you take
 
04:10:52.830 --> 04:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions yes
 
04:10:55.469 --> 04:10:55.479 align:start position:0%
re thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:10:56.670 --> 04:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
uh for your
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
testimony I
 
04:11:01.830 --> 04:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
use I I read through this before today
 
04:11:04.389 --> 04:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
and I was kind of almost appalled that
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
we actually need to put in
 
04:11:08.990 --> 04:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
legislation to facilitate something like
 
04:11:10.990 --> 04:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
this that it's not just a simple it
 
04:11:11.000 --> 04:11:11.950 align:start position:0%
this that it's not just a simple it
thing

04:11:11.950 --> 04:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:11:14.269 --> 04:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
or whoever the person is you know
 
04:11:16.030 --> 04:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
someone smarter than me in that space
 
04:11:18.910 --> 04:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
obviously but there really needs to be
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
legislation to have them enact or make a
 
04:11:23.950 --> 04:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
portal for this kind of
 
04:11:27.910 --> 04:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
stuff I will be the first to admit that
 
04:11:30.469 --> 04:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
I have had a pretty
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
um heavyduty extracurricular time of the
 
04:11:37.830 --> 04:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
last year and so I Poss possibly could
 
04:11:39.469 --> 04:11:39.479 align:start position:0%
have gone to the Secretary of State's
 
04:11:42.469 --> 04:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
office and asked them to do this uh I
 
04:11:44.990 --> 04:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
did not do that and and more shame to me
 
04:11:46.950 --> 04:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
for not having done that because
 
04:11:50.550 --> 04:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
certainly they could do this but having
 
04:11:56.030 --> 04:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
had a lot of experience with um various
 
04:11:58.750 --> 04:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
agencies within the state many of whom
 
04:12:02.950 --> 04:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
operate with uh very ancient programs
 
04:12:07.269 --> 04:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
and and it stuff uh I know that up
 
04:12:09.309 --> 04:12:09.319 align:start position:0%
updating things and just making a change
 
04:12:12.670 --> 04:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
is not always the easiest thing to do uh
 
04:12:14.550 --> 04:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
but I also wanted to be sure we got it
 
04:12:17.590 --> 04:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
done so I thought whether this bill
 
04:12:20.590 --> 04:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
becomes a vehicle for a conversation and
 
04:12:23.229 --> 04:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
a promise or whether this bill becomes
 
04:12:26.309 --> 04:12:26.319 align:start position:0%
law uh I wanted to be sure that we were
 
04:12:31.469 --> 04:12:31.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:35.189 --> 04:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
attention any other questions from the
 
04:12:37.229 --> 04:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much thank
 
04:12:42.950 --> 04:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:46.269 --> 04:12:46.279 align:start position:0%
home I'd like to call up um house clerk
 
04:12:46.279 --> 04:12:52.189 align:start position:0%
home I'd like to call up um house clerk
Paul

04:12:52.189 --> 04:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:54.590 --> 04:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you madam chair and members
 
04:12:56.189 --> 04:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record Paul
 
04:12:58.750 --> 04:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
Smith Clerk of the house um as you know
 
04:13:01.469 --> 04:13:01.479 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to testify in opposition or
 
04:13:04.950 --> 04:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
supportive legislation however um I'm
 
04:13:09.030 --> 04:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
just skirting that because this
 
04:13:12.070 --> 04:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
legislation will be incredibly helpful
 
04:13:14.229 --> 04:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
to the legislative process it will be
 
04:13:17.630 --> 04:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
incredibly helpful because for months
 
04:13:19.830 --> 04:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
between usually
 
04:13:24.309 --> 04:13:24.319 align:start position:0%
May and sometimes up until
 
04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
October I'm getting calls from the
 
04:13:28.790 --> 04:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
public saying this bill passed on March
 
04:13:31.870 --> 04:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
30th why has this not been put to the
 
04:13:35.990 --> 04:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
governor Etc and I can't tell them I
 
04:13:38.309 --> 04:13:38.319 align:start position:0%
can't tell them where the bill is I
 
04:13:41.229 --> 04:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
can't tell them if it has if it's
 
04:13:43.429 --> 04:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
stalled in the speaker's office or if
 
04:13:45.590 --> 04:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's stalled in the Senate president's
 
04:13:48.710 --> 04:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
office but yes they have stalled in
 
04:13:51.030 --> 04:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
those offices as a matter of fact a
 
04:13:54.830 --> 04:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago uh a a former Senate
 
04:13:57.750 --> 04:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
President who is still in the Senate uh
 
04:14:01.269 --> 04:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
held on to a bill until almost October
 
04:14:05.070 --> 04:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
and that is a very long time when a bill
 
04:14:08.389 --> 04:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
passes in June uh just to just to
 
04:14:11.429 --> 04:14:11.439 align:start position:0%
reiterate the the enrolling process
 
04:14:13.710 --> 04:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
after a bill passes both bodies it goes
 
04:14:16.149 --> 04:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
to the office of legislative Services
 
04:14:17.910 --> 04:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
the office of legislative services at
 
04:14:20.630 --> 04:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
that time determines if an additional
 
04:14:22.469 --> 04:14:22.479 align:start position:0%
enrolled Bill Amendment needs to be
 
04:14:24.870 --> 04:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
drafted an enrolled Bill Amendment uh
 
04:14:29.189 --> 04:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
usually will fix typos um RSA references
 
04:14:31.870 --> 04:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
that are incorrect uh effective dates
 
04:14:33.910 --> 04:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
Etc so that's the purpose of the
 
04:14:36.030 --> 04:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
enrolled Bill Amendment the enrolled
 
04:14:38.710 --> 04:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
Bill amendment is then sent to both
 
04:14:41.910 --> 04:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
bodies the house and the Senate where
 
04:14:45.030 --> 04:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment is acted on now as you
 
04:14:47.070 --> 04:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
know at the end of a regular session of
 
04:14:49.469 --> 04:14:49.479 align:start position:0%
the house we recess we recess for the
 
04:14:51.389 --> 04:14:51.399 align:start position:0%
ability to do certain things one of
 
04:14:53.550 --> 04:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
those things is adopt and ruled Bill
 
04:14:55.950 --> 04:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
amendments these are ministerial things
 
04:14:57.990 --> 04:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
these are things that don't require a
 
04:15:01.109 --> 04:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
full vote of the body to do and so we do
 
04:15:03.510 --> 04:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
those in recess after the enrolled Bill
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
amendment is processed it is then
 
04:15:07.670 --> 04:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
delivered from the office of legislative
 
04:15:09.830 --> 04:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
services to the Secretary of State's
 
04:15:13.030 --> 04:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
office the Secretary of State transmits
 
04:15:15.229 --> 04:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
the bill to the speaker's office for the
 
04:15:15.239 --> 04:15:16.269 align:start position:0%
the bill to the speaker's office for the
speaker

04:15:16.269 --> 04:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
04:15:18.670 --> 04:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
signature once that's done the speaker
 
04:15:20.950 --> 04:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
sends all of those bills back to the
 
04:15:22.590 --> 04:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office the
 
04:15:25.030 --> 04:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State then delivers the
 
04:15:27.070 --> 04:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
bill to the Senate president's office
 
04:15:29.510 --> 04:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
when those bills are returned then the
 
04:15:32.109 --> 04:15:32.119 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State processes them to go
 
04:15:33.389 --> 04:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
to the governor and as you know the
 
04:15:36.790 --> 04:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
governor has 5 days to sign a bill or
 
04:15:38.510 --> 04:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
let let it become law without signature
 
04:15:41.870 --> 04:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
or veto a bill so that's the process in
 
04:15:45.550 --> 04:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
a nutshell but again this this
 
04:15:47.670 --> 04:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
legislation will definitely help
 
04:15:50.429 --> 04:15:50.439 align:start position:0%
increase transparency in the legislature
 
04:15:53.109 --> 04:15:53.119 align:start position:0%
to represented mccarter's question uh
 
04:15:55.149 --> 04:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes I do think you need
 
04:15:57.870 --> 04:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
legislation for this purpose
 
04:15:59.710 --> 04:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
because in dealing with a
 
04:16:02.790 --> 04:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
non-legislative body and I'm I'm using
 
04:16:05.349 --> 04:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
that term generally uh in dealing with a
 
04:16:07.590 --> 04:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
non-legislative body in in order to make
 
04:16:09.790 --> 04:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
change in government you
 
04:16:12.790 --> 04:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
need you sometimes need the sword as
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
well as the pen and the the sword of
 
04:16:18.309 --> 04:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
legislation is likely the the way to
 
04:16:21.229 --> 04:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
make things happen in this case and as
 
04:16:24.429 --> 04:16:24.439 align:start position:0%
as an administrator in a sense of the
 
04:16:26.229 --> 04:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
website and the information that goes on
 
04:16:29.910 --> 04:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
our website um there are certain things
 
04:16:31.710 --> 04:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
uh for example the the Senate amended
 
04:16:33.950 --> 04:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
house Bills or the committee of
 
04:16:36.389 --> 04:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
conference page those are things that I
 
04:16:39.189 --> 04:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
can up update via
 
04:16:42.070 --> 04:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
PDF so this is something that the
 
04:16:44.109 --> 04:16:44.119 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office regardless
 
04:16:47.269 --> 04:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
of whatever Century they may be in may
 
04:16:49.830 --> 04:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
be able to just update something as
 
04:16:53.750 --> 04:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
simple as a PDF on their website so uh I
 
04:16:55.830 --> 04:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
do think to to answer your question that
 
04:17:02.309 --> 04:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:04.910 --> 04:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
sense representative wall thank you
 
04:17:08.189 --> 04:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
madam chairman um this this is um I have
 
04:17:10.590 --> 04:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
signed bills as chairman of ledge
 
04:17:12.109 --> 04:17:12.119 align:start position:0%
Administration before because that's
 
04:17:14.109 --> 04:17:14.119 align:start position:0%
what happens in part of the process is
 
04:17:15.790 --> 04:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
when the bill goes to the Secretary of
 
04:17:19.790 --> 04:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
State uh what about OS could the holdup
 
04:17:22.030 --> 04:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
be down there where where's the snag
 
04:17:25.670 --> 04:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:30.389 --> 04:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
know the short answer is I
 
04:17:33.070 --> 04:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
don't there is a longer answer but we'll
 
04:17:34.830 --> 04:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
we can have that over coffee
 
04:17:38.870 --> 04:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
sometime follow follow up okay so this
 
04:17:40.750 --> 04:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
this bill definitely should help the
 
04:17:43.830 --> 04:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
process I hope but I'm wondering how we
 
04:17:46.910 --> 04:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
might find where the real slowdown is
 
04:17:49.469 --> 04:17:49.479 align:start position:0%
and what we might do to expedite things
 
04:17:51.790 --> 04:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
through OS representative I do think
 
04:17:53.950 --> 04:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
that you know obviously OS you have to
 
04:17:57.510 --> 04:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
remember is handling legislation in in
 
04:17:59.590 --> 04:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
in all aspects they're dealing with your
 
04:18:00.910 --> 04:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
floor amendments they're dealing with
 
04:18:03.109 --> 04:18:03.119 align:start position:0%
committee amendments so they are while
 
04:18:05.229 --> 04:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
we are also going through the process of
 
04:18:07.189 --> 04:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
of dealing with bills uh in the
 
04:18:09.910 --> 04:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
enrolling process we are still actively
 
04:18:13.109 --> 04:18:13.119 align:start position:0%
acting on legislation on the floor so I
 
04:18:15.750 --> 04:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm loathed to suggest that OS is is
 
04:18:17.870 --> 04:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
a holdup here uh this specific
 
04:18:21.990 --> 04:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
legislation is is just to encourage a uh
 
04:18:24.309 --> 04:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
a tracking mechanism for once it gets to
 
04:18:26.349 --> 04:18:26.359 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office which I
 
04:18:29.630 --> 04:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:31.630 --> 04:18:31.640 align:start position:0%
acceptable reprentative
 
04:18:35.830 --> 04:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
mcarter thank you madam chair so my
 
04:18:38.710 --> 04:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
understanding is this is only only a a a
 
04:18:42.269 --> 04:18:42.279 align:start position:0%
portal or or a website um database
 
04:18:44.750 --> 04:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
however you want to word it that shows
 
04:18:46.429 --> 04:18:46.439 align:start position:0%
where the bill is in the process it's
 
04:18:48.830 --> 04:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
not doing anything to rectify the
 
04:18:52.590 --> 04:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
expediency of the process
 
04:18:56.790 --> 04:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
correct it doesn't but I I'm not sure
 
04:18:59.990 --> 04:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
that there is a way to expedite the
 
04:19:03.990 --> 04:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
process in in that regard
 
04:19:06.109 --> 04:19:06.119 align:start position:0%
um there are some political
 
04:19:06.119 --> 04:19:07.229 align:start position:0%
um there are some political
considerations

04:19:07.229 --> 04:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
considerations
 
04:19:09.950 --> 04:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
there are some timing considerations
 
04:19:12.189 --> 04:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
there there frequently are requests from
 
04:19:14.990 --> 04:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
the executive to hold a bill for um an
 
04:19:17.349 --> 04:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
extra week because uh they want to do a
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
ceremonial signing and inv invite all
 
04:19:22.710 --> 04:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
the right people Etc so um I'm I'm not
 
04:19:28.269 --> 04:19:28.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:30.790 --> 04:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
conversation any other
 
04:19:32.670 --> 04:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:35.640 --> 04:19:39.429 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:19:39.429 --> 04:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:43.349 --> 04:19:43.359 align:start position:0%
seeing no one else with a pink card um
 
04:19:43.359 --> 04:19:48.229 align:start position:0%
seeing no one else with a pink card um
oh

04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:50.550 --> 04:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
yes if you'd like to come up and answer
 
04:19:53.830 --> 04:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:56.269 --> 04:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
fine thank you for the Indulgence and
 
04:19:58.710 --> 04:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it was very
 
04:20:02.389 --> 04:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
clear to me that if we interfered with
 
04:20:04.109 --> 04:20:04.119 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
process this will not this will not
 
04:20:09.750 --> 04:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
happen but if the members of the public
 
04:20:12.590 --> 04:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
know where a bill is they know the right
 
04:20:16.710 --> 04:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
person to call to say what's happening
 
04:20:20.109 --> 04:20:20.119 align:start position:0%
and that might sharpen people's uh
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
willingness to move it along or people
 
04:20:25.349 --> 04:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
might get a very good uh response as to
 
04:20:27.070 --> 04:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
why what's happening is happening I
 
04:20:28.389 --> 04:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
didn't want to interfere with the
 
04:20:30.590 --> 04:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
flexibility I just want to know what's
 
04:20:33.349 --> 04:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
going on thank
 
04:20:37.149 --> 04:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you and uh seeing no other
 
04:20:41.429 --> 04:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
pink cards uh for House Bill 1309 I'm
 
04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:05.439 --> 04:24:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
1309

04:24:24.950 --> 04:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:26.630 --> 04:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
good morning I mean good
 
04:24:29.670 --> 04:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon it uh is a little past 1:20
 
04:24:31.309 --> 04:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to open up the hearing for
 
04:24:31.319 --> 04:24:32.910 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to open up the hearing for
HB

04:24:32.910 --> 04:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
HB
 
04:24:35.630 --> 04:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
1434 and I would like to call the prime
 
04:24:40.950 --> 04:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:42.950 --> 04:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
Moffett thank you
 
04:24:45.710 --> 04:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
m thank you madam chair good morning and
 
04:24:48.790 --> 04:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
good afternoon to you too
 
04:24:51.389 --> 04:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
welcome uh thank you uh for the
 
04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
record uh I'm representative Mike
 
04:24:57.229 --> 04:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
Moffett uh representing marac District 4
 
04:25:00.510 --> 04:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
in the lovely towns of canabury and
 
04:25:03.229 --> 04:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
Lowden so this measure of 1434 has been
 
04:25:05.269 --> 04:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
in the mix before uh this version
 
04:25:07.309 --> 04:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
includes some new language and some
 
04:25:10.229 --> 04:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
compromises that reflect uh some earlier
 
04:25:12.790 --> 04:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
testimony and feedback that we have
 
04:25:16.630 --> 04:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
received uh the flag design is from uh a
 
04:25:19.910 --> 04:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
National Organization honor and remember
 
04:25:22.990 --> 04:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
Inc and uh I emailed a photo of it to
 
04:25:26.309 --> 04:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
this committee uh earlier this morning
 
04:25:28.950 --> 04:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh along with my brief testimony so you
 
04:25:30.670 --> 04:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
have you should have that and I gave a
 
04:25:34.710 --> 04:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
hard copy to uh uh representative
 
04:25:37.269 --> 04:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
Hobson uh so I understand early concerns
 
04:25:40.550 --> 04:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
about this uh flag potentially did the
 
04:25:42.269 --> 04:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
the concerns in the past have been the
 
04:25:46.670 --> 04:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
flag among others concerns uh concerns
 
04:25:48.950 --> 04:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
about the flag detracting from the
 
04:25:52.429 --> 04:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
display of existing Flags so hopefully
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
this latest wording will address those
 
04:25:58.189 --> 04:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
concerns uh my position is obviously one
 
04:26:00.429 --> 04:26:00.439 align:start position:0%
of support for the flag and for the
 
04:26:03.469 --> 04:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
goldar families who seek to have it
 
04:26:06.429 --> 04:26:06.439 align:start position:0%
recognized here and some of I'm sure
 
04:26:07.990 --> 04:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
will testify
 
04:26:10.670 --> 04:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
momentarily uh and some of you know uh
 
04:26:12.950 --> 04:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
I'm a a big history guy and this type of
 
04:26:16.389 --> 04:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
initiative helps to keep memories and
 
04:26:19.990 --> 04:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
Spirits alive of of our fallen uh well
 
04:26:21.830 --> 04:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
also shining some light on on some
 
04:26:23.910 --> 04:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
history you know how did we lose them
 
04:26:25.510 --> 04:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
where did we lose them why did we lose
 
04:26:28.830 --> 04:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
them so I think there's a lot of value
 
04:26:31.870 --> 04:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
to the uh flag because of the the
 
04:26:33.950 --> 04:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
history piece of it that's that's uh
 
04:26:36.830 --> 04:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
that's me uh and along those lines L um
 
04:26:38.189 --> 04:26:38.199 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be traveling to Camp
 
04:26:40.830 --> 04:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
Pendleton California in March for the
 
04:26:43.229 --> 04:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
dedication of a memorial at Camp
 
04:26:46.469 --> 04:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
Pendleton Marine base um honoring and
 
04:26:50.189 --> 04:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
remembering 20 29 29 Marines from my
 
04:26:53.189 --> 04:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
company Lima 35 who were killed in 1984
 
04:26:56.149 --> 04:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
40 years ago when the helicopter behind
 
04:27:00.510 --> 04:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
mine hit a Mountaintop in Korea so the
 
04:27:04.550 --> 04:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
the idea of of honoring and remembering
 
04:27:06.790 --> 04:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
people um
 
04:27:08.750 --> 04:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
resonates and and not just veterans I
 
04:27:10.429 --> 04:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
think we want to honor and remember all
 
04:27:14.189 --> 04:27:14.199 align:start position:0%
of our family and friends who we lose
 
04:27:16.870 --> 04:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
and in different ways and in this case
 
04:27:19.229 --> 04:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
uh people who've we've lost who wearing
 
04:27:20.309 --> 04:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
their country's
 
04:27:24.349 --> 04:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
uniform uh I think particularly deserves
 
04:27:26.309 --> 04:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
consideration especially during a time
 
04:27:28.309 --> 04:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
when military recruiting is at a
 
04:27:28.319 --> 04:27:29.429 align:start position:0%
when military recruiting is at a
historic

04:27:29.429 --> 04:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
historic
 
04:27:33.710 --> 04:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
law uh this type of
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
recognition uh serves to help I think it
 
04:27:38.710 --> 04:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
sends an important message that military
 
04:27:42.510 --> 04:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
service is still valued and that those
 
04:27:45.550 --> 04:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
who make the ultimate sacrifice will not
 
04:27:45.560 --> 04:27:47.149 align:start position:0%
who make the ultimate sacrifice will not
be

04:27:47.149 --> 04:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:27:49.510 --> 04:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
forgotten uh so this committee now owns
 
04:27:51.349 --> 04:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
this measure and obviously can further
 
04:27:55.189 --> 04:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
amend as desired um I will pass on uh
 
04:27:57.630 --> 04:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
Dan curn of honor and remember New
 
04:28:00.469 --> 04:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
England sent an email to vetan committee
 
04:28:03.149 --> 04:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
Vice chair skip Rollins um yesterday
 
04:28:05.349 --> 04:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
skip representative Rollins sent it to
 
04:28:05.359 --> 04:28:06.349 align:start position:0%
skip representative Rollins sent it to
me

04:28:06.349 --> 04:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:28:07.990 --> 04:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh pointing out that this measure
 
04:28:10.189 --> 04:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
specifically if you look at the wording
 
04:28:12.990 --> 04:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
it specifically mentions National Gold
 
04:28:16.790 --> 04:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
Star Mothers Day I believe that's in
 
04:28:18.830 --> 04:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
September uh now the committee could
 
04:28:22.269 --> 04:28:22.279 align:start position:0%
change that according to uh Dan Colin
 
04:28:23.910 --> 04:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
you could change it to Gold Star
 
04:28:27.149 --> 04:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
family's day as opposed to Gold Star
 
04:28:30.309 --> 04:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
Mother's Day because um they're both the
 
04:28:32.670 --> 04:28:32.680 align:start position:0%
same day mothers or families that that
 
04:28:35.269 --> 04:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
type of thing that wording you can
 
04:28:37.710 --> 04:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
consider if you'd like uh speaking of
 
04:28:39.269 --> 04:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
Representative Rollins he was hoping to
 
04:28:43.550 --> 04:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
be here today but he could not uh he U
 
04:28:46.590 --> 04:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
had to stay at work as some of you know
 
04:28:49.910 --> 04:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative Rollins is a gold star
 
04:28:52.670 --> 04:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
father uh his son having been killed in
 
04:28:57.309 --> 04:28:57.319 align:start position:0%
the Middle East um around 20 years ago
 
04:28:58.950 --> 04:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
he did send me a brief message which I
 
04:29:01.269 --> 04:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
will read before I conclude here and
 
04:29:03.389 --> 04:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
this is from representative
 
04:29:05.790 --> 04:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
Rollins he's the vice chair of State
 
04:29:07.469 --> 04:29:07.479 align:start position:0%
Federal and Veterans my with the
 
04:29:09.830 --> 04:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
committee I chair he's my vice
 
04:29:13.070 --> 04:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
chair uh from represent Rollins I won't
 
04:29:15.750 --> 04:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
be able to make it as we are short
 
04:29:18.550 --> 04:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
staffed at work this bill has been a
 
04:29:21.189 --> 04:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
long time in the making the first couple
 
04:29:22.750 --> 04:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
of times it was
 
04:29:25.269 --> 04:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
introduced it had too many days in which
 
04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
they wanted to fly the flag now it's
 
04:29:31.469 --> 04:29:31.479 align:start position:0%
been modified to fly only on veteran
 
04:29:31.479 --> 04:29:32.750 align:start position:0%
been modified to fly only on veteran
related

04:29:32.750 --> 04:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
related
 
04:29:35.389 --> 04:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
holidays I feel this bill has a really
 
04:29:38.269 --> 04:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
good chance to pass this time if we get
 
04:29:40.309 --> 04:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
it out of the house I know the Senate
 
04:29:43.070 --> 04:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
and Governor will support it I thought
 
04:29:44.550 --> 04:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
it would come through our veterans
 
04:29:46.910 --> 04:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
committee if it had I was going to ask
 
04:29:50.750 --> 04:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
to do the pi I personally know a lot of
 
04:29:53.910 --> 04:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
Goldstar families they would really love
 
04:29:56.550 --> 04:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
to see this pass the biggest fear for
 
04:29:58.750 --> 04:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
Goldstar families is that Sons and
 
04:30:00.269 --> 04:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
Daughters will be
 
04:30:02.510 --> 04:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
forgotten so this bill will go a long
 
04:30:05.030 --> 04:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
ways to helping them know their losses
 
04:30:06.149 --> 04:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
won't be
 
04:30:08.070 --> 04:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
forgotten Skipper
 
04:30:10.630 --> 04:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
enss so passing it on from Skip and by
 
04:30:12.070 --> 04:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
the way for those of those of you
 
04:30:16.109 --> 04:30:16.119 align:start position:0%
watching at home uh Pi Pi means
 
04:30:16.119 --> 04:30:17.510 align:start position:0%
watching at home uh Pi Pi means
parliamentary

04:30:17.510 --> 04:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
parliamentary
 
04:30:20.349 --> 04:30:20.359 align:start position:0%
inquiry uh which is offered just before
 
04:30:23.830 --> 04:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
house floor vote which helps to uh more
 
04:30:26.590 --> 04:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
clearly summarize and explain the intent
 
04:30:28.510 --> 04:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
of a measure just before the house votes
 
04:30:31.550 --> 04:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
on it as we all know but uh not
 
04:30:34.109 --> 04:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
everybody maybe knows what a pi is but
 
04:30:37.070 --> 04:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh skip would have wanted or represent
 
04:30:38.750 --> 04:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
Rollins would have wanted to have done
 
04:30:41.349 --> 04:30:41.359 align:start position:0%
the pi as a gold star father so that's
 
04:30:43.349 --> 04:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
all I have thank you for your time and
 
04:30:45.030 --> 04:30:45.040 align:start position:0%

don't mean to take over your committee
 
04:31:35.990 --> 04:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
but if people let watch watching on
 
04:31:39.309 --> 04:31:39.319 align:start position:0%
YouTube might want to see the flag UHA
 
04:31:39.319 --> 04:31:43.070 align:start position:0%
YouTube might want to see the flag UHA
to

04:31:43.070 --> 04:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:51.229 --> 04:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
that hold well there for better worse
 
04:31:52.830 --> 04:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
there there it
 
04:31:56.429 --> 04:31:56.439 align:start position:0%
is okay um to answer Upson W's question
 
04:31:59.229 --> 04:31:59.239 align:start position:0%

you um you can take it down now thank
 
04:32:06.030 --> 04:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
you you can carry it a couple of
 
04:32:08.670 --> 04:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
questions represent M sure just a couple
 
04:32:11.790 --> 04:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
quick ones um where else in the country
 
04:32:13.830 --> 04:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
has this flag been flown do you know
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
what other states question is uh where
 
04:32:19.149 --> 04:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
has this flag been flown or approved
 
04:32:22.990 --> 04:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
elsewhere uh I know it's it's a national
 
04:32:25.590 --> 04:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh incorporation that does this and I'm
 
04:32:27.910 --> 04:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
going to defer I I I think there's at
 
04:32:31.109 --> 04:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
least hopefully I see some pink cards so
 
04:32:32.229 --> 04:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
some of the folks that are going to come
 
04:32:34.990 --> 04:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
up that are uh part of the movement
 
04:32:37.469 --> 04:32:37.479 align:start position:0%
could could answer that better than me
 
04:32:39.309 --> 04:32:39.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and final question
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
if I may please thank you um I know when
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
we had the PW flag legislation and such
 
04:32:47.510 --> 04:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh there was a lot of question and
 
04:32:49.469 --> 04:32:49.479 align:start position:0%
concern about when it would be flown
 
04:32:51.830 --> 04:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
where it would be on the mask and such
 
04:32:53.630 --> 04:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
um it will be of course below the
 
04:32:57.750 --> 04:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
American flag how will you display this
 
04:33:00.870 --> 04:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question uh in
 
04:33:04.551 --> 04:33:04.561 align:start position:0%
the uh legislation I think it
 
04:33:07.670 --> 04:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
specifically says this would be the uh
 
04:33:07.680 --> 04:33:08.629 align:start position:0%
specifically says this would be the uh
the

04:33:08.629 --> 04:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:33:12.551 --> 04:33:12.561 align:start position:0%
last in terms of sequence uh American
 
04:33:14.470 --> 04:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
flag and other flags P flag this one
 
04:33:17.629 --> 04:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
would be the last one uh in terms of
 
04:33:21.070 --> 04:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:23.629 --> 04:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
flown um may I have a final final
 
04:33:28.310 --> 04:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
question please um my only wonder is you
 
04:33:30.590 --> 04:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
know not all of us I have a flag pole at
 
04:33:33.949 --> 04:33:33.959 align:start position:0%
home and I have a couple flags on it
 
04:33:35.470 --> 04:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
with the order on which this will will
 
04:33:39.230 --> 04:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
be flown um is it going to be awkward on
 
04:33:41.029 --> 04:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
and I don't mean to offend anybody
 
04:33:45.150 --> 04:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
because it's a beautiful flag is how is
 
04:33:48.310 --> 04:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
this going to be adopted by people with
 
04:33:51.470 --> 04:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
out llarge flag poles and the fact that
 
04:33:53.910 --> 04:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
it will be displayed daily and you have
 
04:33:56.029 --> 04:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
the American flag you have the P flag
 
04:33:59.150 --> 04:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
you have this how explain that please
 
04:34:00.670 --> 04:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question it's a
 
04:34:02.590 --> 04:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
great question my understanding is that
 
04:34:05.910 --> 04:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
that concern has been what has this from
 
04:34:09.390 --> 04:34:09.400 align:start position:0%
moving forward in the past
 
04:34:13.629 --> 04:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
uh it's as I read the the legislation
 
04:34:15.470 --> 04:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm the prime sponsor as I read the
 
04:34:19.709 --> 04:34:19.719 align:start position:0%
wording that we move forward uh daily is
 
04:34:22.990 --> 04:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
is not the issue at this time uh
 
04:34:26.310 --> 04:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
specifically the flag would be flown at
 
04:34:28.830 --> 04:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
uh the designated times in the
 
04:34:32.070 --> 04:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
legislation uh which again you could uh
 
04:34:34.029 --> 04:34:34.039 align:start position:0%
you could change that you could uh
 
04:34:38.109 --> 04:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
further uh Define or or limit or expand
 
04:34:41.429 --> 04:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
or limit the times that it would be
 
04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
officially uh flown be you know spec I
 
04:34:47.510 --> 04:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
already mentioned uh Goldstar Mother's
 
04:34:49.349 --> 04:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
Day or Goldstar family's day in
 
04:34:52.629 --> 04:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
September that that's in the the wording
 
04:35:01.429 --> 04:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:04.830 --> 04:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
it I just have a one question for you um
 
04:35:07.150 --> 04:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
in doing some research on this bill um I
 
04:35:11.189 --> 04:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
saw that it has gone uh before the US
 
04:35:14.349 --> 04:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
House and Senate um and it hasn't picked
 
04:35:15.830 --> 04:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
up a whole lot of
 
04:35:20.310 --> 04:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
support and um I'm wondering if you know
 
04:35:24.551 --> 04:35:24.561 align:start position:0%
why sure uh again the question being why
 
04:35:26.189 --> 04:35:26.199 align:start position:0%
there has been concerns that this hasn't
 
04:35:28.429 --> 04:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
moved forward is as so many people would
 
04:35:31.150 --> 04:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
like you to and um I'll let others speak
 
04:35:33.390 --> 04:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
to that as well as I said before I'm
 
04:35:36.590 --> 04:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
sure that the concerns are largely
 
04:35:40.949 --> 04:35:40.959 align:start position:0%
related to other flags um and this type
 
04:35:44.230 --> 04:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
of thing we need to be careful in a in
 
04:35:45.990 --> 04:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
sanctioning or giving official
 
04:35:48.750 --> 04:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
recognition to any flag or symbol
 
04:35:53.150 --> 04:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
because uh it it does set preceden and
 
04:35:56.070 --> 04:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
and there are other Flags uh gosh if you
 
04:35:59.750 --> 04:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
go to any parade um there were flags for
 
04:36:02.670 --> 04:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
everything and not all of them can fly
 
04:36:04.470 --> 04:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
in the state house I know the Marine
 
04:36:07.390 --> 04:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
Corps flag FES once a year I'm um in the
 
04:36:08.869 --> 04:36:08.879 align:start position:0%
Marine Corps those of you watching at
 
04:36:13.230 --> 04:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
home uh Ry so November 10th uh once a
 
04:36:15.750 --> 04:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
year the marine flag flies but uh to
 
04:36:18.670 --> 04:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
your point or your question uh I'm sure
 
04:36:22.709 --> 04:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
that cons there are only so many uh days
 
04:36:24.830 --> 04:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
and there's only so much room for flags
 
04:36:27.070 --> 04:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
and so that's part of the issue and the
 
04:36:28.869 --> 04:36:28.879 align:start position:0%
precedent issue and I and I'm sure
 
04:36:31.109 --> 04:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
others uh some of these good folks have
 
04:36:33.349 --> 04:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
been working this for years and years
 
04:36:36.390 --> 04:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
and they uh could speak to some of the
 
04:36:39.029 --> 04:36:39.039 align:start position:0%
history and questions better than me I'm
 
04:36:43.029 --> 04:36:43.039 align:start position:0%
sure thank you is there any other
 
04:36:48.750 --> 04:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:59.709 --> 04:36:59.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:01.949 --> 04:37:01.959 align:start position:0%
Perry good afternoon Madam chair members
 
04:37:03.230 --> 04:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
04:37:04.709 --> 04:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
is Warren Perry I'm the deputy Adent
 
04:37:05.990 --> 04:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
General for New Hampshire's Department
 
04:37:08.349 --> 04:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
of military Affairs and veteran services
 
04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
we are the department in the state that
 
04:37:12.070 --> 04:37:12.080 align:start position:0%

04:37:14.269 --> 04:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Veteran Cemetery in
 
04:37:16.789 --> 04:37:16.799 align:start position:0%
bosin we do support the bill as a
 
04:37:21.029 --> 04:37:21.039 align:start position:0%
department uh I think no harm can come
 
04:37:22.750 --> 04:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
only good can come of supporting the
 
04:37:25.789 --> 04:37:25.799 align:start position:0%
bill so uh you know there are concerns
 
04:37:27.670 --> 04:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
about how many flags we fly how many
 
04:37:29.230 --> 04:37:29.240 align:start position:0%
precedents we set some veterans will
 
04:37:31.789 --> 04:37:31.799 align:start position:0%
tell you that we have a flag that honors
 
04:37:34.150 --> 04:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh our fallen the American flag you know
 
04:37:35.830 --> 04:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
and and our fallen our their coffins are
 
04:37:37.349 --> 04:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
draped with it it's presented to family
 
04:37:39.429 --> 04:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
members as we go but this particular
 
04:37:43.789 --> 04:37:43.799 align:start position:0%
symbol will go a long way in helping uh
 
04:37:45.709 --> 04:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
honor the memory of those who have
 
04:37:48.310 --> 04:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
fallen so we I would just offer that
 
04:37:51.109 --> 04:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
that's our support for this particular
 
04:37:54.390 --> 04:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh for this particular Bill uh I think
 
04:37:56.910 --> 04:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't know exactly but I think
 
04:37:59.590 --> 04:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
there are about a thousand gold star
 
04:38:00.750 --> 04:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
family members in the state of New
 
04:38:02.629 --> 04:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one way or the other that are
 
04:38:04.269 --> 04:38:04.279 align:start position:0%
considered Gold Star Family sometimes
 
04:38:07.750 --> 04:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
the definition can be uh you know were
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
they actually killed in combat did they
 
04:38:11.910 --> 04:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
die in training did were they did they
 
04:38:13.910 --> 04:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
die in the theater of combat operations
 
04:38:15.789 --> 04:38:15.799 align:start position:0%
not related to combat operations none of
 
04:38:17.910 --> 04:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
that matters to the family the family
 
04:38:19.910 --> 04:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
just knows that there is a loss and the
 
04:38:21.709 --> 04:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
loss is a result of some military
 
04:38:24.390 --> 04:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
service and and you know when we when we
 
04:38:26.629 --> 04:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
do things at the cemetery when we have
 
04:38:29.429 --> 04:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
events at the cemetery replace WS or
 
04:38:31.390 --> 04:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
flags on the graves of those that are
 
04:38:33.789 --> 04:38:33.799 align:start position:0%
there we always ask the people that are
 
04:38:35.869 --> 04:38:35.879 align:start position:0%
participating to read the names on the
 
04:38:39.310 --> 04:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
on the uh on the on the markers because
 
04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
a name mentioned or said aloud is never
 
04:38:45.269 --> 04:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
forgot this flag is another way to
 
04:38:47.629 --> 04:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
continue to honor that memory I will
 
04:38:50.150 --> 04:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
tell you that without the legislation
 
04:38:52.029 --> 04:38:52.039 align:start position:0%
the state Veteran Cemetery in bosin
 
04:38:54.150 --> 04:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
flies the flag there's already a flag
 
04:38:56.070 --> 04:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
pole in a mast in our Memorial walkway
 
04:38:58.029 --> 04:38:58.039 align:start position:0%
that the flag has flown daily there and
 
04:39:00.349 --> 04:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
we will continue to do so regardless of
 
04:39:02.830 --> 04:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
the status of this uh you know the the
 
04:39:05.949 --> 04:39:05.959 align:start position:0%
fate of this bill if you will so pending
 
04:39:07.551 --> 04:39:07.561 align:start position:0%

any questions from the
committee

04:39:18.310 --> 04:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:39:21.429 --> 04:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
runi thank you for taking my question
 
04:39:23.551 --> 04:39:23.561 align:start position:0%
question I've got for you is the flag
 
04:39:25.830 --> 04:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
that they showed us that was for a
 
04:39:28.470 --> 04:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
particular individual yes okay the flag
 
04:39:31.109 --> 04:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
you fly at bosin is there a name on the
 
04:39:33.429 --> 04:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
bottom or there no name on the there is
 
04:39:35.230 --> 04:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
no name on the bottom of that on the
 
04:39:38.150 --> 04:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
flag that we have at our Cemetery okay
 
04:39:40.390 --> 04:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and I would I would just add
 
04:39:43.590 --> 04:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
just to to say that there everyone in
 
04:39:47.070 --> 04:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
that Cemetery regardless of their rank
 
04:39:49.310 --> 04:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
how they died their service is honored
 
04:39:51.230 --> 04:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
equally so you know the cemetery
 
04:39:53.868 --> 04:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
director very aptly puts you know when
 
04:39:55.270 --> 04:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
he's asked who are some of the special
 
04:39:56.948 --> 04:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
people buried here and he will say there
 
04:40:00.390 --> 04:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
are 16,000 special people buried here so
 
04:40:02.070 --> 04:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
we don't single people out there just as
 
04:40:05.350 --> 04:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
a matter of course sir R Pearson
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
than you madam chair I'm just uh Curious
 
04:40:08.830 --> 04:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
on the duration of how long you've been
 
04:40:10.150 --> 04:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
flying that in
 
04:40:14.550 --> 04:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
bosin rough roughly it's more than years
 
04:40:16.510 --> 04:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
so you know that the cemetery is 25
 
04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
years old I know that we've uh so the
 
04:40:21.470 --> 04:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
current it was flown before the current
 
04:40:24.350 --> 04:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
director he's been there for about four
 
04:40:28.310 --> 04:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
years so I think at least at least six
 
04:40:31.310 --> 04:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:33.350 --> 04:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
longer it's been
 
04:40:36.070 --> 04:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
that are there any other questions I I
 
04:40:37.868 --> 04:40:37.878 align:start position:0%
don't know the exact I caution you just
 
04:40:39.310 --> 04:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
caveat that I don't know the exact date
 
04:40:40.830 --> 04:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
but it we didn't just start flying it
 
04:40:43.830 --> 04:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
when the bill popped up yeah no close
 
04:40:46.030 --> 04:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
enough seeing no more questions thank
 
04:40:55.110 --> 04:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:59.270 --> 04:40:59.280 align:start position:0%

representing the state veterans advisory
 
04:41:26.110 --> 04:41:26.120 align:start position:0%
committee and as I don't see this
 
04:41:27.868 --> 04:41:27.878 align:start position:0%
committee very often and I I see a lot
 
04:41:29.590 --> 04:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
of unfamiliar faes I'd like to take a
 
04:41:31.470 --> 04:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
just a a few seconds to say what it is
 
04:41:35.110 --> 04:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
we do we're chartered by state organiz a
 
04:41:38.150 --> 04:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
state law to uh put together a a
 
04:41:40.270 --> 04:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
committee which has 20 members on it and
 
04:41:42.070 --> 04:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
these members would be familiar to you
 
04:41:45.230 --> 04:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
names like the BFW the American Legion
 
04:41:47.190 --> 04:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
all of the services are represented as
 
04:41:48.628 --> 04:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
well I represent the air and space
 
04:41:51.230 --> 04:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
forces Association on this committee one
 
04:41:53.750 --> 04:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the things we do is we look at all
 
04:41:55.670 --> 04:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
the bills that are coming before the
 
04:41:59.430 --> 04:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
legislature and we signal out the ones
 
04:42:00.868 --> 04:42:00.878 align:start position:0%
that we think have better impact and
 
04:42:03.270 --> 04:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
then I come as the legislative chair and
 
04:42:05.910 --> 04:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
I tell you what we've excited about that
 
04:42:09.110 --> 04:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
particular bill so with that all in mind
 
04:42:12.070 --> 04:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
I am the Messenger okay about what I'm
 
04:42:16.230 --> 04:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
about to tell you um art we have opposed
 
04:42:17.750 --> 04:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
this bill since the first one came out
 
04:42:20.948 --> 04:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
in 2018 we opposed it in 2018 we oppos
 
04:42:22.708 --> 04:42:22.718 align:start position:0%
it again in in
 
04:42:25.990 --> 04:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
2020 and our principal argument from our
 
04:42:29.190 --> 04:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
members has always been that the the
 
04:42:31.990 --> 04:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
symbol that that that we want on our
 
04:42:34.628 --> 04:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
coffins the symbol that talks about our
 
04:42:37.910 --> 04:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
Services is the American flag uh the
 
04:42:40.110 --> 04:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
honor and remember folks I don't really
 
04:42:42.230 --> 04:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
have anything against them although you
 
04:42:45.070 --> 04:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
know I I do take exception maybe a
 
04:42:46.910 --> 04:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
little bit in paragraph two where it
 
04:42:48.788 --> 04:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
says they're a National Organization
 
04:42:51.070 --> 04:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
these folks are a commercial concern
 
04:42:54.110 --> 04:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
they make money off of these flags so
 
04:42:55.788 --> 04:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
while they may have good intentions and
 
04:42:58.310 --> 04:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
I I we we know that they do somebody
 
04:43:00.948 --> 04:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
makes money for that Corporation off of
 
04:43:02.750 --> 04:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
this and it's not like a National
 
04:43:05.510 --> 04:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
Organization like you know like the like
 
04:43:07.948 --> 04:43:07.958 align:start position:0%
the VFW or the American Legion it's it's
 
04:43:10.270 --> 04:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
a it's a commercial uh
 
04:43:13.830 --> 04:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
concern and so when you have a bill like
 
04:43:17.070 --> 04:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
this that that b basically mandates that
 
04:43:18.948 --> 04:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
we're going to and we already have one
 
04:43:20.430 --> 04:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
for the for the veteran cator they're
 
04:43:21.110 --> 04:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
good there we're going to have to
 
04:43:22.910 --> 04:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
procure one for the State House
 
04:43:25.030 --> 04:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
according to this bill uh to grow up
 
04:43:27.190 --> 04:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
there and so somebody's going to
 
04:43:30.708 --> 04:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
essentially Soul Source award this kind
 
04:43:32.910 --> 04:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
of government contract Small Potatoes
 
04:43:34.830 --> 04:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
though it may be you know they're
 
04:43:37.310 --> 04:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
they're giving that this to these folks
 
04:43:39.708 --> 04:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
so that that has been some of the
 
04:43:41.390 --> 04:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
argument some of our some of our
 
04:43:43.470 --> 04:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
positions have softened over time
 
04:43:45.948 --> 04:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and I asked them twice
 
04:43:48.110 --> 04:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
they said this is not one of those ones
 
04:43:50.910 --> 04:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
that we that that we're ready to sop it
 
04:43:53.590 --> 04:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
our position on now like like Colonel
 
04:43:57.628 --> 04:43:57.638 align:start position:0%
Perry said if this bill goes forward
 
04:43:58.708 --> 04:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
life goes
 
04:44:01.390 --> 04:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
on we'll all we'll all you know salute
 
04:44:03.150 --> 04:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
smartly and move on we're all military
 
04:44:05.948 --> 04:44:05.958 align:start position:0%
folks that's concludes by testimony
 
04:44:07.788 --> 04:44:07.798 align:start position:0%
unless anybody has any questions for me
 
04:44:10.070 --> 04:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
about why we came to the conclusions

04:52:26.190 --> 04:52:26.200 align:start position:0%
not familiar with it it's 501c3 we have
 
04:52:28.628 --> 04:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
partnered with the state recently on the
 
04:52:30.750 --> 04:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
Gopher um and working with the state and
 
04:52:32.310 --> 04:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
actually processing those grants for
 
04:52:35.470 --> 04:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
veteran organizations We have basically
 
04:52:38.270 --> 04:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
as an organization helped fund those
 
04:52:42.070 --> 04:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
veteran services that are in need um and
 
04:52:43.868 --> 04:52:43.878 align:start position:0%
in our state there there's a great need
 
04:52:46.350 --> 04:52:46.360 align:start position:0%
to it as a population we actually have a
 
04:52:48.990 --> 04:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
higher population per capita than most
 
04:52:51.548 --> 04:52:51.558 align:start position:0%
states of veteran services uh we take a
 
04:52:53.750 --> 04:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
lot of pride in that this in the state
 
04:52:56.110 --> 04:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
and we have worked very hard to become
 
04:52:58.510 --> 04:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
one of the most veteran friendly states
 
04:53:00.670 --> 04:53:00.680 align:start position:0%
in the country most recently with
 
04:53:03.030 --> 04:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
Franklin and and working on that Center
 
04:53:06.030 --> 04:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
which is going to be be a um a huge win
 
04:53:07.948 --> 04:53:07.958 align:start position:0%
for our state in attracting military
 
04:53:11.070 --> 04:53:11.080 align:start position:0%
families which I think provides great
 
04:53:13.350 --> 04:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
Services um they're great workers
 
04:53:14.948 --> 04:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
they're great families great
 
04:53:17.110 --> 04:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
constituents for our state and we want
 
04:53:19.430 --> 04:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
to continue to be veteran friendly but
 
04:53:21.390 --> 04:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
there's nothing I could say we could do
 
04:53:23.910 --> 04:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
more than honoring the gold star
 
04:53:26.430 --> 04:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
families you know for veterans who have
 
04:53:28.670 --> 04:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
passed you know they've gone gone on and
 
04:53:30.868 --> 04:53:30.878 align:start position:0%
they paid the ultimate sacrifice but
 
04:53:33.310 --> 04:53:33.320 align:start position:0%
these families live on and they have
 
04:53:35.548 --> 04:53:35.558 align:start position:0%
that pain and suffering on a daily basis
 
04:53:38.070 --> 04:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
they come to our events we carry every
 
04:53:40.470 --> 04:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
one of our events we have a memory wall
 
04:53:42.150 --> 04:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
that has a name of each one of our
 
04:53:44.030 --> 04:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
following for the State of New Hampshire
 
04:53:46.110 --> 04:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
and these families come out to be able
 
04:53:48.590 --> 04:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
to see those names and remember their
 
04:53:51.110 --> 04:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
individual their their child their
 
04:53:54.510 --> 04:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
brother their sister and it gives them a
 
04:53:57.350 --> 04:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
sense of purpose and I got to tell you
 
04:53:59.670 --> 04:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's a great right now as they had
 
04:54:01.948 --> 04:54:01.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier a recruiting with it
 
04:54:04.070 --> 04:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
being down with military service
 
04:54:05.430 --> 04:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
I can't think of a better thing we could
 
04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
do here at the state than to honor those
 
04:54:10.548 --> 04:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
that have fallen because folks you know
 
04:54:12.670 --> 04:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
you commend you because You' have
 
04:54:15.030 --> 04:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
decided to serve the state and you serve
 
04:54:18.230 --> 04:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
it willingly but freedom is not
 
04:54:20.868 --> 04:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
free so I would appreciate yall support

you thank you very much for having me
 
04:54:47.910 --> 04:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
today um I'd like to start by giving you
 
04:54:51.910 --> 04:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
a little background on my interactions
 
04:54:53.990 --> 04:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
with Goldstar family members I'm a
 
04:54:58.230 --> 04:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
military spouse of 40 plus years when um
 
04:55:01.310 --> 04:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
our recent conflicts have happened my
 
04:55:03.910 --> 04:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
husband was the New Hampshire Army
 
04:55:06.548 --> 04:55:06.558 align:start position:0%
National Guard Chief of Staff so a lot
 
04:55:08.788 --> 04:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
of times when we had losses in this
 
04:55:12.628 --> 04:55:12.638 align:start position:0%
state um our faces were oftentimes the
 
04:55:15.788 --> 04:55:15.798 align:start position:0%
first that family members saw we have
 
04:55:17.948 --> 04:55:17.958 align:start position:0%
continued those relationships some going
 
04:55:22.470 --> 04:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
on 20 years um and one of the things
 
04:55:24.670 --> 04:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
that we have seen that brings Comfort to
 
04:55:28.030 --> 04:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
our families is this flag my husband is
 
04:55:29.868 --> 04:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
a West Point graduate
 
04:55:33.868 --> 04:55:33.878 align:start position:0%
79 um a true patriot and flag etiquette
 
04:55:37.470 --> 04:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
to him um he sees sometimes what has
 
04:55:40.070 --> 04:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
been done to our flag and it often
 
04:55:42.390 --> 04:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
brings HIM Tears so when I first
 
04:55:44.350 --> 04:55:44.360 align:start position:0%
approached him with this honor and
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
remember flag he was like many others um
 
04:55:51.310 --> 04:55:51.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely against it because we do have
 
04:55:54.030 --> 04:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
an American flag and what that
 
04:55:56.868 --> 04:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
symbolizes um is extremely important for
 
04:55:59.310 --> 04:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
him he fought for that in combat in
 
04:56:02.470 --> 04:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan um came home with um both
 
04:56:04.628 --> 04:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
physical and and
 
04:56:08.830 --> 04:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
um and non-physical wounds of war and
 
04:56:11.830 --> 04:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
when we've talked about this he is in
 
04:56:14.070 --> 04:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
full support of this flag because he
 
04:56:16.830 --> 04:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
again has seen what it's done for our
 
04:56:20.310 --> 04:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
family he again has taken a step back
 
04:56:22.190 --> 04:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
and really looked into what we're asking
 
04:56:26.070 --> 04:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
for um there are 27 states in the
 
04:56:28.350 --> 04:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
country that have adopted this flag it
 
04:56:30.510 --> 04:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
is clearly stated on any of their
 
04:56:32.270 --> 04:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
material that they put out it will
 
04:56:34.430 --> 04:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
always be sub subservient to any other
 
04:56:37.190 --> 04:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
flag that you would fly to include the P
 
04:56:40.750 --> 04:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
Mia flag to include any other flags
 
04:56:43.350 --> 04:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
often times it's actually flown separate
 
04:56:45.510 --> 04:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
on a different flag pole because it does
 
04:56:48.548 --> 04:56:48.558 align:start position:0%
get messy right and as visual people we
 
04:56:51.590 --> 04:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
just don't want stacking of so what
 
04:56:53.948 --> 04:56:53.958 align:start position:0%
we're asking now is for five I think
 
04:56:56.910 --> 04:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
it's five specific days
 
04:56:59.470 --> 04:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
and often times again we've been doing
 
04:57:02.548 --> 04:57:02.558 align:start position:0%
this for over two decades there's such
 
04:57:05.948 --> 04:57:05.958 align:start position:0%
an outpour ing of Community Support when
 
04:57:05.958 --> 04:57:06.830 align:start position:0%
an outpour ing of Community Support when
we

04:57:06.830 --> 04:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:57:10.670 --> 04:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
lose um a military service member in any
 
04:57:14.310 --> 04:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
way we lower the flags there are hours
 
04:57:16.750 --> 04:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
and hours of waights when we attend
 
04:57:19.510 --> 04:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
funerals there are lines of processions
 
04:57:22.868 --> 04:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
and guess what most of that goes away
 
04:57:25.030 --> 04:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
and the only thing that we hear from our
 
04:57:27.070 --> 04:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
families is that their children their
 
04:57:29.990 --> 04:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
loved ones their spouses are remembered
 
04:57:33.390 --> 04:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
and this is just I feel a very small ask
 
04:57:36.670 --> 04:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
for them to be able to be considered so
 
04:57:39.070 --> 04:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
that the education can go out in
 
04:57:41.788 --> 04:57:41.798 align:start position:0%
communities because when you see the
 
04:57:43.788 --> 04:57:43.798 align:start position:0%
American flag everybody's thinking you
 
04:57:45.948 --> 04:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
know again it's a symbol for all of us
 
04:57:47.390 --> 04:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
but if you were to walk down your
 
04:57:50.070 --> 04:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
neighborhood and see this beautiful flag
 
04:57:52.390 --> 04:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
flying you might stop and if somebody's
 
04:57:54.750 --> 04:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
out gardening ask them about it right
 
04:57:56.470 --> 04:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
and they get to tell that story of their
 
04:58:01.070 --> 04:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
loved on so um I I really implore that
 
04:58:02.708 --> 04:58:02.718 align:start position:0%
you take the time and really look at
 
04:58:04.230 --> 04:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
there's a way website that explains it
 
04:58:08.310 --> 04:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
all um 27 States always subservient to
 
04:58:09.948 --> 04:58:09.958 align:start position:0%
other stuff so there there had been for
 
04:58:11.868 --> 04:58:11.878 align:start position:0%
many years and we have we're not giving
 
04:58:16.510 --> 04:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
this we're not giving up um so we have
 
04:58:20.430 --> 04:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
just you know kind of let people come up
 
04:58:23.190 --> 04:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
with their own ideas of what it what the
 
04:58:25.190 --> 04:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
purpose is and the purpose really is to
 
04:58:27.390 --> 04:58:27.400 align:start position:0%
give back to those families who have
 
04:58:29.670 --> 04:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
given that ultimate
 
04:58:31.548 --> 04:58:31.558 align:start position:0%
sacrifice thank you very much for your
 
04:58:34.030 --> 04:58:34.040 align:start position:0%
testimony will you take questions yep
 
04:58:35.390 --> 04:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
04:58:38.150 --> 04:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative wall thank you
 
04:58:40.350 --> 04:58:40.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for telling us that 27 states
 
04:58:42.390 --> 04:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
have adopted this I I've been wondering
 
04:58:46.270 --> 04:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
that um do they those States uh have the
 
04:58:48.590 --> 04:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
same requirements that this bill is
 
04:58:50.390 --> 04:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
asking no it it's a different
 
04:58:53.110 --> 04:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
legislation some of them fly it at all
 
04:58:56.070 --> 04:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
times you know so it's different per per
 
04:58:58.190 --> 04:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
state and good enough thank you so much
 
04:58:58.200 --> 04:58:59.990 align:start position:0%
state and good enough thank you so much

04:59:15.230 --> 04:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
groto welcome to legislative
 
04:59:17.788 --> 04:59:17.798 align:start position:0%
Administration thank you so much I'm
 
04:59:19.548 --> 04:59:19.558 align:start position:0%
representative Jackie Gro I'm here
 
04:59:21.990 --> 04:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
representing Rockingham 24 which are the
 
04:59:23.510 --> 04:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
towns of Ry and
 
04:59:26.390 --> 04:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
Greenland Blake Maron whose name is on
 
04:59:28.910 --> 04:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
that flag would have been one of my
 
04:59:31.270 --> 04:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
constituents because his mother is a
 
04:59:34.670 --> 04:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
constituent of mine and she brought this
 
04:59:36.708 --> 04:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
bill this idea to my attention and
 
04:59:39.190 --> 04:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
that's why I co-sponsored the
 
04:59:43.230 --> 04:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
bill we have in above our Capital an
 
04:59:45.070 --> 04:59:45.080 align:start position:0%
American flag and underneath that
 
04:59:49.910 --> 04:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
American flag is a p Mia flag and that
 
04:59:53.430 --> 04:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
flag flies daily to remind us all of
 
04:59:56.310 --> 04:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
those that are missing in action or
 
04:59:57.470 --> 04:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
prisoners of
 
05:00:00.110 --> 05:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
war in that are in the
 
05:00:03.990 --> 05:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
military this bill is not very
 
05:00:07.990 --> 05:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
complicated it only asks that we fly the
 
05:00:11.430 --> 05:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
honor and remember flag 5 days a week
 
05:00:13.868 --> 05:00:13.878 align:start position:0%
underneath the state
 
05:00:17.230 --> 05:00:17.240 align:start position:0%
flag and if the cost of the flag is an
 
05:00:19.830 --> 05:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
issue I can assure you I'll be glad to
 
05:00:23.030 --> 05:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
provide it to the state as a
 
05:00:28.110 --> 05:00:28.120 align:start position:0%
gift the flag to me completes the
 
05:00:31.430 --> 05:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
story when someone's missing an
 
05:00:33.868 --> 05:00:33.878 align:start position:0%
action and they've been
 
05:00:36.990 --> 05:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
found that family receives a gold
 
05:00:41.230 --> 05:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
star and that to me closes the chapter
 
05:00:45.590 --> 05:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
for that family and for that person
 
05:00:49.190 --> 05:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
however those individuals live forever
 
05:00:52.390 --> 05:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
in our hearts and should be remembered
 
05:00:55.190 --> 05:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
and should be armored with this flag on
 
05:00:57.350 --> 05:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
those five days a week above the state
 
05:00:59.470 --> 05:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
capital thank
 
05:01:01.788 --> 05:01:01.798 align:start position:0%
you will you take any questions
 
05:01:03.788 --> 05:01:03.798 align:start position:0%

star parents they lost their son to
 
05:01:55.470 --> 05:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
suicide after returning from Iraq um as
 
05:01:56.948 --> 05:01:56.958 align:start position:0%
was mentioned the honor and remember
 
05:02:00.270 --> 05:02:00.280 align:start position:0%
flag does not replace any flag uh and
 
05:02:02.548 --> 05:02:02.558 align:start position:0%
that was never the intent it recognizes
 
05:02:04.628 --> 05:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
the sacrifice made on behalf of our
 
05:02:08.190 --> 05:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
country um I have various folded Flags
 
05:02:10.788 --> 05:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
in in my house uh I have one that was
 
05:02:13.270 --> 05:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
flown over the state capital here uh
 
05:02:15.750 --> 05:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
that I was given up upon my retirement I
 
05:02:18.350 --> 05:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
also have uh flags that were uh draped
 
05:02:20.628 --> 05:02:20.638 align:start position:0%
my both my parents uh coffins who both
 
05:02:23.230 --> 05:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
served in the Army unless you come into
 
05:02:24.788 --> 05:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
my house you have no idea what those
 
05:02:27.670 --> 05:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
flags represent uh you see a folded flag
 
05:02:29.230 --> 05:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
but unless I tell you specifically what
 
05:02:32.110 --> 05:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
it is for you will never know my sister
 
05:02:34.110 --> 05:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
and brother-in-law are the same way they
 
05:02:36.030 --> 05:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
have an honor and remember flag and they
 
05:02:37.548 --> 05:02:37.558 align:start position:0%
just moved into a new house and as soon
 
05:02:39.510 --> 05:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
as their flag pole is up that flag will
 
05:02:43.470 --> 05:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
will fly proudly below the US flag um
 
05:02:45.150 --> 05:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
but right now they have a folded flag
 
05:02:47.510 --> 05:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
for their son Derek in their house but
 
05:02:50.310 --> 05:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
who sees that besides them nobody knows
 
05:02:52.150 --> 05:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
of their sacrifice unless you personally
 
05:02:54.990 --> 05:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
know my sister and brother-in-law uh the
 
05:02:56.788 --> 05:02:56.798 align:start position:0%
honor and remember flag is an outward
 
05:02:59.750 --> 05:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
symbol of a family sacrifice so everyone
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
can see and understand the cost of
 
05:03:05.470 --> 05:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
freedom I will mention two things uh
 
05:03:08.430 --> 05:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
that one that Mark tooto mentioned the
 
05:03:10.110 --> 05:03:10.120 align:start position:0%
Run for the fallen and one that Andy
 
05:03:12.430 --> 05:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
Cruz just mentioned about um the
 
05:03:14.868 --> 05:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
recruiting wos um for our military
 
05:03:17.788 --> 05:03:17.798 align:start position:0%
across the board um Mark mentioned the
 
05:03:19.470 --> 05:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
Run for the Fallen that is held every
 
05:03:23.670 --> 05:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
year to recognize those um from 2018 on
 
05:03:26.390 --> 05:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
was basically the from any service
 
05:03:27.830 --> 05:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
member that was lost in the global war
 
05:03:29.670 --> 05:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
on terror either directly through
 
05:03:33.150 --> 05:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
training or suicide um this Year my
 
05:03:36.310 --> 05:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
sister and brother-in-law went to the um
 
05:03:39.030 --> 05:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
Run for the Fallen uh in New Hampshire
 
05:03:41.750 --> 05:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
and besides the immediate family members
 
05:03:44.030 --> 05:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
there and the runners there was no one
 
05:03:47.190 --> 05:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
else no one else remembered their
 
05:03:50.230 --> 05:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
sacrifice this is definitely a way where
 
05:03:52.830 --> 05:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
five times a year as a minimum the state
 
05:03:54.910 --> 05:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire can recognize those
 
05:03:56.990 --> 05:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
that have served our country and given
 
05:03:59.670 --> 05:03:59.680 align:start position:0%

remember we salute the flags and say
 
05:06:41.910 --> 05:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
05:06:45.430 --> 05:06:45.440 align:start position:0%

05:07:10.670 --> 05:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
well it means a lot for our family to
 
05:07:13.708 --> 05:07:13.718 align:start position:0%
see this flag fly whether it's Blake's
 
05:07:17.830 --> 05:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
flag at my aunt's house or one that
 
05:07:20.868 --> 05:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
flies over the stay house and we hope
 
05:07:23.788 --> 05:07:23.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:26.190 --> 05:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
will I've had multiple opportunities to
 
05:07:27.470 --> 05:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
talk to people who will walk by my
 
05:07:29.628 --> 05:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
aunt's house and they
 
05:07:32.350 --> 05:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
ask what is that flag and and what's it
 
05:07:34.590 --> 05:07:34.600 align:start position:0%
for because they don't know and it
 
05:07:36.230 --> 05:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
provides an opportunity to have that
 
05:07:39.390 --> 05:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
conversation so that people do
 
05:07:42.628 --> 05:07:42.638 align:start position:0%
understand that our members our military
 
05:07:44.868 --> 05:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
members are sacrificing themselves for
 
05:07:47.270 --> 05:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
us for our freedoms so that we can go
 
05:07:48.470 --> 05:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
about our
 
05:07:50.910 --> 05:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
lives in
 
05:07:54.070 --> 05:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
comfort and knowing
 
05:07:58.030 --> 05:07:58.040 align:start position:0%
that they will not be forgotten and it
 
05:08:00.030 --> 05:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
just allows us another way to remember
 
05:08:01.868 --> 05:08:01.878 align:start position:0%
them and make sure that their memory
 
05:08:03.470 --> 05:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
stays alive
 
05:08:07.070 --> 05:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
forever there's I I don't know exactly
 
05:08:12.628 --> 05:08:12.638 align:start position:0%
the uh no the uh best phrasing for this
 
05:08:15.670 --> 05:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
but when someone dies they die
 
05:08:18.510 --> 05:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
twice the day they die when their soul
 
05:08:19.430 --> 05:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
leaves their
 
05:08:23.708 --> 05:08:23.718 align:start position:0%
body and the second death is the day
 
05:08:27.390 --> 05:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
that someone's name is said for the last
 
05:08:30.868 --> 05:08:30.878 align:start position:0%
time this allows us another way to make
 
05:08:32.868 --> 05:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
sure that never happens
 
05:08:35.750 --> 05:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of when someone served or
 
05:08:37.390 --> 05:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
when they
 
05:08:39.510 --> 05:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
passed uh thank you if you have any
 
05:08:41.150 --> 05:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
questions I can the Happy Day answer
 
05:08:42.948 --> 05:08:42.958 align:start position:0%

05:10:01.030 --> 05:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative uh hi so I'm Eric
 
05:10:01.040 --> 05:10:02.628 align:start position:0%
representative uh hi so I'm Eric
gallager

05:10:02.628 --> 05:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
gallager
 
05:10:05.430 --> 05:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative for maram County District
 
05:10:12.270 --> 05:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
20 which is conquered Ward six um and um
 
05:10:14.030 --> 05:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
well I've actually got two bills here
 
05:10:18.350 --> 05:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
today but I guess um the starting with
 
05:10:22.310 --> 05:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
1096 um enabling the State House fit
 
05:10:25.150 --> 05:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
Center to sell state symbols that may
 
05:10:27.070 --> 05:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
have intellectual property rights
 
05:10:28.628 --> 05:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
holders so
 
05:10:28.638 --> 05:10:30.310 align:start position:0%
holders so
basically

05:10:30.310 --> 05:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
basically
 
05:10:35.548 --> 05:10:35.558 align:start position:0%
um where this idea came from was uh just
 
05:10:39.830 --> 05:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
in our previous term I believe we had a
 
05:10:42.030 --> 05:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
bill to
 
05:10:47.430 --> 05:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
um add an additional state song to our
 
05:10:52.470 --> 05:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
list of um State songs
 
05:10:52.480 --> 05:10:54.350 align:start position:0%
list of um State songs
um

05:10:54.350 --> 05:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:58.470 --> 05:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
and I I believe that what um some of the
 
05:11:01.190 --> 05:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
points raised during that debate were oh
 
05:11:01.200 --> 05:11:02.470 align:start position:0%
points raised during that debate were oh
well

05:11:02.470 --> 05:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:11:05.510 --> 05:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
we have a lot how um how many is that it
 
05:11:08.430 --> 05:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
was like 10 or something and I was
 
05:11:09.868 --> 05:11:09.878 align:start position:0%
thinking oh hey that sounds like the
 
05:11:15.670 --> 05:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
perfect um length of an album um and
 
05:11:21.190 --> 05:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
so I decided to go ask the um gift shop
 
05:11:23.788 --> 05:11:23.798 align:start position:0%
if they could uh
 
05:11:28.510 --> 05:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
sell an album of all of our St songs and
 
05:11:31.390 --> 05:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
um they said they weren't really quite
 
05:11:31.400 --> 05:11:32.470 align:start position:0%
um they said they weren't really quite
sure

05:11:32.470 --> 05:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:11:36.070 --> 05:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
um because of the some some of them have
 
05:11:39.910 --> 05:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
um intellectual property rights attached
 
05:11:43.590 --> 05:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:47.310 --> 05:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
um that they weren't quite sure how to
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
handle um so this is basically just to
 
05:11:52.030 --> 05:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
clarify that
 
05:11:56.548 --> 05:11:56.558 align:start position:0%
situation um yeah it's
 
05:12:00.990 --> 05:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
um so yeah we have a big state symbol
 
05:12:02.470 --> 05:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
section of
 
05:12:07.070 --> 05:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
um so it mentions such as State Songs it
 
05:12:10.190 --> 05:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
would presumably also apply to um
 
05:12:14.628 --> 05:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
other state symbols with um like I I
 
05:12:17.868 --> 05:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
think there's um state or state poems or
 
05:12:21.030 --> 05:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
something too that this might also apply
 
05:12:23.910 --> 05:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
to um
 
05:12:23.920 --> 05:12:26.030 align:start position:0%
to um
so

05:12:26.030 --> 05:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:12:29.110 --> 05:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's a pretty simple Bild just
 
05:12:32.868 --> 05:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
four lines uh so I'll take any questions
 
05:12:34.788 --> 05:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
now thank you very much for your
 
05:12:36.230 --> 05:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions from
 
05:12:36.240 --> 05:12:38.350 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions from
the

05:12:38.350 --> 05:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:12:41.470 --> 05:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
committee R Pearson thank you madam
 
05:12:43.430 --> 05:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
chair representative Gallagher thank you
 
05:12:45.670 --> 05:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
for coming today and
 
05:12:48.628 --> 05:12:48.638 align:start position:0%
presenting this legislation to the
 
05:12:51.788 --> 05:12:51.798 align:start position:0%
committee uh you mentioned a state song
 
05:12:54.390 --> 05:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
as an example um and some other state
 
05:12:57.150 --> 05:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
symbols are are you aware that in most
 
05:13:00.868 --> 05:13:00.878 align:start position:0%
cases when those are adopted the creator
 
05:13:04.110 --> 05:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:07.948 --> 05:13:07.958 align:start position:0%
surrenders their rights to those to the
 
05:13:10.270 --> 05:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
state as part of that
 
05:13:14.070 --> 05:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
process um if that's the case then
 
05:13:17.350 --> 05:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
that's good to hear
 
05:13:22.270 --> 05:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
um the thing is um that
 
05:13:24.910 --> 05:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
um well it's just a point that there
 
05:13:27.070 --> 05:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
hasn't really been much Clarity on like
 
05:13:30.750 --> 05:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
I remember it coming up um in the
 
05:13:33.430 --> 05:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
previous debate we had about adopting a
 
05:13:35.788 --> 05:13:35.798 align:start position:0%
new state song was about the
 
05:13:37.830 --> 05:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
intellectual property rights and then
 
05:13:41.470 --> 05:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
also um just for figuring out why we
 
05:13:43.110 --> 05:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
weren't already doing this it's just
 
05:13:46.150 --> 05:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
because there was some uncertainty so um
 
05:13:46.160 --> 05:13:47.270 align:start position:0%
because there was some uncertainty so um
yeah

05:13:47.270 --> 05:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:13:51.670 --> 05:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
if um if they already can then um if
 
05:13:55.230 --> 05:13:55.240 align:start position:0%
this is already handled then that's um
 
05:13:57.470 --> 05:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's good to hear um but I just think
 
05:14:00.150 --> 05:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
some additional Clarity would be useful
 
05:14:02.190 --> 05:14:02.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure it's
 
05:14:02.200 --> 05:14:05.310 align:start position:0%
to make sure it's
specified

05:14:05.310 --> 05:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:08.270 --> 05:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
explicitly thank you very much uh
 
05:14:08.280 --> 05:14:10.030 align:start position:0%
explicitly thank you very much uh
representative

05:14:10.030 --> 05:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:14:12.750 --> 05:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
mcarter thank you madam chair um thank
 
05:14:14.708 --> 05:14:14.718 align:start position:0%
you for coming today uh representative
 
05:14:18.110 --> 05:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
Gallagher I did have um I'll be at a
 
05:14:20.910 --> 05:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
brief description with Virginia from the
 
05:14:24.510 --> 05:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
gift uh the gift shop today uh last week
 
05:14:26.788 --> 05:14:26.798 align:start position:0%
maybe I think it was uh she did say she
 
05:14:28.948 --> 05:14:28.958 align:start position:0%
was going to come today is she here yeah
 
05:14:30.750 --> 05:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
I see her in the audience um I'd be
 
05:14:33.708 --> 05:14:33.718 align:start position:0%
interested if if you can um listen to
 
05:14:37.750 --> 05:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
her her explanation about um the
 
05:14:39.830 --> 05:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
intellectual property type of
 
05:14:43.548 --> 05:14:43.558 align:start position:0%
arrangement and with it with its uh
 
05:14:45.868 --> 05:14:45.878 align:start position:0%
state symbols being having to have
 
05:14:48.030 --> 05:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
approval from the Secretary of State's
 
05:14:49.990 --> 05:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
office because they're almost not
 
05:14:52.948 --> 05:14:52.958 align:start position:0%
copyrighted but a similar type of U
 
05:14:56.390 --> 05:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
protection on those um on those symbols
 
05:14:59.390 --> 05:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
so I I wonder if youve if you've thought
 
05:15:01.990 --> 05:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
about maybe speaking with the secret of
 
05:15:06.788 --> 05:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
State's office as well um I I mean yes I
 
05:15:11.868 --> 05:15:11.878 align:start position:0%
or uh I talked with uh Virginia myself
 
05:15:16.190 --> 05:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
when um preparing this bill um I don't
 
05:15:18.150 --> 05:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
think she mentioned anything about the
 
05:15:21.868 --> 05:15:21.878 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office at the time
 
05:15:26.548 --> 05:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
um but um having that additional lead is
 
05:15:31.788 --> 05:15:31.798 align:start position:0%
useful and um yeah if uh I mean well
 
05:15:33.548 --> 05:15:33.558 align:start position:0%
Virginia is going to speak after you so
 
05:15:36.750 --> 05:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
she can probably speak to that I I was
 
05:15:38.910 --> 05:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
just looking to see if there's anyone
 
05:15:40.830 --> 05:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
from the Secretary of State's office and

05:16:04.628 --> 05:16:04.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and I'd
 
05:16:08.070 --> 05:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:12.990 --> 05:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
Drew who signed in uh to oppose this
 
05:16:18.548 --> 05:16:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:20.590 --> 05:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
Administration for the record it's
 
05:16:22.510 --> 05:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
Virginia drew the State House Visitors
 
05:16:25.750 --> 05:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
Center Director um I will say I've been
 
05:16:28.470 --> 05:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
the in The Visitor Center for over 20
 
05:16:31.670 --> 05:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
years I appreciate representative
 
05:16:35.390 --> 05:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
Gallagher's intent to try to make things
 
05:16:39.070 --> 05:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
easier and um hold other items in the
 
05:16:42.830 --> 05:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
visitor center but I did discourage that
 
05:16:44.830 --> 05:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
this legislation I didn't think was
 
05:16:47.868 --> 05:16:47.878 align:start position:0%
necessary I still feel that I will do
 
05:16:50.110 --> 05:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
clarification the Secretary of State
 
05:16:52.868 --> 05:16:52.878 align:start position:0%
holds the authority over the state seal
 
05:16:54.548 --> 05:16:54.558 align:start position:0%
and in The Visitor Center we have
 
05:16:56.868 --> 05:16:56.878 align:start position:0%
approval to have certain items with the
 
05:17:00.548 --> 05:17:00.558 align:start position:0%
state seal anything else um we we
 
05:17:03.070 --> 05:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
basically stick to very general items in
 
05:17:07.350 --> 05:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
the visitor center and thank you thank
 
05:17:08.590 --> 05:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony will
 
05:17:10.708 --> 05:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
you take questions yes any questions
 
05:17:12.190 --> 05:17:12.200 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:17:16.110 --> 05:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
committee R Pearson I'd be lost in this
 
05:17:17.788 --> 05:17:17.798 align:start position:0%
incredible opportunity to have you on
 
05:17:19.510 --> 05:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
the other side of a
 
05:17:23.868 --> 05:17:23.878 align:start position:0%
microphone so um but in the sense that
 
05:17:26.948 --> 05:17:26.958 align:start position:0%
the visitor center does sell a
 
05:17:29.548 --> 05:17:29.558 align:start position:0%
product to the public and to the folks
 
05:17:31.948 --> 05:17:31.958 align:start position:0%
that do come to this this very very
 
05:17:33.868 --> 05:17:33.878 align:start position:0%
ancient State
 
05:17:37.990 --> 05:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
House have you found the desire for
 
05:17:39.548 --> 05:17:39.558 align:start position:0%
people to come and purchase something
 
05:17:43.190 --> 05:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
that you can't sell that would fall that
 
05:17:44.708 --> 05:17:44.718 align:start position:0%
would fall under the intent of what
 
05:17:47.868 --> 05:17:47.878 align:start position:0%
we're doing here no it hasn't come
 
05:17:50.628 --> 05:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
before and I did mention that there are
 
05:17:53.310 --> 05:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of items that our state symbols
 
05:17:55.868 --> 05:17:55.878 align:start position:0%
that would not be appropriate to carry
 
05:17:59.070 --> 05:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
in a visitor center such as pumpkin
 
05:18:05.070 --> 05:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:07.110 --> 05:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
folks any other
 
05:18:08.990 --> 05:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
05:18:11.868 --> 05:18:11.878 align:start position:0%

05:18:14.270 --> 05:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
pink cards for HB 1096 I'm going to
 
05:18:30.310 --> 05:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:30.320 --> 05:19:00.230 align:start position:0%
 
hearing

05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:00.240 --> 05:19:20.750 align:start position:0%
 
for

05:19:20.750 --> 05:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:23.910 --> 05:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
May is a little past 2:15 I'm going to

1367 and uh we have uh the prime sponsor
 
05:19:36.270 --> 05:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
rep gall back on the hot seat yep um hi
 
05:19:39.030 --> 05:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
so yeah again I'm representative Eric
 
05:19:43.310 --> 05:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
Galler representing May County District
 
05:19:46.910 --> 05:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
20 which is conquered W 6 um I'm here
 
05:19:51.150 --> 05:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
now to introduce House Bill 1367
 
05:19:54.070 --> 05:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
relative to establishing immunity for
 
05:19:57.350 --> 05:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
certain testimony in public legislative
 
05:19:59.830 --> 05:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
hearings so
 
05:20:02.470 --> 05:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah as
 
05:20:06.590 --> 05:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
legislators uh basically what we do here
 
05:20:10.350 --> 05:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
is we make determinations we make laws
 
05:20:13.510 --> 05:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
about things about um what we think
 
05:20:19.390 --> 05:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
should be legal or illegal and um when
 
05:20:23.190 --> 05:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
we do that we have this process where we
 
05:20:26.070 --> 05:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
have hearings like this one to discuss
 
05:20:30.548 --> 05:20:30.558 align:start position:0%
the um activity in question and we're
 
05:20:32.590 --> 05:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
actually kind of unique in New Hampshire
 
05:20:34.470 --> 05:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
here and that we have open public
 
05:20:37.788 --> 05:20:37.798 align:start position:0%
hearings where anyone can come
 
05:20:42.270 --> 05:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
testify um and I think that's a good
 
05:20:45.310 --> 05:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
thing I think being able to hear from as
 
05:20:49.708 --> 05:20:49.718 align:start position:0%
many people as possible um
 
05:20:53.110 --> 05:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
is um a great opportunity that we have
 
05:20:55.390 --> 05:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
before us
 
05:20:55.400 --> 05:20:57.270 align:start position:0%
before us
um

05:20:57.270 --> 05:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:01.110 --> 05:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
so sometimes when I've been um trying
 
05:21:01.120 --> 05:21:01.990 align:start position:0%
so sometimes when I've been um trying
trying

05:21:01.990 --> 05:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
trying
 
05:21:08.350 --> 05:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
to uh convince people to um come testify
 
05:21:08.360 --> 05:21:09.510 align:start position:0%
to uh convince people to um come testify
about

05:21:09.510 --> 05:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:21:11.310 --> 05:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
something uh
 
05:21:15.750 --> 05:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
they've expressed um some concern that
 
05:21:17.788 --> 05:21:17.798 align:start position:0%
their testimony could get them in
 
05:21:20.948 --> 05:21:20.958 align:start position:0%
trouble somehow so
 
05:21:20.958 --> 05:21:22.590 align:start position:0%
trouble somehow so
um

05:21:22.590 --> 05:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:29.190 --> 05:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh I have introduced this bill to um
 
05:21:33.948 --> 05:21:33.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:38.990 --> 05:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
um in um improve the um amount and
 
05:21:43.590 --> 05:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
veracity of the testimony we receive in
 
05:21:45.910 --> 05:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
hearings like this
 
05:21:45.920 --> 05:21:49.150 align:start position:0%
hearings like this
um

05:21:49.150 --> 05:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:51.990 --> 05:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh um yeah I think we should be making
 
05:21:55.190 --> 05:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
our decisions with all the relevant
 
05:21:58.310 --> 05:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
information available um especially from
 
05:22:01.750 --> 05:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
the people in question who
 
05:22:04.750 --> 05:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
bills would affect
 
05:22:04.760 --> 05:22:06.510 align:start position:0%
bills would affect
um

05:22:06.510 --> 05:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:06.520 --> 05:22:08.470 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:22:08.470 --> 05:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:22:12.990 --> 05:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah about this bill um so it's
 
05:22:16.470 --> 05:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
neutral um in terms of it's not
 
05:22:19.150 --> 05:22:19.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily pro- legalizing things or
 
05:22:22.628 --> 05:22:22.638 align:start position:0%
Pro or anti- legalizing things um the S
 
05:22:24.830 --> 05:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
it would protect both kinds of testimony
 
05:22:28.750 --> 05:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
like both people saying oh this illegal
 
05:22:31.390 --> 05:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
activity caused a lot of harm to me and
 
05:22:32.708 --> 05:22:32.718 align:start position:0%
I believe it should be restricted
 
05:22:37.470 --> 05:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
further or um also the testimony of oh
 
05:22:40.350 --> 05:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
this illegal activity is actually
 
05:22:42.990 --> 05:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
harmless and should be
 
05:22:43.000 --> 05:22:44.708 align:start position:0%
harmless and should be
legalized

05:22:44.708 --> 05:22:44.718 align:start position:0%
legalized
 
05:22:49.470 --> 05:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
um so uh I discussed this
 
05:22:52.830 --> 05:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
um I discussed this legislation with the
 
05:22:56.390 --> 05:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
ACLU um one concern they said I might
 
05:22:59.750 --> 05:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
face would be like oh well um yeah
 
05:23:01.910 --> 05:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
people might ask oh well couldn't
 
05:23:04.628 --> 05:23:04.638 align:start position:0%
someone take advantage of this to uh get
 
05:23:07.270 --> 05:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
away with murder or some other heinous
 
05:23:11.070 --> 05:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
crime or something and
 
05:23:16.110 --> 05:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
so um I took that feedback and um yeah
 
05:23:18.590 --> 05:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
put in uh redraft request which is
 
05:23:22.310 --> 05:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
reflected in the bill um to add the um
 
05:23:25.948 --> 05:23:25.958 align:start position:0%
relevance Criterion um the part where it
 
05:23:27.750 --> 05:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
says the order of immunity shall be
 
05:23:30.430 --> 05:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
restricted only to cover testimony
 
05:23:32.270 --> 05:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
concerning potential criminal conduct
 
05:23:33.750 --> 05:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
related to the statute that is the
 
05:23:34.948 --> 05:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
subject of the
 
05:23:40.788 --> 05:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
hearing um so yeah for example with
 
05:23:40.798 --> 05:23:43.150 align:start position:0%
hearing um so yeah for example with
um

05:23:43.150 --> 05:23:43.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:46.868 --> 05:23:46.878 align:start position:0%
for this bill um HB
 
05:23:51.150 --> 05:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
1367 the statute in question is R RSA
 
05:23:56.670 --> 05:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
14 uh section 14 C so um it would be
 
05:24:01.310 --> 05:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
only testimony related to um that
 
05:24:06.230 --> 05:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
portion that would be covered um
 
05:24:10.030 --> 05:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
so and also um the chair has
 
05:24:13.868 --> 05:24:13.878 align:start position:0%
to this is um a decision being made
 
05:24:19.030 --> 05:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
by the chair of whether or not to Grant
 
05:24:23.830 --> 05:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
this or not um so I I personally think
 
05:24:29.230 --> 05:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
um those two factors um the relevance
 
05:24:31.628 --> 05:24:31.638 align:start position:0%
Criterion and the fact that the chair
 
05:24:34.470 --> 05:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
has to grant grant it are ought to be
 
05:24:36.548 --> 05:24:36.558 align:start position:0%
enough of a safeguard but um if the
 
05:24:38.350 --> 05:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
committee would like to add additional
 
05:24:41.590 --> 05:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
safeguards like say maybe distinguishing
 
05:24:44.708 --> 05:24:44.718 align:start position:0%
between violent and non-violent crimes
 
05:24:46.430 --> 05:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
or maybe distinguishing between
 
05:24:49.510 --> 05:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors and felonies or certain
 
05:24:50.590 --> 05:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
classes of
 
05:24:54.628 --> 05:24:54.638 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor um I'd be open to that too
 
05:24:57.430 --> 05:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
um the only reason I didn't do that
 
05:25:00.470 --> 05:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
myself is because um I wasn't quite sure
 
05:25:01.470 --> 05:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
how how
 
05:25:05.590 --> 05:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
to go about um wording it
 
05:25:05.600 --> 05:25:08.350 align:start position:0%
to go about um wording it
specifically

05:25:08.350 --> 05:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
05:25:08.360 --> 05:25:11.190 align:start position:0%
specifically
um

05:25:11.190 --> 05:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:15.628 --> 05:25:15.638 align:start position:0%
so yeah uh I I think this bill is
 
05:25:15.638 --> 05:25:17.310 align:start position:0%
so yeah uh I I think this bill is
consistent

05:25:17.310 --> 05:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
05:25:20.750 --> 05:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
with um existing principles of law we've
 
05:25:24.990 --> 05:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
got the um we've got the Fifth Amendment
 
05:25:26.548 --> 05:25:26.558 align:start position:0%
right against
 
05:25:29.990 --> 05:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
self-incrimination that implies it in uh
 
05:25:31.868 --> 05:25:31.878 align:start position:0%
Court proceedings I think that um we
 
05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
should make sure to clarify that um
 
05:25:39.830 --> 05:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
it uh applies in legislative hearings
 
05:25:45.708 --> 05:25:45.718 align:start position:0%
too um so that way we can uh get the um
 
05:25:49.350 --> 05:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
best testimony with which to make the
 
05:25:51.430 --> 05:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
best decisions about the bills we
 
05:25:54.150 --> 05:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
consider and I'll take questions now
 
05:25:56.430 --> 05:25:56.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony R Pearson
 
05:25:58.628 --> 05:25:58.638 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair representative
 
05:26:01.390 --> 05:26:01.400 align:start position:0%
gallager um are you aware that when you
 
05:26:03.070 --> 05:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
testify in front of a house committee
 
05:26:05.470 --> 05:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
you are you are not only are you not
 
05:26:07.750 --> 05:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
under subpoena but you're not under oath
 
05:26:09.868 --> 05:26:09.878 align:start position:0%
so therefore no
 
05:26:12.708 --> 05:26:12.718 align:start position:0%
one is ever required sitting in that
 
05:26:14.230 --> 05:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
seat to answer a question that's brought
 
05:26:16.270 --> 05:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
before him by a house
 
05:26:18.948 --> 05:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
committee um well
 
05:26:24.628 --> 05:26:24.638 align:start position:0%
so yes that's true but um sometimes the
 
05:26:27.070 --> 05:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
um well there there can still be kind of
 
05:26:29.750 --> 05:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
a chilling effect in the first place of
 
05:26:33.070 --> 05:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
somebody who thinks thinks that
 
05:26:36.310 --> 05:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
um who thinks that they might be put in
 
05:26:40.670 --> 05:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
a sort of situation where that comes up
 
05:26:43.150 --> 05:26:43.160 align:start position:0%
um it it's not
 
05:26:46.628 --> 05:26:46.638 align:start position:0%
um it it's more about being able to make
 
05:26:49.350 --> 05:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
it easier to convince people that it's
 
05:26:50.830 --> 05:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
safe for them to
 
05:26:54.310 --> 05:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
testify um
 
05:26:54.320 --> 05:26:57.230 align:start position:0%
testify um
and

05:26:57.230 --> 05:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:27:01.510 --> 05:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I I think um
 
05:27:06.788 --> 05:27:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:10.868 --> 05:27:10.878 align:start position:0%
way um to do that would be just to not
 
05:27:14.430 --> 05:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
answer a question um I think it would be
 
05:27:16.750 --> 05:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
better if people could answer the
 
05:27:19.310 --> 05:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
question um and provide the full
 
05:27:22.350 --> 05:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
information um rather than having to go
 
05:27:24.310 --> 05:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
the not answering the question route
 
05:27:29.070 --> 05:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
just um so we can get the uh full
 
05:27:31.030 --> 05:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
information thank you are there any
 
05:27:33.990 --> 05:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
other questions rip
 
05:27:36.310 --> 05:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
tuny thank you madam chair thank you for
 
05:27:40.350 --> 05:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question so your bill is
 
05:27:43.750 --> 05:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
proposing that an individual sitting his
 
05:27:47.670 --> 05:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
chair that in most cases probably has no
 
05:27:50.510 --> 05:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
legal experience
 
05:27:54.270 --> 05:27:54.280 align:start position:0%
whatsoever is going to make a decision
 
05:27:56.150 --> 05:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
as to
 
05:27:59.430 --> 05:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
immunity for uh somebody
 
05:27:59.440 --> 05:28:06.310 align:start position:0%
immunity for uh somebody
testifying

05:28:06.310 --> 05:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:09.230 --> 05:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
um well I
 
05:28:12.628 --> 05:28:12.638 align:start position:0%
mean you know we're the the fact that
 
05:28:14.430 --> 05:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
05:28:17.270 --> 05:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
lawyers we we still make laws about this
 
05:28:20.590 --> 05:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
in the first um anyways um I I don't see
 
05:28:24.868 --> 05:28:24.878 align:start position:0%
how the fact that uh we're not
 
05:28:29.390 --> 05:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
lawyers uh really would restrict the
 
05:28:32.868 --> 05:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
decision to Grant immunity any more than
 
05:28:40.470 --> 05:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:44.150 --> 05:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
place you're right we make laws here and
 
05:28:47.030 --> 05:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
many times they get struck down by
 
05:28:50.350 --> 05:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
lawyers in the Supreme Court uh or a
 
05:28:53.470 --> 05:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
lower court first then the Supreme Court
 
05:28:56.350 --> 05:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
um what you're proposing would Grant
 
05:29:01.548 --> 05:29:01.558 align:start position:0%
folks to come up here and say okay uh um
 
05:29:05.510 --> 05:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
I know uh cannabis helps medically but
 
05:29:08.750 --> 05:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
it also helps my mood so that's why I
 
05:29:10.948 --> 05:29:10.958 align:start position:0%
smoke it even though that's
 
05:29:13.708 --> 05:29:13.718 align:start position:0%
illegal um yeah I think that it would be
 
05:29:16.470 --> 05:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
useful to hear from people right but
 
05:29:19.070 --> 05:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
they're breaking a law yeah that
 
05:29:21.070 --> 05:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
currently is on the
 
05:29:25.390 --> 05:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
books and according to this
 
05:29:27.510 --> 05:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative shien would be able to
 
05:29:29.948 --> 05:29:29.958 align:start position:0%
say you have blanket Immunity on or
 
05:29:32.708 --> 05:29:32.718 align:start position:0%
you'd have immunity for your testimony
 
05:29:34.868 --> 05:29:34.878 align:start position:0%
and she's not a lawyer knowing where
 
05:29:36.910 --> 05:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
does this fit in the pecking
 
05:29:42.350 --> 05:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:42.360 --> 05:29:45.868 align:start position:0%
 
law

05:29:45.868 --> 05:29:45.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:49.628 --> 05:29:49.638 align:start position:0%
um well so yeah
 
05:29:51.948 --> 05:29:51.958 align:start position:0%
it what so one one other thing to
 
05:29:54.868 --> 05:29:54.878 align:start position:0%
mention is um the immunity applies
 
05:29:59.230 --> 05:29:59.240 align:start position:0%
specifically to um the their
 
05:30:05.708 --> 05:30:05.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:09.430 --> 05:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
um yeah it it's not like it's not like a
 
05:30:11.788 --> 05:30:11.798 align:start position:0%
blanket immunity it just means that
 
05:30:14.390 --> 05:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
their testimony specifically that
 
05:30:16.868 --> 05:30:16.878 align:start position:0%
they're providing here for the purposes
 
05:30:20.310 --> 05:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
of us being able to decide how we want
 
05:30:24.350 --> 05:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
to vote on things um can't be used
 
05:30:24.360 --> 05:30:27.548 align:start position:0%
to vote on things um can't be used
against

05:30:27.548 --> 05:30:27.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:30.868 --> 05:30:30.878 align:start position:0%
them representative wall
 
05:30:32.310 --> 05:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you for
 
05:30:35.548 --> 05:30:35.558 align:start position:0%
your testimony um I've been here a long
 
05:30:37.910 --> 05:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
time and I served about 30 some odd
 
05:30:39.750 --> 05:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
years on the Judiciary Committee we
 
05:30:43.390 --> 05:30:43.400 align:start position:0%
dealt with some very very sensitive
 
05:30:46.830 --> 05:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
issues and people could have gotten into
 
05:30:48.510 --> 05:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
some kind of problems as you're
 
05:30:50.868 --> 05:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
suggesting but usually when people
 
05:30:53.990 --> 05:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
testify they're testifying purely on the
 
05:30:56.510 --> 05:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
facts and not on their behavior or
 
05:31:00.350 --> 05:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
something like that um we do have with
 
05:31:04.150 --> 05:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
our right to no law specific times when
 
05:31:07.590 --> 05:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
we can go into non-public session I've
 
05:31:09.350 --> 05:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
never known a committee in this house to
 
05:31:12.230 --> 05:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
do that except the Ethics
 
05:31:15.590 --> 05:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
Committee and I can't imagine a
 
05:31:18.548 --> 05:31:18.558 align:start position:0%
committee where immunity would be
 
05:31:21.270 --> 05:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
necessary except on something like the
 
05:31:23.990 --> 05:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee and again we have the
 
05:31:26.070 --> 05:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
right to no law which is very specific
 
05:31:29.470 --> 05:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of when we can offer people the
 
05:31:31.270 --> 05:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
chance to go into to nonpublic session
 
05:31:35.590 --> 05:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
and not feel the uh judgment or concerns
 
05:31:38.030 --> 05:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
of others are you aware of
 
05:31:38.040 --> 05:31:42.628 align:start position:0%
of others are you aware of
that

05:31:42.628 --> 05:31:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:48.948 --> 05:31:48.958 align:start position:0%
um yes I uh I am familiar with 91a and
 
05:31:54.110 --> 05:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
that it has Provisions for um non-public
 
05:32:02.230 --> 05:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:04.548 --> 05:32:04.558 align:start position:0%
uh I I I don't I don't think people
 
05:32:07.030 --> 05:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
should have to be in private to be
 
05:32:09.270 --> 05:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
honest with their testimony I think they
 
05:32:12.270 --> 05:32:12.280 align:start position:0%
should be able to uh do that in public
 
05:32:12.280 --> 05:32:14.390 align:start position:0%
should be able to uh do that in public
as

05:32:14.390 --> 05:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:32:16.548 --> 05:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
well R
 
05:32:20.470 --> 05:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
mcarter thank you madam chair so uh Reb
 
05:32:23.708 --> 05:32:23.718 align:start position:0%
Gallagher you I can understand where
 
05:32:26.270 --> 05:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
you're where you're I kind of almost
 
05:32:27.670 --> 05:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from with
 
05:32:27.680 --> 05:32:29.030 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from with
this

05:32:29.030 --> 05:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:32:32.350 --> 05:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
however Let's uh you could certainly
 
05:32:34.350 --> 05:32:34.360 align:start position:0%
explore many different types of subject
 
05:32:37.110 --> 05:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
matter for uh statute building that we
 
05:32:40.230 --> 05:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
do here every time we're in session um
 
05:32:42.830 --> 05:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
in a in a meeting let's say for example
 
05:32:45.708 --> 05:32:45.718 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to put forth a bill for
 
05:32:47.750 --> 05:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
oh I don't know a brothel they're legal
 
05:32:49.190 --> 05:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that's what the intent
 
05:32:53.628 --> 05:32:53.638 align:start position:0%
of the bill is um does that make it what
 
05:32:57.150 --> 05:32:57.160 align:start position:0%
the behavior is legal now no so you're
 
05:32:59.150 --> 05:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
going to want to have people come in and
 
05:33:01.190 --> 05:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh testify to how wonderful it will be
 
05:33:03.230 --> 05:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
if we have brothel all over the state we
 
05:33:05.990 --> 05:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
already do it we just you don't know
 
05:33:09.110 --> 05:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
about it yet or it's under the radar you
 
05:33:11.750 --> 05:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to have people coming in to
 
05:33:15.270 --> 05:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh to try to sell the idea why wouldn't
 
05:33:17.948 --> 05:33:17.958 align:start position:0%
they just come and sell in
 
05:33:21.990 --> 05:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
hyperbole uh wouldn't it be nice if
 
05:33:23.750 --> 05:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
instead of saying we already do this
 
05:33:25.470 --> 05:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
it's the same they're giving the same
 
05:33:27.230 --> 05:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
information they're not admitting to
 
05:33:28.948 --> 05:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
anything they're not saying they don't
 
05:33:32.030 --> 05:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
either though uh so where does the
 
05:33:34.590 --> 05:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
social hierarchy start you're looking to
 
05:33:37.948 --> 05:33:37.958 align:start position:0%
not uh have them held com uh
 
05:33:43.470 --> 05:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
criminally uh uh liable for for their
 
05:33:46.070 --> 05:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
testimony but that doesn't remove the
 
05:33:48.670 --> 05:33:48.680 align:start position:0%
social consequence or perhaps employment
 
05:33:50.110 --> 05:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
consequence should their boss be
 
05:33:51.750 --> 05:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
watching the YouTube stream of this
 
05:33:53.948 --> 05:33:53.958 align:start position:0%
committee it doesn't remove any of the
 
05:33:57.948 --> 05:33:57.958 align:start position:0%
other a stigmatic one uh you know that
 
05:34:00.868 --> 05:34:00.878 align:start position:0%
it it it just removes enforcement's
 
05:34:04.708 --> 05:34:04.718 align:start position:0%
ability to uh utilize that in a fashion
 
05:34:07.150 --> 05:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
that's already designed in statute so I
 
05:34:09.470 --> 05:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
think it's more of a package what you're
 
05:34:11.990 --> 05:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish here than just
 
05:34:14.990 --> 05:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
removing you know the the criminal
 
05:34:19.430 --> 05:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
aspect of this am I am I incorrect
 
05:34:21.270 --> 05:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
um I
 
05:34:25.390 --> 05:34:25.400 align:start position:0%
mean I think the criminal aspect is
 
05:34:28.548 --> 05:34:28.558 align:start position:0%
pretty much the only thing we can modify
 
05:34:30.510 --> 05:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
through the law the rest of the stuff
 
05:34:34.990 --> 05:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
like cultural stigmas and stuff aren't
 
05:34:38.230 --> 05:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
really that that's not the the law isn't
 
05:34:40.750 --> 05:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
the right Avenue to be addressing those
 
05:34:43.708 --> 05:34:43.718 align:start position:0%
sorts of things that that would be like
 
05:34:48.470 --> 05:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
we just have to convince people not to
 
05:34:53.430 --> 05:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
um stigmatize people who um who decide
 
05:34:56.590 --> 05:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
they want to be honest and make
 
05:34:59.190 --> 05:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
confessions about um things that they've
 
05:34:59.200 --> 05:35:01.750 align:start position:0%
confessions about um things that they've
done

05:35:01.750 --> 05:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:35:03.510 --> 05:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
rip oh follow up
 
05:35:03.520 --> 05:35:05.350 align:start position:0%
rip oh follow up
yeah

05:35:05.350 --> 05:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:35:07.868 --> 05:35:07.878 align:start position:0%
so uh being the structure of a
 
05:35:09.670 --> 05:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
legislature that we are wouldn't you
 
05:35:14.708 --> 05:35:14.718 align:start position:0%
think that um it might be more of a a a
 
05:35:19.430 --> 05:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable Avenue for someone uh this uh
 
05:35:21.990 --> 05:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
this um fictitious person that we're
 
05:35:24.270 --> 05:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
talking about in this circumstance they
 
05:35:26.548 --> 05:35:26.558 align:start position:0%
go to their representative and propose
 
05:35:28.750 --> 05:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
something hey why don't we why don't you
 
05:35:31.310 --> 05:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
get out there and make this legal right
 
05:35:33.708 --> 05:35:33.718 align:start position:0%
and then you being the representative
 
05:35:36.030 --> 05:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
maybe not you specifically the mayor or
 
05:35:37.990 --> 05:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
whomever uh we're supposed to go and
 
05:35:40.670 --> 05:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
advocate for the for the proposition or
 
05:35:43.150 --> 05:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
the proposal and try to get Buy in from
 
05:35:45.830 --> 05:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
the other legislators so that doesn't
 
05:35:47.708 --> 05:35:47.718 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that person has to come
 
05:35:49.670 --> 05:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
and testify for something that may be
 
05:35:53.270 --> 05:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
deemed as a criminal activity uh it's
 
05:35:55.190 --> 05:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's the way the the representative
 
05:35:59.750 --> 05:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
comes in and makes the proposal in hyper
 
05:36:01.910 --> 05:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
pathetical terms I I just don't see
 
05:36:04.708 --> 05:36:04.718 align:start position:0%
where this legislation is is needed at
 
05:36:08.310 --> 05:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
this point well so yes I um you could
 
05:36:10.990 --> 05:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
send someone else to testify on your
 
05:36:14.310 --> 05:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
behalf but um I think secondhand
 
05:36:16.310 --> 05:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
testimony is never really quite as good
 
05:36:18.788 --> 05:36:18.798 align:start position:0%
as firsthand testimony like we're we're
 
05:36:20.670 --> 05:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
all familiar with the game of telephone
 
05:36:23.948 --> 05:36:23.958 align:start position:0%
here right you know where you pass a
 
05:36:26.750 --> 05:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
message along between a a bunch of
 
05:36:31.190 --> 05:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
different people and um get a different
 
05:36:35.190 --> 05:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
result at the end uh I think I think um
 
05:36:37.310 --> 05:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
that's something
 
05:36:42.390 --> 05:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
to um worth um addressing is to try to
 
05:36:46.150 --> 05:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
avoid the information loss that uh comes
 
05:36:48.990 --> 05:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
with having to send someone else to
 
05:36:51.510 --> 05:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
testify for
 
05:36:54.948 --> 05:36:54.958 align:start position:0%
you rep ning
 
05:36:57.628 --> 05:36:57.638 align:start position:0%
Wong hey just wanted to ask if um this
 
05:37:00.470 --> 05:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
is an issue you've run in a lot and if
 
05:37:02.788 --> 05:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
it has happened more recently since
 
05:37:05.350 --> 05:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
we've started streaming on the
 
05:37:08.548 --> 05:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
internet um I mean this is only my
 
05:37:11.230 --> 05:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
second term in office so I don't think
 
05:37:11.240 --> 05:37:12.070 align:start position:0%
second term in office so I don't think
I've

05:37:12.070 --> 05:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
I've
 
05:37:17.310 --> 05:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
really been here long enough to
 
05:37:21.310 --> 05:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
um be able to make any sort of time
 
05:37:21.320 --> 05:37:22.830 align:start position:0%
um be able to make any sort of time
scale

05:37:22.830 --> 05:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
scale
 
05:37:22.840 --> 05:37:24.948 align:start position:0%
scale
comparisons

05:37:24.948 --> 05:37:24.958 align:start position:0%
comparisons
 
05:37:27.788 --> 05:37:27.798 align:start position:0%
um but
 
05:37:30.788 --> 05:37:30.798 align:start position:0%
um yeah it it it is something that I
 
05:37:34.270 --> 05:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
have encountered when talking with
 
05:37:36.230 --> 05:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
constituents or members of interest
 
05:37:45.270 --> 05:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:48.948 --> 05:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
testifying any other questions yeah
 
05:37:51.510 --> 05:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh on at the end
 
05:37:52.868 --> 05:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
of this you
 
05:37:56.070 --> 05:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
specifically address criminal
 
05:38:00.270 --> 05:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
cases you do not mention civil cases and
 
05:38:01.548 --> 05:38:01.558 align:start position:0%
was that a
 
05:38:03.670 --> 05:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
consideration that you gave when you
 
05:38:06.470 --> 05:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
drafted this or is was that an oversight
 
05:38:08.948 --> 05:38:08.958 align:start position:0%
to leave the Civil side of the law out
 
05:38:08.958 --> 05:38:09.708 align:start position:0%
to leave the Civil side of the law out
of

05:38:09.708 --> 05:38:09.718 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:38:09.718 --> 05:38:14.190 align:start position:0%
of
this

05:38:14.190 --> 05:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:17.270 --> 05:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
um I I I think criminal cases are my
 
05:38:19.150 --> 05:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
primary concern
 
05:38:19.160 --> 05:38:24.830 align:start position:0%
primary concern
um

05:38:24.830 --> 05:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:27.390 --> 05:38:27.400 align:start position:0%

05:38:29.110 --> 05:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
how I'm going to answer it I just think

05:39:46.190 --> 05:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
used an alias and in fact most of the
 
05:39:48.430 --> 05:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
community that I work with uses another
 
05:39:50.590 --> 05:39:50.600 align:start position:0%

concerning possible criminal conduct
 
05:40:10.350 --> 05:40:10.360 align:start position:0%
would increase their sense of safety
 
05:40:12.150 --> 05:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
when coming forward and it would

05:40:32.468 --> 05:40:32.478 align:start position:0%
safe when doing so and be granted
 
05:40:35.468 --> 05:40:35.478 align:start position:0%

05:40:37.628 --> 05:40:37.638 align:start position:0%
trafficking Survivor that wants to talk
 
05:40:39.468 --> 05:40:39.478 align:start position:0%
about her personal experience about
 
05:40:42.150 --> 05:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
trafficking but in doing so would be
 
05:40:45.788 --> 05:40:45.798 align:start position:0%
admitting criminal activities such as
 
05:40:47.750 --> 05:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
prostitution we can all agree that we
 
05:40:50.430 --> 05:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
want to hear real life testimony and
 
05:40:51.990 --> 05:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
that we should not be sending the police
 
05:40:55.390 --> 05:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
after her to make a prostitution arrest
 
05:40:57.390 --> 05:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
similarly a person who wants to talk
 
05:40:59.390 --> 05:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
about their drug addiction struggles in
 
05:41:01.990 --> 05:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
a drug policy hearing perhaps should not
 
05:41:05.390 --> 05:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
be targeted or criminalized
 
05:41:07.708 --> 05:41:07.718 align:start position:0%
afterwards it was here at this state
 
05:41:10.628 --> 05:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
