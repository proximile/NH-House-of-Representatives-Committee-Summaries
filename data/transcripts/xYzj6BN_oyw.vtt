fellow fellow
 
00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:01.019 align:start position:0%
we were both on a Milbank Fellowship
 
00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:05.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
and introduce yourself not that I've
 
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
forgotten but yes good morning Marissa
 
00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:14.060 align:start position:0%
Han associate commissioner at DHS and
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner Weaver sends her regards
 
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
she actually is a Milbank fellow this
 
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
year and they had their first Gathering
 
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
um in Utah presently so she is there but
 
00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:27.899 align:start position:0%
um listening in and um and censor best
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
so and actually before I start there was
 
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:32.220 align:start position:0%
someone else I wanted to introduce or
 
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
perhaps reintroduce and that is Krista
 
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
Morris who's going to wave Krista is our
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
new director of intergovernmental
 
00:11:41.329 --> 00:11:41.339 align:start position:0%
Affairs she started a few weeks ago
 
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
um she is back home in New Hampshire
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
um having previously worked at the
 
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
division for Public Health Services as
 
00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:49.019 align:start position:0%
their legislative liaison and we're very
 
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
lucky to have her back now helping
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
support and work with you all in liaise
 
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
with you all as we advance our our
 
00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
common goals
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
um that relate to Health and Human
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
Services so you'll be seeing more of
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
Krista but just wanted to to welcome her
 
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
which means her business cards aren't
 
00:12:05.449 --> 00:12:05.459 align:start position:0%
ready for district I don't know they're
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
usually probably not quite ready
 
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
it's giving me the Vital Information
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
from my phone sometime before you thank
 
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
you yeah great
 
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
um so I think that okay ahead often
 
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
means that someone else is no longer
 
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
with us no that is not the case and in
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
fact is John here today no John Williams
 
00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:26.579 align:start position:0%
is continuing um this is just to to
 
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
broaden the reach of our um supports
 
00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:31.019 align:start position:0%
Christa's role will
 
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
um be engaging in the work and strategy
 
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
particularly as it relates to
 
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
um the interplay between state and
 
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
federal activities so for example um
 
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
helping us prepare presently for the
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
possibility of a federal shutdown and
 
00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:46.019 align:start position:0%
what that means for HHS what it means
 
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
for the people we serve so it's really
 
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
just working hand in glove with um John
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
Williams as he continues to support all
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
of us in our common state activities so
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
for the record John Williams is at Lake
 
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
Tahoe he says it's for family wedding I
 
00:13:02.329 --> 00:13:02.339 align:start position:0%
think he's out visiting the cartwrights
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
all right it's a bonanza for him great
 
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
great no thank you for um for asking
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
that question and we're grateful for for
 
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:11.700 align:start position:0%
John for his critical ongoing Services
 
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:13:14.569 --> 00:13:14.579 align:start position:0%
um so I believe the topic that you
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to hear a bit about today is an
 
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
update on the Youth Development Center
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
YDC and its closure and rebuild which we
 
00:13:24.889 --> 00:13:24.899 align:start position:0%
did talk about one or two meetings ago
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
um so so I'll be brief and then um
 
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you have
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
but just as a reminder it was during the
 
00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
last legislative session through hb49
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
and sb1 that the department was given
 
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.670 align:start position:0%
and sb1 that the department was given
the

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
um requirement to shut the current YDC
 
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
which is this new new Services Center in
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester and rebuild a facility for up
 
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:48.200 align:start position:0%
to 18 Youth
 
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
and to determine a location for that and
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
to include a variety of other
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
requirements listed in HB 49 we were
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
also given funding to carry out these
 
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
activities and so over the last several
 
00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
months we've brought on an Architecture
 
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
Firm to support the pre-designed design
 
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.430 align:start position:0%
Firm to support the pre-designed design
process

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
we've engaged extensively with the
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
community in ways I'll talk about
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
um and we have completed site selection
 
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.210 align:start position:0%
um and we have completed site selection
so

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:18.839 align:start position:0%
um as part of that and I should note the
 
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
site as as stated I'm sure at the
 
00:14:23.449 --> 00:14:23.459 align:start position:0%
previous meeting the site where the new
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
facility will be located is on the same
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
campus as Hampstead Hospital and
 
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
residential treatment facility which is
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
now under State ownership as of about 16
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
months ago
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
um and so we have begun work on that
 
00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:38.339 align:start position:0%
campus with the Architects planning for
 
00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
this future home-like architecturally
 
00:14:43.129 --> 00:14:43.139 align:start position:0%
secure facility to be moved there so
 
00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:44.839 align:start position:0%
where we find ourselves in the process
 
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
is what we call basically pre-design
 
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
moving into schematic design I've
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
learned a lot of architecture and
 
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.990 align:start position:0%
learned a lot of architecture and
engineering

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
engineering
 
00:14:56.569 --> 00:14:56.579 align:start position:0%
terminology in the last month or so but
 
00:14:57.889 --> 00:14:57.899 align:start position:0%
um fortunately we're really working with
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
the best of the best when it comes to
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
HDR the architecture who are engaging in
 
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
this project they have 30 years of
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
experience building juvenile facilities
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
across the country state of the art
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
architecturally secure but also very
 
00:15:14.449 --> 00:15:14.459 align:start position:0%
appropriate to the therapeutic needs of
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
this complex population them so they
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
have been working to determine all of
 
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
the square footage needs what needs to
 
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
go where to ensure that um that this is
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
a highly secure facility to ensure that
 
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
this is a facility with the programming
 
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
residential clinical
 
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
um components that it needs to to be
 
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
highly successful the next phase is
 
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
called schematic design which is where
 
00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
they get all the fancy Blueprints and
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
design documents prepared all of that is
 
00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:46.019 align:start position:0%
in preparation for the eventual
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
transition into a construction phase for
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
which we'll be doing a competitive
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
procurement for a construction firm that
 
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
bidding will take place next year and
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
then beginning pretty much exactly a
 
00:15:59.810 --> 00:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
year from now is when construction it
 
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
would actually begin and we expect that
 
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
to be about an 18-month period and that
 
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
would prepare us to begin the transition
 
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
of Youth into the new facility in the at
 
00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:13.019 align:start position:0%
the end of 2025. so it's a it's a
 
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
um appropriate but also I'd say
 
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
aggressive timeline
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
um we need it to be in order to spend
 
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
the federal arpa dollars that are
 
00:16:22.129 --> 00:16:22.139 align:start position:0%
dedicated to this effort
 
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
um and we're feeling
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
um grateful the actual I think what has
 
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
transpired since our last meeting is
 
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
that the um Architects HDR have been
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
much more Hands-On in terms of being on
 
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
that Hampstead site
 
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
um neighbors to uh right probably
 
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
basically abetting a representative
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
Pearson's own property and beginning to
 
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
scope out all of the needs how do we
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
design and and build a building that
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
meets and needs but also is highly
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
respectful of um of the land that it
 
00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:55.259 align:start position:0%
sits on of the water of the desires
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
concerns needs of neighbors and
 
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
community members and that is the last
 
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
thing I want to comment on which is the
 
00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
extensive Community consultation that
 
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
has been going on
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
Senator Birdsell has been convening a
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
very active and energized YDC impact
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
commission I think we're on our fifth
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
meeting and that is a group made up of
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
different individuals including
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
ourselves with involvement in this
 
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
project as well as law enforcement State
 
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
Police Hampstead police fire and the
 
00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
goal of that commission is to really
 
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
understand what are the various impacts
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
of this new facility on the surrounding
 
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
community and how do we mitigate any
 
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
negative impacts whether that's traffic
 
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
whether that's concerns about safety or
 
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:43.220 align:start position:0%
or any issues around that the
 
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
architectural design the aesthetic look
 
00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
of it from the street Etc and so that's
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
been a very active group and in addition
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
to that YDC impact commission which is
 
00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
obviously open to the public and it
 
00:17:59.930 --> 00:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
includes a subcommittee on safety we've
 
00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
also had begun a series of community
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
forums in the town of Hampstead
 
00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
um and that's an opportunity for the
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
town to weigh in on what their concerns
 
00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:12.539 align:start position:0%
are what their feedback is those have
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
been Lively as you can imagine but but
 
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
also very helpful for hearing what the
 
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
concerns are what the myths are what the
 
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:23.220 align:start position:0%
areas that we need to hear not
 
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
surprisingly there are folks who have
 
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
concerns they have concerns about what
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
this means um what you know is it
 
00:18:33.169 --> 00:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
possible for youth to run away from the
 
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
the future YDC facility uh the answer to
 
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
that question by the way is an absolute
 
00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:40.820 align:start position:0%
no when it comes to YDC this is a
 
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art facility and just as no
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
youth has ever eloped from sysc in
 
00:18:48.409 --> 00:18:48.419 align:start position:0%
Manchester that will be the case with
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
the future build which is even more
 
00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:51.230 align:start position:0%
the future build which is even more
secure

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
secure
 
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
many of the concerns from our
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
perspective and representative Pearson
 
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
you were at our last meeting so you may
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
have your own Reflections
 
00:18:59.690 --> 00:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
um many of them are coming at an
 
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
interesting time where Hampstead
 
00:19:03.169 --> 00:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
Hospital is going through some Growing
 
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
Pains to accommodate a more acute
 
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
population so again we had this YDC
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
facility entering the campus we have
 
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital and residential
 
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
treatment facility on that campus now
 
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
under State ownership serving a very
 
00:19:18.169 --> 00:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
acute population and there are some
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
challenges that we've faced in terms of
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
even though we have all of the
 
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
appropriate Staffing ratios even though
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
we have strong contract oversight we've
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
had to make some important adjustments
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
to ensure that that facility has the
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
stability that it needs it has required
 
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
some significant partnership with local
 
00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
law enforcement Fire EMS when things
 
00:19:39.529 --> 00:19:39.539 align:start position:0%
have happened
 
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
um we're proud that thanks to many of
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
the changes that have been made in terms
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
of the physical facility locking in
 
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
terms of fences that are going up Etc we
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
really haven't had the issues of Youth
 
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
from the hospital running away that we
 
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
had for a period of about six or so
 
00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
weeks those were all fortunately without
 
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
incident in terms of any consequences we
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
were able to round the kids up and bring
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
them back where they needed to be but we
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
have now basically prevented that from
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
happening again at the hospital and as I
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
said before it will absolutely not
 
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
happen at YDC because of the nature of
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
that facility being so much more secure
 
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
we've also engaged in a number of
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
different leadership changes and
 
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
programmatic inventory of all of our
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
safety strategies to ensure that
 
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital is um is not just
 
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
preventing kids from running away but
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
fundamentally managing very acute
 
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
escalated behaviors within the facility
 
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
appropriately and so
 
00:20:36.409 --> 00:20:36.419 align:start position:0%
um so obviously we have more work to do
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
but we're feeling very optimistic about
 
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
stabilizing what needs to be stabilized
 
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
on the on the hospital campus and I
 
00:20:45.049 --> 00:20:45.059 align:start position:0%
think that in turn will reassure the
 
00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:45.909 align:start position:0%
think that in turn will reassure the
community

00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
of just how important it is for us to be
 
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
good neighbors on this growing campus as
 
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
YDC makes its move there so I will um
 
00:20:57.289 --> 00:20:57.299 align:start position:0%
there was one more thing I wanted to
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
mention and it's escaping me at the
 
00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
moment uh oh I had one more thing which
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
is we've also had the YDC steering
 
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
committee so this is basically a group
 
00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
of people who are working side by side
 
00:21:09.529 --> 00:21:09.539 align:start position:0%
with us as Department of Health and
 
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
Human Services or child advocate Etc to
 
00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
design this physical facility and
 
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson has kindly agreed
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
to serve on that as has the planning
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
town planning board pres um chair
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
um from the town so essentially what
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is bring in as much
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
Town voice and town input into the the
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
both detailed and higher level planning
 
00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
for that facility so that we can ensure
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
that it's collaborative all throughout
 
00:21:39.289 --> 00:21:39.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
my response would be while the meeting
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
was unfolding I was more than impressed
 
00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:48.059 align:start position:0%
with how Senator Birdsall and Associate
 
00:21:48.059 --> 00:21:49.430 align:start position:0%
with how Senator Birdsall and Associate
commissioner

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.010 align:start position:0%
commissioner
and

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
kept the lid on I mean I had 9-1 on my
 
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
phone about ready to push the fund on
 
00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:00.539 align:start position:0%
several times during the meeting I don't
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
know how you did it but um you kept the
 
00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
lid on also I am not an architect but my
 
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
son-in-law is and so we discussed how it
 
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
could be secure without looking like and
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
so that the people involved would feel
 
00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
this is a a comforting welcoming and
 
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
helping facility and the residents who
 
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
all live further away from it than I do
 
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
um would know it's secure and I think
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
the architectural team we have is doing
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
a very good job
 
00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments yes
 
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
um representative Murphy thank you you
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned they were interesting I'm just
 
00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
kind of wondering if you could elaborate
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
on what their major concerns were in the
 
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
um in the Forum sure
 
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
yeah so the um the community Forum
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
concerns I'd say I think we drilled them
 
00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
down to three areas we'll see if I can
 
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
remember I mean the first thing that I
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
and this is not just at this community
 
00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
Forum meeting it was at the prior one we
 
00:23:00.049 --> 00:23:00.059 align:start position:0%
had one at the Hampstead Public Library
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
that was maybe a little less Lively and
 
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
then the one that representative
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
Pearson's describing was held at St
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
Christopher's church
 
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
across the street from the current
 
00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
campus um which uh despite being a uh
 
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
house of worship uh proved to bring
 
00:23:15.409 --> 00:23:15.419 align:start position:0%
about some strong opinions and feelings
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
as well that it was but it was all as uh
 
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson said I think we
 
00:23:21.289 --> 00:23:21.299 align:start position:0%
we managed um and and helped people feel
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
heard so the first thing I mean the
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
first thing we heard is that this is a
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
community that really cares about
 
00:23:27.649 --> 00:23:27.659 align:start position:0%
vulnerable people
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
um because of that there were comments
 
00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
made both about the importance of the
 
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
services delivered by DHHS but also
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
um elderly individuals who live alone at
 
00:23:39.409 --> 00:23:39.419 align:start position:0%
the retirement community across the
 
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
street and kids who are used to having
 
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
you know not locking their doors um on
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
some of the beautiful abutting
 
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
properties and so I think we tried to
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
focus people on how how that same value
 
00:23:51.649 --> 00:23:51.659 align:start position:0%
of supporting families and keeping our
 
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
families safe and supported is embedded
 
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
in in what these um what these DHHS
 
00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
facilities are looking to do so that was
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
the first element second was around
 
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
really land concerns we've heard
 
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
um we have some very expert neighbors
 
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
who have concerns about water who have
 
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
concerns about the uh everything about
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
the Topography of the landscape and the
 
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:13.980 align:start position:0%
snow plows and we have they have sent us
 
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
at times even 17 pages of detailed
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
analysis which has been very helpful
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
because it allows the division for
 
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
Public Works which is our partner at the
 
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services to
 
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
be able to ensure we're checking all the
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
boxes when it comes to engineering
 
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
Solutions when it comes to the various
 
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
assessments and things we have to do and
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
we take that seriously we don't have to
 
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
as a state go through all of the
 
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
approvals that a say private or
 
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
commercial property would but we are
 
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
going to go before the town planning and
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
and so forth to ensure that they're
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
having the input that they need so that
 
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
we show that we're we're developing
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
responsibly so I'd say the first were
 
00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:54.020 align:start position:0%
around kind of land water
 
00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
aesthetic and privacy concerns third was
 
00:24:59.810 --> 00:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
around safety which I think I've talked
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
about just this kind of perception which
 
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
I think we were able to mostly assuage
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
um that kids are going to be running a
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
mock everywhere and and that it's a
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
danger which which we we firmly believe
 
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
it's not but we also have more work to
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
do to be able to stabilize things at the
 
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
hospital to to prove that and then I
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
think the last area of concern was
 
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
around Staffing how are you going to
 
00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
attract the staff to to be at this
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
facility to to work there when you're
 
00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
already having challenges at the current
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital which is a great
 
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
question and point and we have a number
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
of different strategies going on both
 
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
within our human resources team to
 
00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:37.799 align:start position:0%
ensure that we're planning for that but
 
00:25:37.799 --> 00:25:38.810 align:start position:0%
ensure that we're planning for that but
also

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:38.820 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
um I think part of what is proving
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
effective even though some people who
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
work at sysc are interested in kind of
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
making the move many are actually very
 
00:25:48.529 --> 00:25:48.539 align:start position:0%
excited there are going to get to work
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
at a facility that is that is state of
 
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
the art that is a beautiful place to
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
work that is secure and yet any of us
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
would would the amount of light that's
 
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
going to be flowing in the the quality
 
00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:02.940 align:start position:0%
of the um the physical
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
um layout and then the corresponding
 
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
impact that has on the people we serve
 
00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
who are positively impacted by that
 
00:26:12.289 --> 00:26:12.299 align:start position:0%
design is proving to to to be highly
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
engaging to many of the staff who want
 
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
to work in there and who want to move
 
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
over with us so I think you mentioned
 
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
the good neighbors and great neighbors
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
um who including great neighbors dogs
 
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
more importantly who uh who sometimes
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
wander on for our property so um so
 
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
we're feeling optimistic but those and
 
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
we're also trying to to one of the
 
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:31.559 align:start position:0%
things we're emphasizing with the
 
00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:33.059 align:start position:0%
community is how much we're hearing them
 
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
and then the specific adaptations and
 
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
changes we're making based on that
 
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:40.010 align:start position:0%
changes we're making based on that
feedback

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
and if yes follow up just follow up
 
00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that is there a name
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
for this facility or is it are they
 
00:26:48.049 --> 00:26:48.059 align:start position:0%
going to name it separately from the
 
00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital or how is that going
 
00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:51.539 align:start position:0%
to work out yeah that question has come
 
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
up a little bit we haven't figured that
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
out yet um in statute it is referred to
 
00:26:59.390 --> 00:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
um as the Youth Development Center YDC
 
00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
um but uh if anyone has ideas or
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
creative suggestions I believe
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson actually
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
suggested we work with local school
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
children to kind of get their help
 
00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
around design around naming around some
 
00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
of the Aesthetics which I think is kind
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
of a nice idea as well so that we create
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
a sense of not just Community tolerance
 
00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
but Community Pride in this building
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
director Flagship planning on being here
 
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:22.970 align:start position:0%
director Flagship planning on being here
today

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
so children's oversight overlap today
 
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
with HHS oversight
 
00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
so you can talk to Senator Carson about
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
that but um I because of his being on
 
00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:33.059 align:start position:0%
the agenda over there I told him we'd
 
00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
tag team
 
00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.470 align:start position:0%
tag team
okay

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I have some stuff okay anybody else
 
00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
anything else you wish to present nope
 
00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:48.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:51.769 --> 00:27:51.779 align:start position:0%
Media power Youth Organization and
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.970 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
and you can always bring up a third
 
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.890 align:start position:0%
and you can always bring up a third
chair

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:02.900 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
Miss Tilly if you want
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
no I'm good you're good you've got good
 
00:28:12.049 --> 00:28:12.059 align:start position:0%
people working for you yeah okay
 
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:14.220 align:start position:0%
hello thank you for having me my name is
 
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
Heather ingart I am the executive
 
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
director of Media power Youth and uh we
 
00:28:21.409 --> 00:28:21.419 align:start position:0%
are a Youth Development organization
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
dedicated to helping youth build healthy
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
communication skills through media
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
literacy and we have been working in the
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire for over two
 
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
decades we actually started as a
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
community health clinic by a group of
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
Physicians and concerned parents who are
 
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
really looking at the impact of media on
 
00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:40.220 align:start position:0%
the health and well-being of children
 
00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
and we work on a variety of prevention
 
00:28:45.649 --> 00:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
initiatives here with different types of
 
00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
organizations such as the partnership
 
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
for drug free NH and local YMCAs Boys
 
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.390 --> 00:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:00.669 --> 00:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
introduce your neighbor
 
00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
hi there I'm Jenny O Higgins I'm a
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
senior policy analyst for Behavioral
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
Health with DHHS
 
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.590 align:start position:0%
Health with DHHS
good

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
um before I jump in too much I like to
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
spend a little time talking about how we
 
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
define media because we look at it very
 
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
broadly it's a system of communication
 
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
and includes TV
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
um entertainment like video games as
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
also movies as well as tools that our
 
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
youth are using every day in the
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
classroom like Google Classroom where
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
students are using it to complete
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
assignments and talk with their teachers
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
is actually a form of social media and
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
we want to help our kids learn how to
 
00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
navigate these spaces for their academic
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
learning and their success in school and
 
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
out of school
 
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the mission of our
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
organization we do recognize that media
 
00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
can have negative effects but we
 
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
intentionally frame our mission in a
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
very positive way our mission is to
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
inspire young people to engage with
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
media and thoughtful and creative ways
 
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
that support their physical and mental
 
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
well-being and it's always about
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
well-being for us but we want to
 
00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
approach when we introduce ourselves to
 
00:30:09.529 --> 00:30:09.539 align:start position:0%
people to show that this is going to be
 
00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
a start of a conversation and that we're
 
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
not approaching it from a place of
 
00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.389 align:start position:0%
not approaching it from a place of
judgment

00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
judgment
 
00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
we still we have three buckets of
 
00:30:18.769 --> 00:30:18.779 align:start position:0%
service youth programs which I mentioned
 
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
which I'll talk about today family
 
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities that include
 
00:30:25.389 --> 00:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
parent nights at schools and also
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
curricula that we and other resources
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
that we provide to local teachers across
 
00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:34.669 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
when we consider our impact our first
 
00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:39.539 align:start position:0%
goal is to help people understand what
 
00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:42.059 align:start position:0%
is this connection between media and the
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
culture of our community our health and
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
relationships these are protective
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
factors that enable us to be resilient
 
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
in the face of change and we provide
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
opportunities to build communication and
 
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
critical thinking skills as well as to
 
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
understand what are those media habits
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
that contribute to well-being and which
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
ones are not contributing to well-being
 
00:31:03.649 --> 00:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
and we provide resources to a lot of
 
00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
Youth survey organizations just parent
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
guides and curricula
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
we are very fortunate to have a number
 
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
of research partners and that help us in
 
00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:16.980 align:start position:0%
this work we have a long-standing
 
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
relationship with the digital Wellness
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
Lab at Boston Children's Hospital with
 
00:31:21.769 --> 00:31:21.779 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire the
 
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
granite United Way We also more recently
 
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
have been working with the University of
 
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin's Department of Pediatrics on
 
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
a program around teen and Adolescent
 
00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:36.299 align:start position:0%
mental health and that study was
 
00:31:42.049 --> 00:31:42.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
yeah we think about media literacy the
 
00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:46.919 align:start position:0%
foundation of all media literacy is
 
00:31:48.529 --> 00:31:48.539 align:start position:0%
critical thinking skills for youth so
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
what are the skills that they need to
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
make healthy decisions in their lives
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
and so I'm actually slide six that talks
 
00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
about some of these skills and what we
 
00:31:59.210 --> 00:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
hope is in an article like this People
 
00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.769 align:start position:0%
hope is in an article like this People
magazine

00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
magazine
 
00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:03.059 align:start position:0%
um that are used when they are reading
 
00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
this kind of material can recognize this
 
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
is actually an ad from influencers that
 
00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
are tapping into something culturally to
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
show that
 
00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:12.190 align:start position:0%
show that
um

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
to try to make the case that using
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
alcohol would be part of a healthy
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
lifestyle and what media literacy
 
00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
teaches youth is to question this
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
premise and to learn more so they can
 
00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
the role of Youth voice is very
 
00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
important to our organization and we
 
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
have a youth Advisory board that meets
 
00:32:36.169 --> 00:32:36.179 align:start position:0%
monthly that informs the work that we do
 
00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
they share their lived experience and we
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
build programs off of that it actually
 
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
started with a group of New Hampshire
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
students called our youth design team
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
where they worked with us over the
 
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:49.740 align:start position:0%
pandemic to design a curriculum which
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk about and it's their
 
00:32:54.769 --> 00:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
input in developing this resource and it
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
was such a positive experience for our
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
students and they developed something
 
00:33:03.049 --> 00:33:03.059 align:start position:0%
that was pretty significant as you'll
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
see and we decided to continue that
 
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
experience and make our youth Advisory
 
00:33:12.649 --> 00:33:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
um in social media it's really the
 
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that our youth are using
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
to create communities and these are very
 
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:23.220 align:start position:0%
interactive spaces and they are how
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
they're building relationships and right
 
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.269 align:start position:0%
they're building relationships and right
now

00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
um we often see that that's compromising
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
their mental health in a number of
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
different ways we talk about social
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
comparison social rejection fear of
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
missing out these are all aspects of
 
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
social media that our youth are
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
experiencing it which is compromising
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
their mental health
 
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
um however there's also a lot of aspects
 
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
of social media that contribute to
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
well-being in terms of social connection
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
and belonging and so we consider our
 
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
role at Media power youth is teaching
 
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
youth how to balance these things and
 
00:33:59.630 --> 00:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
how can we ensure that the behaviors and
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
habits that they're developing around
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
this part of everyday life is actually
 
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
we have a number of different resources
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
and programs here it's just a sample of
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
all of the programs in our portfolio we
 
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
do have a lot of parent programming that
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
we do including a service called digital
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
Wellness for families where families can
 
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
actually come together and discuss their
 
00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
own values and what type of healthy
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
media habits they want to create at home
 
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
and so our programs are really driven by
 
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
the participants themselves and we
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
deliberately structure them that way
 
00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:38.510 align:start position:0%
deliberately structure them that way
foreign

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:34:40.849 --> 00:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
I did include in the presentation a few
 
00:34:42.649 --> 00:34:42.659 align:start position:0%
pictures of some of our different
 
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
programs that our kids are learning
 
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
through hands-on experience and the
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
research shows that when students are
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
creating media about something that's
 
00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
important to them it causes them to
 
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
really consider what are their own media
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
habits and to use media in ways that are
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
more beneficial for their well-being and
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
an example of our work is during the
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic we worked with Girls Inc and a
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
music video project which is really
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
meant to destigmatize asking for help
 
00:35:17.089 --> 00:35:17.099 align:start position:0%
when you talk with youth a lot of them
 
00:35:20.089 --> 00:35:20.099 align:start position:0%
are concerned not only can they
 
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
sometimes have trouble identifying who a
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
trusted adult is but they don't often
 
00:35:26.089 --> 00:35:26.099 align:start position:0%
many of them don't necessarily believe
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
that if they ask their help they get it
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
and so the purpose of this music video
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
project was to show them that asking for
 
00:35:34.609 --> 00:35:34.619 align:start position:0%
help would be a sign of strength and not
 
00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:36.780 align:start position:0%
a weakness so they could encourage their
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
peers to to seek out help throughout the
 
00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:41.030 align:start position:0%
peers to to seek out help throughout the
pandemic

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:46.390 align:start position:0%
pandemic
foreign

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
programming is also very interactive and
 
00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
we provide opportunities for parents to
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
actually practice talking about media
 
00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
with their kids and so they can develop
 
00:35:58.609 --> 00:35:58.619 align:start position:0%
the language and the vocabulary to
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
better understand what quality screen
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
time looks like and so that they have
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
the tools to address some of these
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
influences at home
 
00:36:10.609 --> 00:36:10.619 align:start position:0%
we do have a wide portfolio that
 
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
teachers here in New Hampshire can
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
utilize to teach these skills they range
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
from fourth grade up through ninth grade
 
00:36:20.089 --> 00:36:20.099 align:start position:0%
we're also working on some lessons for
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
younger grades and they're really based
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
on a unique set of needs based on that
 
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
student's relationship at that life
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
stage and where they are in terms of
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
their adolescent development they're
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
designed to be really flexible so that
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
teachers can use them in a variety of
 
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:36.970 align:start position:0%
teachers can use them in a variety of
settings

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:36.980 align:start position:0%
settings
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
to teach our kids these critical
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
thinking skills that they need
 
00:36:42.599 --> 00:36:44.329 align:start position:0%
thinking skills that they need
yep

00:36:44.329 --> 00:36:44.339 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
um one research that I want to highlight
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
is around our curriculum that was
 
00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
initially called digital EQ and mental
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
health this is the one that was
 
00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
developed by New Hampshire students and
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
it has been renamed by the students and
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
teachers who
 
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
um we piloted this curriculum with as
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
digital climate change and it was all
 
00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
around one single driving question which
 
00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
was what would middle school students
 
00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
need to learn and know in order to build
 
00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
so in this curriculum is a project-based
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
learning module and the students look at
 
00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
how to recognize and build empathy
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
skills in digital spaces and so this is
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
an important tool in school climate
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
initiatives and also really Empower
 
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
students to think about how they're
 
00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
using these tools and how it's affecting
 
00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
their relationships in their lives which
 
00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
you know is a protective Factor they
 
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
learn some foundational skills around
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
emotional intelligence and how to
 
00:37:43.609 --> 00:37:43.619 align:start position:0%
recognize miscommunication how to
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
navigate conflict and then they produce
 
00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
a book a guidebook for their peers at
 
00:37:50.349 --> 00:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
their school on how to use social media
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
positively and this can doesn't
 
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be a public platform
 
00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
like we're not advocating that they
 
00:37:58.849 --> 00:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
teach each other how to use Snapchat
 
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
this can be how do we use Google
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
Classroom a tool we use every day in our
 
00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
school in a positive way
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh Miss India because of the time in the
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
schedule that we have I'm going to now
 
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
call on the committee and Dr Palmer we
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
Grant you permission to speak not vote
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
we're chasing down that but if we have
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
any questions for the presenters
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
while they're preparing that on page 10
 
00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
of your beautiful wonderful handout you
 
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
really know media which is good
 
00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
um the bottom slide number 20 18 states
 
00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
currently have media literacy policies
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
and I S I do not see New Hampshire as
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
one of them is this in the works
 
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
I think we're having a lot of
 
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:49.380 align:start position:0%
conversations to write that right um now
 
00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
about that with the governor's executive
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
order on social media and mental health
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
um while I say that we don't have a
 
00:38:55.619 --> 00:38:56.690 align:start position:0%
um while I say that we don't have a
specific

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:38:59.089 --> 00:38:59.099 align:start position:0%
um legislative policy there's a lot of
 
00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
good work being done um in our schools
 
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
around media literacy and teaching
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
skills both in schools and after school
 
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
scoutings as a result of the curriculum
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
that we've made available we do a lot of
 
00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
teacher training and so I would say
 
00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of activity happening
 
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
although we don't necessarily have a
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
formalized policy around me to let us as
 
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:22.740 align:start position:0%
you evaluate what is going on in numbers
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
of schools different Laboratories of
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
testing this we suspect that there will
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
be a policy initiative forthcoming would
 
00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:35.099 align:start position:0%
that be something the department would
 
00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
come up with or would that be presented
 
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
to a some legislators perhaps for a bill
 
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.730 align:start position:0%
to a some legislators perhaps for a bill
filing

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:42.740 align:start position:0%
filing
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
so I I think this is the partnership
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
where we when the when DHHS came to
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
speak about social media and mental
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
health we're now bringing in Media power
 
00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:53.579 align:start position:0%
to talk more specifically about media
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
literacy and that piece of the education
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
because this is so new really that we're
 
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
continuing to learn and research and
 
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
understand what are the connections
 
00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:04.740 align:start position:0%
between mental wellness and media
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
literacy it's this partnership to try to
 
00:40:08.569 --> 00:40:08.579 align:start position:0%
figure out how we how we do this work
 
00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
together that we're still in and
 
00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
understanding the policies that have
 
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:13.140 align:start position:0%
been passed throughout these other
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
states whether or not they have
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
unintended negative consequences or
 
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
where they're truly helpful in learning
 
00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:20.339 align:start position:0%
from that to frame up what does New
 
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:22.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire need I think already we're
 
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
doing a lot to close gaps from symptoms
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
to treatment for our young people and
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have mental health
 
00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:30.140 align:start position:0%
education social emotional learning
 
00:40:32.569 --> 00:40:32.579 align:start position:0%
access to counselors and social workers
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
in our schools appropriate screening and
 
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
intervention to kind of get on tops to
 
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
get and stay on top of all of the mental
 
00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
health challenges but it's the the
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
complexities between how is social media
 
00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
creating healthy positive connection and
 
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
where is it creating negative impacts
 
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
that we're still learning about New
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a reputation for being
 
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
either first or last in just about
 
00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
everything the Deans would last is
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
obvious the danger with first is we're
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
the ones who are making the mistakes to
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
learn from them so we do have 18 states
 
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
who are doing that for us and I'm sure
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
that with what you're doing in the
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
schools and what you're learning from
 
00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
these 18 states pretty soon we'll have a
 
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
policy that we can be proud of that was
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
a push question
 
00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
um representative King
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
first I'd like to thank you for the
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
report that you gave us in June which
 
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.530 align:start position:0%
report that you gave us in June which
was

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:20.540 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
titled something similar and I can't
 
00:41:25.569 --> 00:41:25.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
our group has actually renamed it
 
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
technology and the impacts on use and
 
00:41:32.329 --> 00:41:32.339 align:start position:0%
you gave us a lot of good data and over
 
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
the summer we've we've gone and done
 
00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:37.740 align:start position:0%
even more research on this and one of
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
the questions back in June was how do we
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
what are the solutions because it's
 
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
always great to bring up a problem and
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
if you don't have any solutions so here
 
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
you come in September and I I see a lot
 
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
of solutions here so thank you for the
 
00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
report in June and the solutions now now
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
my question is
um

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:56.830 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:58.670 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
from what I understand from this report
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
kid kids actually got involved you you
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
did this how did how did you actually do
 
00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.810 align:start position:0%
did this how did how did you actually do
that

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:10.010 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:42:13.609 --> 00:42:13.619 align:start position:0%
um so we had um an application process
 
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
for youth that we sent out for those
 
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
that were
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
um concerned about media use and wanted
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
to provide guidance to adults teachers
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
to build programs that would address
 
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:28.140 align:start position:0%
some of the challenges that they were
 
00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
experiencing and then from that we
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
formed this Advisory Group they were
 
00:42:38.089 --> 00:42:38.099 align:start position:0%
asked certain questions about their
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
current relationship with media and
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
what's really nice to see is that we
 
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
have a pretty wide range of perspectives
 
00:42:47.329 --> 00:42:47.339 align:start position:0%
so some who don't use social media at
 
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
all for various reasons it's impact on
 
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
their mental health and some who are
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
Advocates and creators and so we import
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
we felt it was important to have that
 
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
kind of diversity and we meet monthly in
 
00:42:59.230 --> 00:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
our schedule
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
adapts to kind of what's going on with
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
technology at the time and what their
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
lived experience is
 
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
okay great so it was follow up I'm sorry
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's all right thank you Mr chairman
 
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.670 align:start position:0%
all right so
um

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
and I'll have one other follow-up too if
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
I can would you like to buy a book of
 
00:43:21.839 --> 00:43:23.589 align:start position:0%
I can would you like to buy a book of
six

00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
as long as it's discounted
 
00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.589 align:start position:0%
as long as it's discounted
um

00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
so do you have one single area like a
 
00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
boys and girls club or is it some some
 
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
place where did you go through the
 
00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.410 align:start position:0%
place where did you go through the
schools

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
um we both we work across the state and
 
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
so often um schools will tell us if
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
there has been say a lot of cyber
 
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
bullying and they need help navigating
 
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:47.220 align:start position:0%
and they want to engage their community
 
00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
in that so we have worked with a lot of
 
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
after school programs
 
00:43:52.609 --> 00:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
um some schools we're doing some
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
professional development here in Concord
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
in um in this fall and then we will
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
um so we'll basically work with many
 
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
different types of organizations and we
 
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
always start with what are you seeing
 
00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
what do you need and then how to match a
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
program that's going to address that
 
00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.410 align:start position:0%
program that's going to address that
need

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and my final one yes yes
 
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
I can okay and I may I think you can
 
00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
certainly you may
 
00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.630 align:start position:0%
certainly you may
uh

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:23.700 align:start position:0%
the the all-important one is the parents
 
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
and how are are you seeing parent
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
involvement uh and then how how did you
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
actually reach the parents
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
this is one of the problems that we're
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
seeing in our communities is a lot of
 
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
parents that need this aren't coming
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
forward so how do we actually find the
 
00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
parents I will say this is ongoing
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
because the parents have a lot on their
 
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.589 align:start position:0%
because the parents have a lot on their
plates

00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
plates
 
00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
um and media can be stressful navigating
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
this with our youth so we will
 
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
um there's a couple of different ways
 
00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
that have worked for us so when we do do
 
00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
a presentation we'll often work to
 
00:44:58.809 --> 00:44:58.819 align:start position:0%
provide either
 
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
food or have child care or sometimes we
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
do family presentations so they bring
 
00:45:07.849 --> 00:45:07.859 align:start position:0%
the whole family together to talk about
 
00:45:10.849 --> 00:45:10.859 align:start position:0%
this as part of like an after-school
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
night or an event we've also started to
 
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
do some online
 
00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:17.220 align:start position:0%
um offerings so that parents can log in
 
00:45:20.329 --> 00:45:20.339 align:start position:0%
and do a virtual session from home and
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
we will continue to talk with parents
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:45:28.609 --> 00:45:28.619 align:start position:0%
innovate in in what we can do to try to
 
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
provide these in a flexible way for them
 
00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:32.339 align:start position:0%
we also have a standalone parent guide
 
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
or that will distribute at various
 
00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:37.490 align:start position:0%
or that will distribute at various
um

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
child friendly events we've started to
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
do more festivals and fairs here in New
 
00:45:44.809 --> 00:45:44.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be able to reach parents
 
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
um when they're out in the community and
 
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
to start that conversation
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:53.300 align:start position:0%
and if any further I think
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy you had your hand
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
up yes thank you um and thank you for
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
this work I mean it's it's obvious
 
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
that we see it personally and even you
 
00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
know socially around very serious the
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
importance of social media and its
 
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.230 align:start position:0%
importance of social media and its
impact

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
number one is is it fair to say that the
 
00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
primary mission is not so much the
 
00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
um the the use and the creation and the
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
mechanics of social media like the
 
00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
Hands-On projects but more of a critical
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
eye to its use in its implications and
 
00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
it's an impact on society and kids uh
 
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
number one question number two if the in
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
reference to a Chairman's question on uh
 
00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
slide uh on page 20. if people in other
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
states you know have this in in fact I'm
 
00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
specifically thinking about
 
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts where is this type of
 
00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
policy literacy policy housed for like
 
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
teachers to access it and understand it
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
so let me address the first question on
 
00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
our mission and yes it is the technical
 
00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:56.220 align:start position:0%
skills the current media creation skills
 
00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:57.710 align:start position:0%
skills the current media creation skills
are

00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
um par is more the pathway it's the
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
topic area we know youth are really
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
excited and interested in talking about
 
00:47:05.809 --> 00:47:05.819 align:start position:0%
media and so we harness that passion and
 
00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
interest to talk about this bigger
 
00:47:10.609 --> 00:47:10.619 align:start position:0%
picture so them being critical thinkers
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the information that
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
they're presented with and also to be
 
00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
healthy communicators
 
00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
um can they express their needs to
 
00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
others in a positive way and that
 
00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:23.339 align:start position:0%
translates both offline and also in
 
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
digital spaces and that's the core of
 
00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
what we do the media creation is just
 
00:47:29.569 --> 00:47:29.579 align:start position:0%
the Innovation so that we're really
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
engaging students and we know from how
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
kids learn that that Hands-On component
 
00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:37.079 align:start position:0%
really helps them to understand the
 
00:47:37.079 --> 00:47:38.569 align:start position:0%
really helps them to understand the
material

00:47:38.569 --> 00:47:38.579 align:start position:0%
material
 
00:47:40.609 --> 00:47:40.619 align:start position:0%
so it's the hook that gets them into the
 
00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
programs yes
 
00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
um in terms of your second question
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
um this will in some places
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
um be housed within the Department of
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
Education so it might be credentialing
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
and ensuring and continuing education
 
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
that there is some media literacy
 
00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
training as part of that sometimes it's
 
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
in providing guidance and standards
 
00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
um in other states it's working with the
 
00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
local University system to ensure that
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
as we're training the next generation of
 
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
teachers that media literacy is part of
 
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
that foundational training that prepares
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
them for teaching thank you
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
so just additionally we can email the
 
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
committee the policy report specific to
 
00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
media literacy so you can see what
 
00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
policies have been implemented in these
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
other states in more detail many of
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
which are educational standards around
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
media literacy but some are broader like
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
allowing for mental health days to be
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
excused absences or increase access to
 
00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
counselors and treatment and screening
 
00:48:41.089 --> 00:48:41.099 align:start position:0%
in schools and things like that but
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
there are some that are very specific to
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
media literacy so we can make sure that
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
you all have a copy of the national
 
00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.650 align:start position:0%
you all have a copy of the national
report

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
and I will say that one of the
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
foundations of our organization is that
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
yes we do work a lot with schools but
 
00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
now that we're all walking around with
 
00:48:59.089 --> 00:48:59.099 align:start position:0%
these cell phones is that this is an
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
environment that our children are in 24
 
00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
7 and so looking at um experiential
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
learning in a variety of contexts I
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
think would be really important for the
 
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for your presentation before I
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%

Senator avard hopefully next week to
 
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:49.260 align:start position:0%

are doing the chair suggests to the
 
00:50:57.849 --> 00:50:57.859 align:start position:0%
committee we finally tracked it down
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
that the chairman doesn't make the
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
appointment the committee does at the
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
chair's encouragement and that no one
 
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
else on the subcommittee may be the
 
00:51:12.349 --> 00:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
chair only legislate to us so I had a
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
small group to pick from I asked Senator
 
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:17.220 align:start position:0%
avard if you would be willing to serve
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
to ask the committee for acceptance of
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%

the pie chart the orange and blue pie
 
00:52:14.049 --> 00:52:14.059 align:start position:0%
chart thank you
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's an overview of some of the
 
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
data points that I'll be presenting
 
00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:21.380 align:start position:0%
today the quarterly wait list report
 
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
that I'm reporting for today is the
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
quarter four report for fiscal year 23.
 
00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:29.540 align:start position:0%
so this covers April May and June of
 
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
2023 and in total for the entire fiscal
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
year for the developmental disability
 
00:52:38.089 --> 00:52:38.099 align:start position:0%
waiver we were able to allocate funding
 
00:52:38.099 --> 00:52:39.069 align:start position:0%
waiver we were able to allocate funding
for

00:52:39.069 --> 00:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
1193 people
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
broken down that means that we had 282
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
people aging into Services we had 58
 
00:52:50.329 --> 00:52:50.339 align:start position:0%
people that were new to services and we
 
00:52:50.339 --> 00:52:51.069 align:start position:0%
people that were new to services and we
had

00:52:51.069 --> 00:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
854 people that already received
 
00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
services that were getting additional
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
services that totals 1193.
 
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
of those people that were allocated
 
00:53:05.089 --> 00:53:05.099 align:start position:0%
funding we had 54 people that were able
 
00:53:08.089 --> 00:53:08.099 align:start position:0%
to receive full or partial and this is
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
the pie chart that's in front of you you
 
00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
will see that there were 54 percent that
 
00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
received bull or partial or and 46 that
 
00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
were unable to receive services
 
00:53:20.569 --> 00:53:20.579 align:start position:0%
for the fiscal year
 
00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:26.099 align:start position:0%
so broken down we had 650
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
excuse me 644 people that receive
 
00:53:32.569 --> 00:53:32.579 align:start position:0%
services and 549 Services did not begin
 
00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
for people
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
that was broken down into specific
 
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
reasons that people were unable to start
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
and the top reason was that there was no
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
reason I'm sure you picked up on that
 
00:53:47.809 --> 00:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges when we were
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
pulling this data was that we were
 
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
transitioning from an old system to a
 
00:53:53.569 --> 00:53:53.579 align:start position:0%
new system of reporting so there are
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
many blank spaces and it's very safe to
 
00:53:58.490 --> 00:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
say that the majority of these people
 
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
did not start Services due to an
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
inability for the agency to find a
 
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
provider agency to offer the services or
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
the inability to hire staff to deliver
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
the services within the organization
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
so as you can see um as we go through
 
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
the reasons we had 22 percent that no
 
00:54:19.849 --> 00:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
longer requested services so they
 
00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
changed their mind and decided they
 
00:54:23.569 --> 00:54:23.579 align:start position:0%
didn't want services and then staff and
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
provider Recruitment and selecting an
 
00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:28.140 align:start position:0%
agency were the next two issues that
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
people ran into in starting their
 
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.809 align:start position:0%
people ran into in starting their
services

00:54:32.809 --> 00:54:32.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
so that's the developmental disabilities
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
waiver which is adults with
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities the next
 
00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:40.380 align:start position:0%
waiver is the in-home supports waiver
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
which is for children with developmental
 
00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:43.980 align:start position:0%
disabilities living at home with their
 
00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:45.049 align:start position:0%
disabilities living at home with their
parents

00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:45.059 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
so for the entire fiscal year we were
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
able to allocate funding for 130
 
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
individuals broken down we had 68 people
 
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
that were new to services and 62 people
 
00:54:58.370 --> 00:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
that were already receiving services but
 
00:55:00.049 --> 00:55:00.059 align:start position:0%
getting enhancements
 
00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
of the 130 people 77 were be able to
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
receive full or partial and 23 percent
 
00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.049 --> 00:55:15.059 align:start position:0%
so broken down again we had issues
 
00:55:16.609 --> 00:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
running into staff and provider
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and 13 of them just no
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
so moving on from the In-Home Support
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
waiver onto the acquired brain disorder
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
waiver which serves people with
 
00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
traumatic and brain injury and acquired
 
00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
brain disorder
 
00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
we have lower numbers for this waiver
 
00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
totaling 61 people over the fiscal year
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
that were allocated funding
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
15 of the 61 were new to the services
 
00:55:49.609 --> 00:55:49.619 align:start position:0%
and 46 needed enhanced services
 
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
now out of the 61 that receive funding
 
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
60 of those individuals were slated to
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
begin services within the fiscal year
 
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
so out of those 60 we had 44 that
 
00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
received services and 16 that did not
 
00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
receive services or their services did
 
00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
not begin again challenges around
 
00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
provider Recruitment and for this
 
00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
population we had a number of people
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
that didn't have Medicaid established so
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
we would have to go and work with them
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
around establishing their Medicaid
 
00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.890 align:start position:0%
around establishing their Medicaid
eligibility

00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
are numbers for our three home and
 
00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
community-based Care waivers within the
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
developmental Services System
 
00:56:31.370 --> 00:56:31.380 align:start position:0%
we are working on trying to address the
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
issues around identifying provider
 
00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
agencies and supporting agencies so that
 
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
they can recruit staff to provide the
 
00:56:41.569 --> 00:56:41.579 align:start position:0%
services we do understand that that is
 
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
the biggest challenge across our service
 
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
delivery system
 
00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
how aggressive is your recruitment I
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
know from my day job uh I have openings
 
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
too and I'm just wondering what are you
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
doing more specifically to try to fill
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
so we have a very busy year ahead and we
 
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
just crossed the finish line for our
 
00:57:14.809 --> 00:57:14.819 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan to becoming to
 
00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
become compliant with Federal
 
00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:18.059 align:start position:0%
requirements which everybody is familiar
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
with our BDS scriptive action plan going
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
into the next year we're working hard to
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
develop rates that are based on provider
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
cost and it's Our intention to develop a
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
rate that is going to meet the needs of
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
our provider agencies and also
 
00:57:34.559 --> 00:57:37.150 align:start position:0%
our provider agencies and also
incentivize

00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
incentivize
 
00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
direct support professionals and their
 
00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:42.380 align:start position:0%
professional growth around certification
 
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
and training
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
that is to say you might take in some
 
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
people who are almost there but give
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
them as part of the package the training
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
to get there yes and incentivize
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
providers to do the training for their
 
00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
staff so that they can improve
 
00:57:59.809 --> 00:57:59.819 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention within their
 
00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
organizations good
 
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your continued efforts
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
to interface with the public I know as
 
00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
one who attends the Hampstead meetings
 
00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
about that which is in my backyard
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
um it's difficult dealing with people
 
00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
and their needs which are very personal
 
00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
and very real to them but I I want to
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your continuing efforts to
 
00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
reach out to those folks and thank you
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
for your support as well and that
 
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholder engagement is a strong
 
00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
priority for us going into the next year
 
00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and thank you for
 
00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:46.500 align:start position:0%

00:59:01.370 --> 00:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
and while I'm putting out brush fires
 
00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:09.540 align:start position:0%

just briefly educate you on the purpose
 
00:59:59.630 --> 00:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
and structure of the commission and then
 
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
Rory will get to the good stuff and give
 
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
you the highlights of our work for the
 
01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
past year
 
01:00:08.089 --> 01:00:08.099 align:start position:0%
so the commission was first legislated
 
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:11.220 align:start position:0%
in 2005 and with the purpose of
 
01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
providing confidential protections for
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire hospitals to gather
 
01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:19.740 align:start position:0%
and to review Adverse Events experienced
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
in their facilities
 
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
discuss root cause analyzes and develop
 
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
best practices to improve patient safety
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
the commission was so successful that in
 
01:00:34.849 --> 01:00:34.859 align:start position:0%
2019 it was legislated as a permanent
 
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
commission and in addition to our 26
 
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
acute care hospitals four specialty
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
hospitals in New Hampshire hospital
 
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
Ambulatory Surgery centers were also
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
invited to participate we have a
 
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
designate the commissioner of DHHS that
 
01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
participates as well as up to three
 
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
public members who are really vital as
 
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
they bring the voice of the patient and
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
perspective of the patient to our work
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
we meet five times a year and in
 
01:01:08.809 --> 01:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
addition to reviewing Adverse Events
 
01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:11.540 align:start position:0%
which are required to be reported
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
mandatory in our state and are very
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
clearly defined we also wear the de
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
facto group to examine workplace
 
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
violence events which unfortunately have
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
increased dramatically
 
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
this will change with the passage of
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 459 and 2022
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
workplace violence events will be
 
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
reported to the New Hampshire Health
 
01:01:41.089 --> 01:01:41.099 align:start position:0%
Care workplace safety Commission and on
 
01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
July 1st of 2023
 
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:47.700 align:start position:0%
our commission was renamed to include
 
01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
the patient in it to prevent confusion
 
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
so we are officially New Hampshire
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
Health Care
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
quality and patient safety Commission
 
01:01:58.079 --> 01:02:00.109 align:start position:0%
quality and patient safety Commission
Now

01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
Now
 
01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
so there's four guiding principles that
 
01:02:03.789 --> 01:02:03.799 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
incorporates into their work
 
01:02:09.069 --> 01:02:09.079 align:start position:0%
the first is promoting High reliability
 
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
very critical to ensure that processes
 
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
are standardized and that we have
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
proactive mechanisms to look at
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
potential error before they occur
 
01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
we established just cultures in our
 
01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:26.770 align:start position:0%
we established just cultures in our
organizations

01:02:26.770 --> 01:02:26.780 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
unfortunately ours will occur and it's
 
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
critical that individuals well held
 
01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
accountable are able to feel safe as
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
those events are reported investigated
 
01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:41.540 align:start position:0%
and that we take a systems approach to
 
01:02:44.809 --> 01:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
investigation we adopt evidence-based
 
01:02:47.809 --> 01:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
best practices to improve outcomes so we
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
really are looking at science in
 
01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
developing our processes and Care
 
01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:56.030 align:start position:0%
developing our processes and Care
recommendations

01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
and we're ensuring that Health Equity
 
01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
diversity and inclusion are Forefront we
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
understand and this is where again
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
incorporating the voice of the patient
 
01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:09.260 align:start position:0%
is critical that and covet only
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
emphasized the fact that there are
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
significant Health disparities and
 
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in health care and we need
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
to address those as we go forward
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
I have a question at this juncture as
 
01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
part-time CEO of a small Medical
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
Counseling and massage center in
 
01:03:28.079 --> 01:03:29.770 align:start position:0%
Counseling and massage center in
Kingston

01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:29.780 align:start position:0%
Kingston
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
is a facility like ours or a larger
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
medical facility mandatory reporters if
 
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
so the I'm not asking for a place yeah I
 
01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
wonder if there were and right so
 
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
there's mandatory adverse event
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
reporting for
 
01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:51.299 align:start position:0%
um various entities as a private
 
01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
practice is if I'm understanding
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
correctly you would not have mandatory
 
01:03:58.730 --> 01:03:58.740 align:start position:0%
reporting okay you're talking larger
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
hospitals and other public facilities
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
that is correct thank you please
 
01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
continue you're welcome
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
um at this point I'm going to turn to
 
01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
Rory for some highlights
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
so for 2022-23 uh we had continued a lot
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
of our virtual meetings that we had
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
transitioned to during covid however we
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
had some concerns as the executive
 
01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
committee met that there was not the
 
01:04:24.049 --> 01:04:24.059 align:start position:0%
same level of relationship and
 
01:04:25.849 --> 01:04:25.859 align:start position:0%
interaction that we had had previously
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
so we have made the decision to move our
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
commission meetings back to an in person
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
with a remote option for extenuating
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances only
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
um the attendance at all of our meetings
 
01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
was very high throughout this year with
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
about 35 to 40 members present at each
 
01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.670 align:start position:0%
about 35 to 40 members present at each
meeting

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.530 align:start position:0%
meeting
okay

01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
um at each commission meeting we did do
 
01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
a review and discussion of the most
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
recent Adverse Events data which DHHS
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
has provided for us and that's been very
 
01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
helpful for the commission uh to have a
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
more real-time view of what's Happening
 
01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
across the state we have seen similar to
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
National trends that New Hampshire had
 
01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
an increase in the number of Adverse
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
Events reported as the pandemic slowly
 
01:05:05.809 --> 01:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
began to unwind and through the
 
01:05:07.849 --> 01:05:07.859 align:start position:0%
commission's work we identified some
 
01:05:09.289 --> 01:05:09.299 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortages as a major
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
contributor to those that rise in
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events we had kind of The
 
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
Perfect Storm of high vacancy rates and
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
then the unprecedented use of contracted
 
01:05:20.569 --> 01:05:20.579 align:start position:0%
staff which we refer to often as
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
Travelers which could be nursing Locum
 
01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:27.020 align:start position:0%
providers other clinicians that come in
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
we had some new clinical leaders who may
 
01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
have been inexperienced as leadership
 
01:05:34.849 --> 01:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
that often got pulled into Staffing
 
01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:37.140 align:start position:0%
roles as well and were unable to Mentor
 
01:05:38.569 --> 01:05:38.579 align:start position:0%
some of the new clinicians that were
 
01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
coming through many of those new
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
clinicians that were coming through were
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
during covid so their education looked
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
very different than what we had
 
01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
experienced ourselves coming into the
 
01:05:50.809 --> 01:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
field with a lot of person-to-person
 
01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
connection a lot of these new staff were
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
coming in with more remote or virtual
 
01:05:59.089 --> 01:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
experiences in patient care
 
01:05:59.099 --> 01:05:59.750 align:start position:0%
experiences in patient care
um

01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
so recognizing the challenges of the
 
01:06:03.890 --> 01:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
healthcare environment our commission
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
has been focusing on best practices to
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
proactively identify some of the process
 
01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
failures identify evidence-based tools
 
01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
to assist clinicians and hardwiring all
 
01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
the necessary elements for patient care
 
01:06:17.809 --> 01:06:17.819 align:start position:0%
there is a bit of a Back to Basics theme
 
01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
in the past couple of years in
 
01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
unfortunately seeing some of our trends
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
that had been declining going back up
 
01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
so some of the topics that we've
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
discussed over the past year in terms of
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
quality and safety we had some
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
representatives from the veterans
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
administration of Manchester come and
 
01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
speak about the healthcare failure mode
 
01:06:38.569 --> 01:06:38.579 align:start position:0%
and effects analysis framework to again
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
proactively identify risks in new
 
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
processes through risk assessments
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
identify potential failure points remove
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
system vulnerabilities before the error
 
01:06:48.599 --> 01:06:49.990 align:start position:0%
system vulnerabilities before the error
occurs

01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
occurs
 
01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
we also had education on
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
evidence-based team steps program which
 
01:06:57.890 --> 01:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
is a nationally recognized program to
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
improve communication and teamwork among
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
health care workers to optimize those
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
outcomes for our patients
 
01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
and the the speaker that we had was
 
01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:08.700 align:start position:0%
great in terms of providing us some real
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
things that we could do right away it
 
01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
wasn't necessarily conduct a bunch of
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
meetings and get it off the ground but
 
01:07:15.529 --> 01:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
there are things that we can do right
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
now to change the way we communicate and
 
01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
improve that we had some presentations
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
on new models and strategies to reduce
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
patient falls and reduce Hospital
 
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
acquired pressure injury which continue
 
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
to be the most commonly reported Adverse
 
01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
Events in this state
 
01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
we had some storytelling opportunities
 
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
which are often very powerful related to
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
surgical Adverse Events to identify
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
commonalities and nuances in those
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
events that we've seen we included a
 
01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
review of updated guidelines from the
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
association of operating room nurses or
 
01:07:50.089 --> 01:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
aorn on the use of technology to ensure
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
accurate surgical counts and prevent
 
01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:54.260 align:start position:0%
retained forward objects during surgery
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
and we did do a deep dive into some
 
01:07:59.329 --> 01:07:59.339 align:start position:0%
one-off Adverse Events we have the
 
01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
commonly reported Falls and Hospital
 
01:08:02.569 --> 01:08:02.579 align:start position:0%
acquired pressure injuries but we did
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
see some Adverse Events that we don't
 
01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
typically see so we wanted to talk about
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
what was going on with those what we
 
01:08:11.569 --> 01:08:11.579 align:start position:0%
were seeing we have seen a surprising
 
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
increase in increasing trend of sexual
 
01:08:17.689 --> 01:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
assaults that are reported so by sharing
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
the details of these events and the
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
analyzes and Improvement opportunities
 
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
our members were able to share some
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
valuable insights and tools to assist
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues in preventing some of these
 
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:28.140 align:start position:0%
similar events from happening in their
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
own organizations and again movie into
 
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
um for patient and family engagement we
 
01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
had a member presentation uh from a
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
hospital that obtains real-time feedback
 
01:08:43.249 --> 01:08:43.259 align:start position:0%
from their patients through a volunteer
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
rounding program where volunteers will
 
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
actually go and talk to the patients
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
while they're in the hospital and
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
solicit feedback from them oftentimes
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
we're relying on surveys that occur
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
weeks or months after the patient has
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
left the facility where their memories
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
may be a little bit
 
01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:00.590 align:start position:0%
may be a little bit
um

01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:02.809 --> 01:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
not skewed or
 
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
um just affected by the time but getting
 
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
that real-time feedback these um the
 
01:09:10.249 --> 01:09:10.259 align:start position:0%
volunteers were able to take some
 
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
real-time improvements in the Care and
 
01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
Share some feedback with the staff
 
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
they did something they gave some
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
examples of their service recovery and
 
01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
the care improvements and that was very
 
01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:20.630 align:start position:0%
the care improvements and that was very
powerful

01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
powerful
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
we were educated on a new model called
 
01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
experience based co-design to engage two
 
01:09:27.650 --> 01:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
groups in information gathering and
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
partnering for problem identification
 
01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
and problem solving
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
from this we learned some new ways that
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
we could engage our patients and staff
 
01:09:39.169 --> 01:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
to work together improving care for
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
patients with for example substance use
 
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
disorder it might not be something where
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
you want to pull a team in together but
 
01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
to be able to interview them separately
 
01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:48.900 align:start position:0%
get their experiences and bring those
 
01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:50.930 align:start position:0%
get their experiences and bring those
together

01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
they that this process has also been
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
used to improve the check-in process and
 
01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
physician practices increase patient
 
01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
Mobility during hospitalization so a
 
01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
great new way to get us thinking and
 
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
involving the patient in our process
 
01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
improvements uh we've been very
 
01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have Dr Ben Shan as a
 
01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
regular guest at our uh actually a
 
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
member of our commission so he gives us
 
01:10:14.150 --> 01:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
he's looking for things to do until the
 
01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
next week
 
01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
but we've been keeping him busy uh so he
 
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
provides us every meeting and update on
 
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
public health which thankfully we are
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
still continuing to talk about covid-19
 
01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
but we're moving into other things that
 
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
are affecting the health of the state
 
01:10:31.570 --> 01:10:31.580 align:start position:0%
including an emerging infection Trends
 
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
and the members have that opportunity to
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
speak with him directly ask questions
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
about what's coming down the pike we can
 
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
share our challenges and provide
 
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
suggestions on how Public Health can
 
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
better support our work so that's been a
 
01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
really valuable aspect of our meetings
 
01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
so we've acknowledged that supporting
 
01:10:51.169 --> 01:10:51.179 align:start position:0%
that Healthcare Workforce as I mentioned
 
01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
earlier has been critical in rebuilding
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
our quality and safety programs in our
 
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
organizations we've made it a priority
 
01:11:00.169 --> 01:11:00.179 align:start position:0%
to share strategies on how to do that
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
and that is ongoing
 
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
um we've talked about developing roles
 
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
for non-traditional members to
 
01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
incorporate to the healthcare team how
 
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
can we leverage artificial intelligence
 
01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
technology to Aid our clinicians The
 
01:11:16.330 --> 01:11:16.340 align:start position:0%
crucial role of visitors and volunteers
 
01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
some of those people that we
 
01:11:22.189 --> 01:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately lost during the pandemic
 
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
when we shut our doors to both visitors
 
01:11:25.970 --> 01:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
and volunteers we're now bringing them
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
back and really embracing what they can
 
01:11:30.890 --> 01:11:30.900 align:start position:0%
do to assist us in our efforts and
 
01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:32.460 align:start position:0%
creating that culture of continuous
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
Improvement through ongoing data
 
01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
collection transparency and
 
01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:37.430 align:start position:0%
collection transparency and
accountability

01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
so as we enter our 19th year we had our
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
first meeting in August we remain
 
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
grateful to the legislature for this
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
unique organization a lot of us at least
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
I do myself refer to it as my my own
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
peer support network having people
 
01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
across the state who are in similar
 
01:11:57.290 --> 01:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
positions to myself to share some of our
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
challenges some of our celebrations and
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
really take advantage of that Network
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
um we're going to be needing to move to
 
01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
questions in just a minute or two so I
 
01:12:10.729 --> 01:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
believe that was the end you're all good
 
01:12:10.739 --> 01:12:11.470 align:start position:0%
believe that was the end you're all good
um

01:12:11.470 --> 01:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
when someone in one of the public
 
01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.189 align:start position:0%
when someone in one of the public
facilities

01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
um uh the the facility being a mandatory
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
reporter do things have to Channel
 
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
Through the individual of that facility
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
whose job is among other things to
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
report or can anybody report I'm looking
 
01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:33.179 align:start position:0%
at whistleblower if they perceive
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
reporting was not done that should have
 
01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:35.750 align:start position:0%
reporting was not done that should have
been

01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:12:37.729 --> 01:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
how has that happened or maybe it's
 
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you had experience with
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
that I well there's there's a formal
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
process for the hospital to report an
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
adverse event but and I know there's
 
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
some folks in the room that actually
 
01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
patients can call and do call directly
 
01:12:58.850 --> 01:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
to Department of Health and Human
 
01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
Services if there is a health care
 
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
concern they report concerns sometimes
 
01:13:05.930 --> 01:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire Hospital
 
01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
Association who then takes that
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
information back to the originating
 
01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.610 align:start position:0%
information back to the originating
organization

01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:16.140 align:start position:0%
um so an individual organization may
 
01:13:18.010 --> 01:13:18.020 align:start position:0%
have reported it but not everybody
 
01:13:20.689 --> 01:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
involved me know that so there may be
 
01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
somebody saying I don't know what's
 
01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
going on but I'd like them to and they
 
01:13:27.229 --> 01:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
discover oh it's already underway that's
 
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
that could be that's a possibility for
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
sure because you now have the word
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
patient in your title so is it it sounds
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
like it's possible that a patient may
 
01:13:41.090 --> 01:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
directly report
 
01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:43.140 align:start position:0%
so I you know I've certainly had that
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
situation where DHHS has called me and
 
01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
said we have received a concern from a
 
01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
patient or from a patient's family
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
member quite often we do have uh 15
 
01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
business days in order to report that
 
01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes we're within that 15-day
 
01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
window and yes I'm already aware of it
 
01:13:58.850 --> 01:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
I'm submitting it to you so we have
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
those conversations with DHHS but
 
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
certainly if they shared something with
 
01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
us that we were not aware of we would
 
01:14:06.169 --> 01:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
then go and investigate that the patient
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
would not know of your specific
 
01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
organization or how to contact it but
 
01:14:12.410 --> 01:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
they would probably assume DHHS sounds
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
like a good place to go
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
yes well we have that on our all of our
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
websites all of our patients can report
 
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
their concerns sounds like it's working
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr chair uh and thank
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
you for your report
 
01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.110 align:start position:0%
you for your report
um

01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:29.580 align:start position:0%
the essential events on on page nine
 
01:14:31.729 --> 01:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
that chart really was flatlined for
 
01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:33.780 align:start position:0%
about a decade and then obviously it
 
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
spiked in covert
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
does your real-time data currently show
 
01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
it has gone down in the past year or so
 
01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
no it has not gone down so where we have
 
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
two quarters worth of data uh for 2023
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
that we're currently analyzing in the
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
quality commission and our pressure
 
01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
injuries continue to rise which is very
 
01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:07.140 align:start position:0%
concerning and we're going to take a
 
01:15:09.530 --> 01:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
deep dive on that on our October 6th
 
01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:11.090 align:start position:0%
deep dive on that on our October 6th
meeting

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:15:15.729 --> 01:15:15.739 align:start position:0%
um and are other ones uh are are holding
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
stable but the pressure injuries is an
 
01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
area that we're concerned about thank
 
01:15:23.209 --> 01:15:23.219 align:start position:0%
you in the follow-up follow-up
 
01:15:23.219 --> 01:15:25.010 align:start position:0%
you in the follow-up follow-up
and

01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
so you alluded to this so I'm trying to
 
01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
think about the root causes and I'm sure
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
you're looking at it was it specifically
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
you think a the number of the actual
 
01:15:35.689 --> 01:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
physical number of care providers that
 
01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
were present to take care of the surge
 
01:15:40.729 --> 01:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
or it was at the skill set that was the
 
01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
problem in taking care of the Surge and
 
01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
if so are some of the thoughts going
 
01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
forward a change in the um the models of
 
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
care that you know you mentioned
 
01:15:54.169 --> 01:15:54.179 align:start position:0%
visitors and Volunteers in working up to
 
01:15:55.729 --> 01:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
your you know your license you know your
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
skill level and stuff like that so we're
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
we're as a focus is it hiring more
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
people or is it basically are we going
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
to be looking at a different care model
 
01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
going forward you think
 
01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
would say yes both okay
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
um you know the first key is actually
 
01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
getting people to fill our vacancies and
 
01:16:13.729 --> 01:16:13.739 align:start position:0%
that's I think a priority but then once
 
01:16:15.649 --> 01:16:15.659 align:start position:0%
those people are on board we need to
 
01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
look at how we're providing that care is
 
01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
there a way that we can do it more
 
01:16:21.050 --> 01:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
effectively more efficiently and give
 
01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:29.689 --> 01:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
you know at DH the biggest problem right
 
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
now is housing you just can't find
 
01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
anybody is that the major problem that
 
01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
you see as far as hiring people or is it
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
pay levels or how can legislation in any
 
01:16:39.530 --> 01:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
way help you to improve the the
 
01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
vacancies that you have
 
01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
so housing definitely is an issue
 
01:16:47.630 --> 01:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
um and I know many hospitals have gotten
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
very creative in trying to uh find and
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
make housing available for staff
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
um the stress of the of the workplace is
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
very high it's very high stress
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
environment there's high levels of
 
01:17:06.649 --> 01:17:06.659 align:start position:0%
burnout unfortunately with our
 
01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
clinicians and our providers
 
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
so anything that we can do we're very
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
excited about the new workplace safety
 
01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:17.460 align:start position:0%
commission as we feel that's really
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
going to bring a lot of attention and
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
focus to that issue and solution
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
um so anything that we can do to support
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
that because we need to make these
 
01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
workplaces a safe place and a place
 
01:17:33.169 --> 01:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
where people want to be and
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's that's been a very
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
difficult environment and I would say
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
that we are seeing some stabilization in
 
01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
terms of we've at least in my own
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
organization where I work we've had a
 
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:45.300 align:start position:0%
lot of people who work contract staff
 
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
travel staff who are now flipping too
 
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
permanent they're choosing to stay so I
 
01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
think the appeal of travel has worn off
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit and we're also approaching
 
01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
how we're bringing on new staff and
 
01:17:57.530 --> 01:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
providing them a high quality
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
orientation to what we do and how we do
 
01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
it in terms of your burnout one of the
 
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
things I've instituted in the
 
01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
organization I'm part-time CEO of is
 
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
PTSD debriefing I watch my staff I see
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
not only the circumstances that may make
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
it possible for this to happen but also
 
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
indicators in the individual
 
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
suggesting this to another branch of our
 
01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
government as something they would
 
01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:23.830 align:start position:0%
government as something they would
Implement

01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
Implement
 
01:18:28.930 --> 01:18:28.940 align:start position:0%
one cause of burnout is the the need for
 
01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
review with people who have been the
 
01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
professional in a series of adverse
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances are you doing anything
 
01:18:38.689 --> 01:18:38.699 align:start position:0%
like that now and will you if not will
 
01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:41.060 align:start position:0%
you start it on Monday
 
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
what I I can tell you and I'm really
 
01:18:47.290 --> 01:18:47.300 align:start position:0%
proud of this is for the past six months
 
01:18:49.729 --> 01:18:49.739 align:start position:0%
we've convened our New Hampshire
 
01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
hospitals in a clinical peer support
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
learning collaborative
 
01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
and we for the sole purpose of talking
 
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
about not just in an adverse event it is
 
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
critical in an adverse event that we
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
support our clinicians and we're talking
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
providers plus certainly nurses and
 
01:19:11.209 --> 01:19:11.219 align:start position:0%
others who need this support but it just
 
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
in times of high stress so what can we
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
do to develop those programs within our
 
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
institutions what training do people
 
01:19:23.209 --> 01:19:23.219 align:start position:0%
need to be clinical peer supporters so
 
01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
there's been a real uptick in momentum
 
01:19:28.970 --> 01:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
on that and we're at the point of
 
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
increasing training now so that
 
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
hospitals can develop those programs
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
formally and informally I'm familiar
 
01:19:39.169 --> 01:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
with how the fire surface does this and
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
has done this for years and very well
 
01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
but could you shoot me a memo some point
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
on how you're developing it because it
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
will it will help in the particular
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
group that I am hoping to initiate this
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
with absolutely any further questions
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
that representative Palmer
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh my question is coming from
 
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
the having been on peer review for years
 
01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
and the work that obviously you've been
 
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
doing is like where we've all wanted to
 
01:20:09.410 --> 01:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
to head
 
01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
um both from the point of view of of not
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
just blaming people for things but but
 
01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
also enabling patients and the and the
 
01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
custodian to be able to bring things to
 
01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.370 align:start position:0%
custodian to be able to bring things to
forward

01:20:22.370 --> 01:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
one of the things we've been talking
 
01:20:26.209 --> 01:20:26.219 align:start position:0%
about recently is the fact that the rate
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
of change of various things in working
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
in a in an institution
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
really gets ahead and so there's there's
 
01:20:36.410 --> 01:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
always a new thing that you're having to
 
01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
learn and what I find now is maybe it's
 
01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
because I'm getting old is that I'll be
 
01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
thinking I should be learning something
 
01:20:44.450 --> 01:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
more about the actual job I do but now
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to learn something more about
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
fire extinguishers or
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
um you know a new system for doing
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
something related to the EMR and do you
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
look at that kind of
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
issue as something that needs to be
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
looked at in other words
 
01:21:02.689 --> 01:21:02.699 align:start position:0%
it's great to come up with a new program
 
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
that's going to work better than the
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
last one but it's a new program and now
 
01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
everybody has to adapt to it and how
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
does that affect
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
the job I would say I I think we've all
 
01:21:15.410 --> 01:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
experienced that um I don't know that
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
we've talked about that specifically as
 
01:21:18.649 --> 01:21:18.659 align:start position:0%
a group but I think that that's a great
 
01:21:20.689 --> 01:21:20.699 align:start position:0%
point to bring forward that we're aware
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
that we just add and add an ad
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
um but looking at
 
01:21:28.010 --> 01:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
when you add it all together what your
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
actual job is and the time that we have
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
to do it I think that contributes to the
 
01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:33.719 align:start position:0%
level of burnout overwhelm
 
01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
um and the challenges and getting our
 
01:21:36.410 --> 01:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
jobs done so I think that that's
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
something we can certainly bring back to
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
the commission as a discussion point so
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else before you leave
 
01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards and I have
 
01:21:48.169 --> 01:21:48.179 align:start position:0%
decided to learn BSL which is Bureau
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
speak as a second language and having
 
01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:54.300 align:start position:0%

the minutes
 
01:22:12.770 --> 01:22:12.780 align:start position:0%
um it is not the responsibility of an
 
01:22:14.810 --> 01:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
individual member
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
to get his or her replacement that is
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
not that person's job it goes first to
 
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
me and then to the speaker's office who
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%

Edwards is laid up from foot surgery
 
01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald called me others
 
01:22:45.850 --> 01:22:45.860 align:start position:0%
did not and I've been working the phones
 
01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
as you have seen to try to do that so
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
please if you can't be here let me know
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
as soon as you know that I have two
 
01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
alternates but when I've got the
 
01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
alternates into the full-time slot and I
 
01:23:01.729 --> 01:23:01.739 align:start position:0%
still don't have a quorum
 
01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
I have to
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
do a lot of work in real time so just
 
01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
for the minutes and going forward
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%

01:23:26.649 --> 01:23:26.659 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is
 
01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
supervisor at Health Facilities
 
01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
Administration certification unit
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Doreen Shockley
 
01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
I am the manager at the Bureau of
 
01:23:44.450 --> 01:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
Licensing and certification at the
 
01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
department and we're happy to report to
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
you today
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
so I'm here to present a 2022 adverse
 
01:23:52.250 --> 01:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
event reports so first and foremost it
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
is important to remember that consumers
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
should not compare the quality of care
 
01:23:57.290 --> 01:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
and safety of the facilities but a
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
number of types of Adverse Events
 
01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
reported consumers need to look at all
 
01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
factors such as the size of the facility
 
01:24:06.410 --> 01:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
scope and complexity of services offered
 
01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
the number of services performed at the
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
facilities as well New Hampshire
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals contain to face challenges
 
01:24:17.209 --> 01:24:17.219 align:start position:0%
during this covid-19 endemic I mean
 
01:24:18.169 --> 01:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
you've heard from the previous
 
01:24:18.179 --> 01:24:20.050 align:start position:0%
you've heard from the previous
presentation

01:24:20.050 --> 01:24:20.060 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
for our Adverse Events report we utilize
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
the National Quality Forum adverse event
 
01:24:27.649 --> 01:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
list as a basis for the state mandatory
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
adverse event Reporting System there has
 
01:24:31.970 --> 01:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
not been any recent updates to that
 
01:24:35.209 --> 01:24:35.219 align:start position:0%
guide guidelines and in 2022 we have
 
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
seen an increase of Adverse Events
 
01:24:39.530 --> 01:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
reported compared to previous years with
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
a total of 118 Adverse Events reported
 
01:24:46.610 --> 01:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
for for 2022 I did have a report I just
 
01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
want to make sure you upgrade
 
01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
before you move on you are seeing an
 
01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
increase in adverse reports is that
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
because there are more adverse reports
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
or better reporting
 
01:25:02.570 --> 01:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
um at this time it's more Adverse Events
 
01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:07.130 align:start position:0%
um at this time it's more Adverse Events
report

01:25:07.130 --> 01:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:11.450 --> 01:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
um there are top there's top three
 
01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
adverse event categories that was
 
01:25:15.239 --> 01:25:16.310 align:start position:0%
adverse event categories that was
reported

01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
reported
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
um that continues to be reported
 
01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:19.490 align:start position:0%
um that continues to be reported
um

01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
which is surgical events Care events
 
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
relate to pressure injuries and Care
 
01:25:25.610 --> 01:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
events related to Falls so pressure
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
injuries virtual 41 this year which is
 
01:25:32.630 --> 01:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
found on page six Falls were 40 which is
 
01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
found on page seven and surgical events
 
01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
um are 14 which is found on page eight
 
01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
concerning that these event types
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
represent about 81 percent of the total
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
reportable events we continue to focus
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
our efforts on these and address what
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire hospital and
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
ambulatory surgical centers are doing in
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
these areas to improve which is found on
 
01:25:57.290 --> 01:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
page six to nine our department does
 
01:25:59.930 --> 01:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
conduct 10 sample audits quarterly for
 
01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:00.910 align:start position:0%
conduct 10 sample audits quarterly for
the

01:26:00.910 --> 01:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
2022 calendar year and adverse event
 
01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
reports selected were in random for this
 
01:26:09.169 --> 01:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
audit taking into consideration the
 
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
sample would include the most reported
 
01:26:12.770 --> 01:26:12.780 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events and the least reported
 
01:26:16.689 --> 01:26:16.699 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events and our department
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
concluded that the New Hampshire
 
01:26:20.689 --> 01:26:20.699 align:start position:0%
hospitals and numbers are ambulatory
 
01:26:22.129 --> 01:26:22.139 align:start position:0%
surgical centers follow through with
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
their corrective action plans to address
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
and correct the problems identified
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
through their root cause analysis
 
01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.750 align:start position:0%
through their root cause analysis
reports

01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
reports
 
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much do you have any questions
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
anybody this thus far any questions thus
 
01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
far representative Murphy oh thank you I
 
01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
was reading the reporting just a simple
 
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
question I believe why is it that New
 
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital is not required to
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
report the Adverse Events
 
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
why are they accept it out the New
 
01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.290 align:start position:0%
why are they accept it out the New
Hampshire

01:26:50.290 --> 01:26:50.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
except it says you know I'll have to
 
01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
report seriously except for New
 
01:26:57.530 --> 01:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital so I will confirm
 
01:26:59.890 --> 01:26:59.900 align:start position:0%
that but um our law
 
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
exempts state-owned and operated
 
01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
facilities from a lot of the
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
requirements and regulations
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
um and I think like we don't do
 
01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
inspections at state-owned
 
01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
um that might be because we're also
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
state employees and that's a conflict
 
01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
they have accrediting agencies that do
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
the work that we do but I will confirm
 
01:27:19.629 --> 01:27:19.639 align:start position:0%
that that's my
 
01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
guessn from the hospital Association who
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
I've not yet been able to get to speak
 
01:27:26.810 --> 01:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
today of nodded affirmatively that's
 
01:27:29.689 --> 01:27:29.699 align:start position:0%
correct thank you Paula so that that's
 
01:27:31.729 --> 01:27:31.739 align:start position:0%
why Hampstead Hospital does report but
 
01:27:34.129 --> 01:27:34.139 align:start position:0%
the US Hospital does not well Hampstead
 
01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
historically has but Hampstead going
 
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
forward will not will not okay thank you
 
01:27:44.330 --> 01:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
anyone else questions thus far in the
 
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
report and seeing none please continue
 
01:27:52.930 --> 01:27:52.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
I mean you want to save five minutes for
 
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
next time you come because you're really
 
01:27:58.970 --> 01:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
short here yes last time we actually
 
01:28:01.129 --> 01:28:01.139 align:start position:0%
used an additional 10 minutes remember
 
01:28:05.090 --> 01:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
no so we're even now no I don't but
 
01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any other questions
 
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
yes representative Murphy to the rescue
 
01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um the the number of
 
01:28:13.970 --> 01:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
total was 118 is that up because of
 
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
covid or is that up actually as a number
 
01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
relative to where we were in 2019
 
01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
um and the reason I asked that question
 
01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
80 out of the 118 are really
 
01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
um bedside in a sense you know care
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
problems in is that just related to
 
01:28:33.770 --> 01:28:33.780 align:start position:0%
Staffing and the inability to take care
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
of roll a patient get a patient out of
 
01:28:38.090 --> 01:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
bed safely that sort of thing
 
01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
um yes it's definitely Staffing
 
01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
challenges has definitely affected
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
patient care and that's why you see you
 
01:28:47.209 --> 01:28:47.219 align:start position:0%
know the increase of the pressure
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
injuries the increase of the falls and
 
01:28:51.169 --> 01:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
if you really look at the numbers it's
 
01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%
really more bedside you know with the
 
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
Travelers consistencies definitely you
 
01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:57.290 align:start position:0%
Travelers consistencies definitely you
know

01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
um kind of a problem and even right now
 
01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
it's kind of still we're still trying to
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
I mean you have your hospital so it's
 
01:29:04.729 --> 01:29:04.739 align:start position:0%
trying to kind of still recover and work
 
01:29:06.890 --> 01:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
on a better consistency with their
 
01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
Staffing so they can provide more
 
01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
consistent patient care and we do see a
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
lot of sicker patients that means their
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
the hospitalizations our
 
01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:18.780 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations are prolonged so
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
they're in the hospitals more in their
 
01:29:24.110 --> 01:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
risk of getting this pressure injuries
 
01:29:25.850 --> 01:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
and risk for their Falls has increased
 
01:29:28.669 --> 01:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:32.930 --> 01:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
is there a mechanism whereby you look at
 
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
the number of incidences in a certain
 
01:29:39.070 --> 01:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
category as a function of total patient
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
census because if your census is high
 
01:29:45.229 --> 01:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to have more but if we
 
01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
don't know the census is high that data
 
01:29:50.090 --> 01:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
may not tell us whether things have
 
01:29:51.770 --> 01:29:51.780 align:start position:0%
gotten worse
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
or it's just there's more so is there a
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
way to analyze data in that yeah we
 
01:29:58.610 --> 01:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
don't really track like the census on
 
01:30:00.169 --> 01:30:00.179 align:start position:0%
the hospital that's why when I mentioned
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
earlier like when we when you look at my
 
01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
report you have to also consider like
 
01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
where the hospitals are like the scope
 
01:30:08.930 --> 01:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
severity that they uh services that they
 
01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
offer the facility like how big the
 
01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
facility is
 
01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
um we really track like that they're
 
01:30:16.970 --> 01:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
reporting Adverse Events that they're
 
01:30:18.649 --> 01:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
actually doing their root cause analysis
 
01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
to address those concerns and come up
 
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
with a corrective action plan
 
01:30:25.970 --> 01:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
so I don't really we I do work closely
 
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire hospital team
 
01:30:30.110 --> 01:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
commission um just to kind of make sure
 
01:30:31.850 --> 01:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
like they're aware of this and this is
 
01:30:33.410 --> 01:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
like the numbers are high and not
 
01:30:35.570 --> 01:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
they're at least working collaboratively
 
01:30:38.330 --> 01:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
to kind of work on looking at you know
 
01:30:40.250 --> 01:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
what what are the big issues what are
 
01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:41.390 align:start position:0%
what what are the big issues what are
the

01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
things that they could do better work on
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
or kind of
 
01:30:49.850 --> 01:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
find more better newer
 
01:30:52.129 --> 01:30:52.139 align:start position:0%
interventions I guess and sure
 
01:30:56.090 --> 01:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:58.610 --> 01:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
come on up to a microphone near you you
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
can come up to the big people's table or
 
01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
the big people stable
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
either one
 
01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
see the senator gets to pick them up I
 
01:31:09.770 --> 01:31:09.780 align:start position:0%
don't know if I should sit
 
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
um so Chris Herring uh vice president
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
for quality improvement and at the
 
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
foundation healthy communities and
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
administrator for the New Hampshire
 
01:31:23.810 --> 01:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
Healthcare quality and patient safety
 
01:31:26.689 --> 01:31:26.699 align:start position:0%
commission thank you so much
 
01:31:29.209 --> 01:31:29.219 align:start position:0%
um chairman Pearson for asking about
 
01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
census and that was just something that
 
01:31:34.209 --> 01:31:34.219 align:start position:0%
I wanted this commission to understand
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
is that at the end of 2020 and through
 
01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
the first three quarters of 2021
 
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
hospital inpatient census was down
 
01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:47.400 align:start position:0%
significantly if you can recall those
 
01:31:50.530 --> 01:31:50.540 align:start position:0%
dark days of covid we had stopped
 
01:31:52.930 --> 01:31:52.940 align:start position:0%
elective surgeries
 
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
there were patients that we expected
 
01:31:58.250 --> 01:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
influx obviously those patients that
 
01:31:59.689 --> 01:31:59.699 align:start position:0%
were critically ill were were in the
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
hospital otherwise patients were staying
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
away and a lot of them deferred Health
 
01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
Care during that time so while our
 
01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events during those those years
 
01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
that period of time are down our patient
 
01:32:17.169 --> 01:32:17.179 align:start position:0%
inpatient days were down significantly
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the end of 2021 and throughout 2022
 
01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:23.780 align:start position:0%
the exact opposite
 
01:32:26.930 --> 01:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
inpatient days at an all-time high
 
01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
Hospital capacity at approximately 98
 
01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:32.890 align:start position:0%
Hospital capacity at approximately 98
percent

01:32:32.890 --> 01:32:32.900 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:32:35.810 --> 01:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
hospitals at capacity or above capacity
 
01:32:38.810 --> 01:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
and many instances so patient days
 
01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:40.370 align:start position:0%
and many instances so patient days
higher

01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
higher
 
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events also have been higher so
 
01:32:47.090 --> 01:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
if there could be some mechanism it
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
could be data for those scientifically
 
01:32:52.729 --> 01:32:52.739 align:start position:0%
minded or narrative for Liberal Arts
 
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
kids like me it would avoid the shock I
 
01:32:57.410 --> 01:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
don't mind the Shockley but I do mind
 
01:33:00.890 --> 01:33:00.900 align:start position:0%
the shock sorry value of seeing a spike
 
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
in numbers without a narrative
 
01:33:04.850 --> 01:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
explaining what is going wrong with our
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals nothing they're morbids are
 
01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
filled that would be helpful in some way
 
01:33:11.930 --> 01:33:11.940 align:start position:0%
of reporting going forward thank you
 
01:33:13.970 --> 01:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
because I want to make you guys look as
 
01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
good as you are
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and there are mechanisms in
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
some places where we report for example
 
01:33:22.669 --> 01:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
um there's ndnqi it's a national
 
01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
database for nursing quality indicators
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
and in reporting those nursing nursing
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
quality measures there is a denominator
 
01:33:34.189 --> 01:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
that includes
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
patient days or a number of encounters
 
01:33:39.770 --> 01:33:39.780 align:start position:0%
or whatnot so that you can do that
 
01:33:43.129 --> 01:33:43.139 align:start position:0%
comparison but we don't have that but
 
01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for that for that
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation you're welcome
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for your report
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
and before we come to the next uh people
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%

were chatting about something totally
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
unrelated he said could I be in some way
 
01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
on that committee and I said I'm going

so hopefully everybody has copies of the
 
01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
letter that we submitted
 
01:36:09.649 --> 01:36:09.659 align:start position:0%
um so I'll go over what's in there so
 
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
pursuant to hb2 chapter 79 429 to laws
 
01:36:17.209 --> 01:36:17.219 align:start position:0%
of 2023 funding
 
01:36:20.030 --> 01:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
um was appropriated for the Department
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
to conduct the third phase of our
 
01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
community response to cancer concerns in
 
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
Merrimack New Hampshire uh pursuant to
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
hb2 chapter 79 429.2 we were to come
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
before this committee prior to using
 
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
that appropriation for review
 
01:36:43.850 --> 01:36:43.860 align:start position:0%
that appropriation included five hundred
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to be used in this
 
01:36:49.450 --> 01:36:49.460 align:start position:0%
state biennium which ends June 30th 2025
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to contract with an academic
 
01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
or research organization who would be
 
01:36:57.110 --> 01:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
able to conduct what we call a
 
01:36:59.390 --> 01:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
feasibility study which is really
 
01:37:02.169 --> 01:37:02.179 align:start position:0%
focused on determining if there would be
 
01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
potential to actually apply for and get
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
funding for a full epidemiological study
 
01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
looking at kidney cancers and
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
environmental exposures in Merrimac
 
01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
pursuant to hb2 language the department
 
01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
was asked to identify if there was any
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
other funding Federal funding grant
 
01:37:29.689 --> 01:37:29.699 align:start position:0%
funding non-state funds that might be
 
01:37:32.450 --> 01:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
available to support that feasibility
 
01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:33.770 align:start position:0%
available to support that feasibility
study

01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:35.149 align:start position:0%
study
so

01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:35.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
um the the department has done their due
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
diligence in looking for that funding we
 
01:37:43.729 --> 01:37:43.739 align:start position:0%
routinely and systematically monitor for
 
01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
Federal grant funding we work closely
 
01:37:48.770 --> 01:37:48.780 align:start position:0%
with our federal agencies who provide
 
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
funding so the Centers for Disease
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
Control and prevention is one of our
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
primary Federal funders and we are not
 
01:37:58.750 --> 01:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
aware of any funding that would support
 
01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
this feasibility study and for a little
 
01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
bit of extra context a lot of the
 
01:38:06.050 --> 01:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
funding that we get is to support Public
 
01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
Health response and the work of the
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
public health agencies and this stage of
 
01:38:15.050 --> 01:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
the you know Community response that
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
includes a feasibility study really
 
01:38:19.610 --> 01:38:19.620 align:start position:0%
represents a step further than public
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
health response and more research work
 
01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
and so there aren't typically research
 
01:38:28.930 --> 01:38:28.940 align:start position:0%
grants that the department applies for
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
we have worked with academic Partners to
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
see if their grant funding opportunity
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
communities that might be available for
 
01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
them to apply for and have also not
 
01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:38:49.209 --> 01:38:49.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
seeing none you may continue
 
01:38:55.010 --> 01:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
okay I think that's pretty much it we
 
01:38:56.270 --> 01:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
just wanted to thank representative
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
Nancy Murphy representative Erica Leon
 
01:39:00.290 --> 01:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
and representative Maureen Mooney who
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
have been so helpful in getting this
 
01:39:03.770 --> 01:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
appropriation and enabling the
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
department to continue our response to
 
01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
the concerns of Merrimack
 
01:39:10.729 --> 01:39:10.739 align:start position:0%
so thank you good
 
01:39:10.739 --> 01:39:12.830 align:start position:0%
so thank you good
