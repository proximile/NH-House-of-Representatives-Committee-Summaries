morning welcome to Edna
 
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
uh we're I'm opening the public hearing
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 180 and I call
 
00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
Representative PR who will give us a
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
card when he's after he speaks
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
shame good morning Madam chair and
 
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
Mark PR Hillsboro 15 which is Ward 8 in
 
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester I come to you today uh with a
 
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
with an
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to the
 
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
of and I thought this was such a simple
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
bill it wouldn't need an amendment
 
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
apparently I was
 
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
wrong the amendment is just adding a
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
definition of a team
 
00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
leader uh so that people understand what
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
that job
 
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
is the original reason I I opened this
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
up again is
 
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
the international critical incident
 
00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
stress Foundation decided to come up
 
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
with a money maker in the form of a
 
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.110 align:start position:0%
with a money maker in the form of a
certification

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
test um that costs
 
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
$400 for the privilege of taking this
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
test after you've taken their
 
00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:22.230 align:start position:0%
test after you've taken their
course

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
um and it doesn't do
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
anything other than say you took the
 
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.670 align:start position:0%
anything other than say you took the
test

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
because even if you don't pass it you're
 
00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
not getting kicked off a team
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and so we found it unnecessary that
 
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
this language was in there that if
 
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
somebody said well everybody has to be
 
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
certified all of our team members are
 
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
volunteers they have jobs they have
 
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
other thing and as soon as uh this kind
 
00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
of came out that this was happening a
 
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
lot of team members reached out to me uh
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
and said we can't afford to do that we
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
won't be able to be on the team and I
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
said take a deep breath we'll figure
 
00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
this out I had other teams call me and
 
00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:12.589 align:start position:0%
this out I had other teams call me and
said

00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
hey this is really expensive I don't
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
think we can do this and and I and I
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's necessary right in
 
00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
the teams we're doing training we're
 
00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
making PE sure our our members are up to
 
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
date on their skills um we travel in a
 
00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
group when we do these things uh we have
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
a mental health professional also when
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
we're doing these things um either
 
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
depending on what we're doing whether
 
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's a a debriefing they're at the
 
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
debriefing if it's doing one-on-one uh
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
coaching and because we're not
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
counselors um we have that mental health
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
person that we can reach back to if we
 
00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
have any questions concerns or anything
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
like that that they can help us with so
 
00:09:04.069 --> 00:09:04.079 align:start position:0%
I don't believe this is really necessary
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
to have this certification test at
 
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:14.200 align:start position:0%
$400 um and I can give you
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
um a little background information about
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
the critical the international offline
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
if anybody wants to hear it but I don't
 
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
think I'm going to bore you all with
 
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
that and with that I'll I'll take any
 
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.110 align:start position:0%
that and with that I'll I'll take any
questions

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
all right thank you are there are there
 
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.030 align:start position:0%
all right thank you are there are there
any

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Lon and then
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
groda uh thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
you representative for bringing this to
 
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
us um I also see the amendment adds that
 
00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:43.959 align:start position:0%
it may or may not be affiliated with the
 
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
municipality for the incident team is
 
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
that an issue you've run into or are you
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
just busy cleaning up the language while
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
we have it open clearing up the language
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
while we have it open my team used to be
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
Loosely affiliated with nashille fire
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
but not so much and we we actually
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
became an independent standing
 
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
team uh and I want to make sure that
 
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
that can still continue without anybody
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
saying well here a lot of people are
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
affiliated so you should be affiliated
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
with a department and and that's not
 
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
necessary follow up follow up and as a
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
followup does that make it easier for
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
your teams to provide services to more
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
more people who need it throughout the
 
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.110 align:start position:0%
more people who need it throughout the
state

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
so I our team the Grand State critical
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
incident stress management team was the
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
first team in the state approximately 40
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
years ago uh and we provided Services
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the state to police Fire EMS
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms any emergency responder
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
we took care of um and in the early days
 
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
we used to go to Maine Vermont
 
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because we were one of the
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
only teams in the area now there are
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
more teams which is great uh that way we
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
have plenty of people to make sure
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
nobody gets missed
 
00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:01.639 align:start position:0%
so thank you and thank you for what you
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
do thanks okay Reps for oh and then
 
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.470 align:start position:0%
do thanks okay Reps for oh and then
Howard

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
Howard
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so
 
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
um what you're saying I just want to
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that I'm reading the bill
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
correctly you're saying the team members
 
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
shall undergo initial
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
icif but you're at the bottom and C
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
below you're also saying the team
 
00:11:30.509 --> 00:11:30.519 align:start position:0%
leadership shall be responsible training
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
team members sitting so the team the
 
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
team leaders training is different no
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing same thing they just
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
want to make
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
sure so you could
 
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
have critical incident stress for
 
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
groups or you could have it for
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
individuals most of us have both of
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
those classes because the uh icisf has
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
created what they call a grin class
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
where they take those two classes
 
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
usually they're three three days each
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
but when you put them together at the
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
same time a lot of the material overlaps
 
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
so they can do both classes in three
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
days thank you that's
 
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
helpful repr
 
00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
power so uh thank you for taking my
 
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
question so uh similarly uh I understand
 
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
that we're taking out the uh sustaining
 
00:12:25.189 --> 00:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
of certification standards how
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
frequently are those certification

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
hor thank you very much Madam chair as I
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
am indeed represent Timothy Horan from
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
straford County District 10 which is the
 
00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
town of Durham so I'm the prime and only
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor of HP
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
438 which is a uh well it's a uh L Bill
 
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
although I appear to be the only witness
 
00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:32.839 align:start position:0%
speaking for it um first of all I I'll
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
mention I got an email this morning from
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
Maggie Fogerty from the American friends
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
service committee which by the way is an
 
00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
organization I belong to or at least
 
00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
occasionally uh send money into so uh
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
she she told me that she sent some email
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and I have not seen it but
 
00:38:51.309 --> 00:38:51.319 align:start position:0%
hopefully hopefully the members of the
 
00:38:52.829 --> 00:38:52.839 align:start position:0%
committee especially the clerk will
 
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
track down the email and make sure
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's in the bill file whatever so
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
whatever she said I'm sure
 
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
is uh is excellent probably better than
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
what I have prepared but anyway here
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
goes so this bill HB 438 is an update of
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
the second half of a bill which is I
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
think it was in this committee eight
 
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:13.720 align:start position:0%
years ago um HB 558 that bill didn't go
 
00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
that far but that was mostly because of
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
problems with the first part of the bill
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
which dealt with for-profit prisons
 
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:21.640 align:start position:0%
although I should add dep parting a
 
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:23.079 align:start position:0%
little bit from written testimony that
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
actually that issue there was by far as
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
an interest in it and actually uh
 
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
not too long afterwards I think in 2021
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
a similar Bill actually was passed some
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
Republicans took up the issue and
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
Governor s had a ceremonial signing of
 
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
it so a a bill about for-profit prisons
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
was in fact passed not long afterwards
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
but anyway so uh then and now for-profit
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
prisons did not and do not exist in New
 
00:39:49.309 --> 00:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but there were situations
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
where inmates need to be placed out of
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
state possibly in for-profit facilities
 
00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:56.200 align:start position:0%
um the immigration detention faity was
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
relatively non controversial at the time
 
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
at least not not like it is now there
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't quite the U what I might almost
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
call hysteria over the issue um but
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
there was it still is only one
 
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
immigration Detention Facility New
 
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that's straford County
 
00:40:13.069 --> 00:40:13.079 align:start position:0%
Jail which is used for nonviolent
 
00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
detainees whose only major alleged
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
offense was being in the country without
 
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
permission some of them are also brought
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
in for minor crimes but if you're like a
 
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839 align:start position:0%
really uh if you're accused of something
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
really serious you don't go to the jail
 
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
they send you to other facilities so
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
it's um it's nonviolent offenders um a
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
few years ago I visited uh visited the
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
dormatory there the kept them and a lot
 
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
large number of those were just kept in
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
an old part of the jail in a uh you know
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
with fairly minimal supervision they
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
were hanging around watching I think a
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
soccer game on TV so they were
 
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079 align:start position:0%
definitely not a they did not look like
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
a crowd of hardened criminals and they
 
00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.750 align:start position:0%
a crowd of hardened criminals and they
were

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
but so um and actually straford County
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
Jail's business partially grow out of we
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
we've have a long standing
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
relationship with being a processing
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
point for federal detainees so we often
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
transfer them from the state system to
 
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
the federal system um at straford County
 
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
anyway my bill simply mandated best
 
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
practices which the jail was already
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
honoring for various reasons not the
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
least of which was the fact that the
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
jail was contractually obligated to
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
follow those practices anyway but also
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
because U they're the right thing to do
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
and it makes you know just makes life
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
easier for you know both the correction
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
staff and the detainees so first of all
 
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
this bill updates the previous 2017 Bill
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
to refer to the current uh 2025
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
additions of various documents and
 
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.150 align:start position:0%
additions of various documents and
regulations

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
um far as I know all those regulations
 
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
are still in place you know there's a
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
lot of uncertainty what's going on
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
Washington DC but we should assume that
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
all those various regulations are still
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
operative and frankly it does go further
 
00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
and U an attempt to pre prevent some of
 
00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
the abuses inherent in president Trump
 
00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
threatened Mass deportations so
 
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
immigration detention phys will not be
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
allowed to detain citizens of the United
 
00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:02.839 align:start position:0%
States um they must not be large to
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
detain large numbers of people based
 
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
solely on ethnicity or National Origins
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
so you have to be detaining People based
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
on what they individually are doing
 
00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
facilities must be under civilian
 
00:42:14.829 --> 00:42:14.839 align:start position:0%
control if they're authorized by the
 
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
state they also must not be operated by
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
for-profit entities and that you know
 
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
that in line with the overall lack of
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
for profit prisons here in New Hampshire
 
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately we don't really have
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
the power to stop the Federal government
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
from operating its own
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
facilities within our within our borders
 
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
but we would if this bill becomes law
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
would be routinely asking the feds to
 
00:42:38.349 --> 00:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
inform us of the existence of such
 
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
facilities and finally the governor
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
cannot deploy would not be able to
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
deploy the National Guard for
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
immigration deportation activities
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
without the consent of the executive
 
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
Council so the purpose of all this aside
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
from Simply you know continuing to obey
 
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
the best practices we've been obeying is
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
also prevent or at least discourage the
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
state government cooperating with any ma
 
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
future Mass deportation campaigns so I I
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
would just frankly say Mass deportation
 
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
is contrary to our tradition of
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
Tolerance and Live Free or Die so I I
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
urge you to uh I urge you urge you so I
 
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
urge you to pass this bill especially
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
you know I'm seeing probably the parts
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
that like um are the same as my just an
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
update of my previous Bill especially
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be controversial at all and we
 
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
should you know so I urge you to pass
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
the bill with that I'd be happy to take
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you represent Horgan
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
committee president Bailey
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um in response to a
 
00:43:41.549 --> 00:43:41.559 align:start position:0%
question not too long ago straford
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
County Commissioner mclara says there is
 
00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.230 align:start position:0%
County Commissioner mclara says there is
no

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
contract they have an agreement
 
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay okay that's the does that affect
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
this at all when you mentioned
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
contractual obligations that's probably
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
fair enough but we are Prov the services
 
00:43:59.470 --> 00:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
and the federal government is paying for
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
it so there's a you implied contract
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
there so
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
probably I mean if you probably whatever
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
represent commission well he used to be
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
a representative commissioner McClair so
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
he he's not here today to to clarify
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
that I have heard him talking about it
 
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
we're both on the executive committee so
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's a fair question um possibly
 
00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
possibly the committee might want to
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
reach out to them before reaches a final
 
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
decision on the pill and you know have
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
him you know it would be would have been
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know he's got a lot of this things
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
to do it would have certainly been very
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
good to have him here and if I've made
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
an error I apologize and I'm sure he
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
would politely but firmly set set me
 
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
straight on that but I mean but there is
 
00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
at least an implied contract we're
 
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
taking money and we're providing the
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
services to the federal government
 
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
so and thank you and they wouldn't pay
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
us if we weren't following these
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
regulations okay we Leon thank you madam
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative are
 
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
you concerned that you're inserting a
 
00:44:58.549 --> 00:44:58.559 align:start position:0%
new St uh chapter in our statute that to
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
me reads like it's allowing the state to
 
00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
create immigration detention facilities
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
and are you worried about the Legacy
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
that might lead leave you in the future
 
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
when uh policies change well I I would
 
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:13.720 align:start position:0%
prer that we not not not regulate we
 
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
would not create them but I think it's
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
probably better have some Protections in
 
00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:20.200 align:start position:0%
place uh you know rather than not have
 
00:45:22.109 --> 00:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
them since it is a possibility I mean I
 
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
would prefer um you we don't have
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
private prisons here in New Hampshire
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
and I guess NE detention facilities is
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
not quite the same thing as a private
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
prison but um and certainly would be so
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
I would I would like to have at least
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
some framework for regulating them in
 
00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
place so I'm I'm comfortable with adding
 
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
another chapter to our law book which
 
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
already has hundreds of chapters in it
 
00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
anyway you can see
 
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
how I guess it's not over here in the
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
corner room but it's you know it's a
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
very large volume very large set of
 
00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
volumes thank you other
 
00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
00:45:52.359 --> 00:45:53.510 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
representative

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Madame chair I'm here to
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
present an amendment to House Bill
 
00:46:16.829 --> 00:46:16.839 align:start position:0%
538 which was drafted by Representative
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
Patrick long and I'm here presenting it
 
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:21.559 align:start position:0%
as a draft on his
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
behalf I asked him to look at House Bill
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
438 because he is an immigration assur
 
00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
attorney and I thought his input would
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
be valuable for the committee he did
 
00:46:38.109 --> 00:46:38.119 align:start position:0%
strike out certain Clauses in the bill
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
the first one if you want to look at
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
house bill I I took the liberty of
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
looking at his draft and looking at the
 
00:46:47.109 --> 00:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
bill and I thought it might be
 
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
beneficial for you if I just noted
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
it he remov section D1 which talks about
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
the prohibition of private
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
contracts he removes section
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
four which
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
describes the immigration Detention
 
00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
Facility operator as an an agent of the
 
00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
immigration Detention Facility um the
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
immigration Detention Facility operator
 
00:47:14.589 --> 00:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
is also defined in three and he prefers
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
the the definition in three rather than
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
four he removed Clause five which talks
 
00:47:23.309 --> 00:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
about involuntary placement in
 
00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:25.720 align:start position:0%
segregated because of their or his
 
00:47:28.109 --> 00:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
actual gender gender identity he removed
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
that part on line 32 where it says Mass
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
deportation of immigrants he replaced
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
that phrase with actually it's not a
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
phrase he replaced that quotation with
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
segregated housing and those are the
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
changes that were made on the
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
amendment and he replac he asks that we
 
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
look at the amendment and replace the
 
00:47:51.309 --> 00:47:51.319 align:start position:0%
amendment in
 
00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
whole I don't know if you have any
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
so he tottally rewrote the chapter
 
00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.390 align:start position:0%
so he tottally rewrote the chapter
correct

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:06.030 align:start position:0%
correct
exactly

00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative Le um thank you
 
00:48:10.829 --> 00:48:10.839 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for presenting
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
this for him I do see that on the
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
existing bill there's already a
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
definition of segregated housing is he
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
potentially just removing that mass
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
section because um if you go from secary
 
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
at housing and then to the new section
 
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
ordering the National Guard then that
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
would look like maybe it was just
 
00:48:34.109 --> 00:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
removed you're right I'm sorry I missed
 
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
that no thank you for interpreting this
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
on the flag thank
 
00:48:37.079 --> 00:48:40.510 align:start position:0%
on the flag thank
you

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
okay representative Howard thank you uh
 
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
I mean this I don't know if this would
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
be more of appropriate to bring up
 
00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
during an executive session but um as
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
for uh in paragraph one uh it talk about
 
00:48:59.950 --> 00:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
detaining immigrants I'm just wondering
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
if it would be worthwhile adding because
 
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
this isn't an official uh Amendment yet
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh arrests as well just because of uh
 
00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:12.839 align:start position:0%
some of the federal uh legislation that
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
has just recently be been passed
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
um sorry are you talking about the
 
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
amendment uh yes it's yeah do you it
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
says enter into contract cont to detain
 
00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:39.549 align:start position:0%
says enter into contract cont to detain
immigrants

00:49:39.549 --> 00:49:39.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
um I think this conversation we might
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
have with representative long okay thank
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
you I mean he's he chose this language
 
00:49:50.829 --> 00:49:50.839 align:start position:0%
because he felt that it was more
 
00:49:52.349 --> 00:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
indicative of what a contract should
 
00:49:52.359 --> 00:49:54.710 align:start position:0%
indicative of what a contract should
look

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
like and I believe it would be uh
 
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
inadvisable to uh vote on this bill and
 
00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
L representative long we're here that
 
00:50:05.789 --> 00:50:05.799 align:start position:0%
will be I appreciate that thank you so
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
much all right is there any other
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%

right there's
 
00:50:20.789 --> 00:50:20.799 align:start position:0%

01:03:51.069 --> 01:03:51.079 align:start position:0%
right being 11 o'c I'm opening the
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 598 and I call
 
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
Representative Coran
 
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um so as we all know there are
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
various right to know laws both at the
 
01:04:03.309 --> 01:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
federal and the state level here in New
 
01:04:06.029 --> 01:04:06.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have RSA 91a which is
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
wonderful um and I've used RSA 91a
 
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
multiple times in doing requests at the
 
01:04:13.269 --> 01:04:13.279 align:start position:0%
Town level and this has allowed me to do
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of interesting stuff like uh
 
01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
expose a illegal classification system
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh discover illegal meetings and other
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
things so um there's going to be you
 
01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
know questions I imagine of hey don't we
 
01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
already have this I'm fully aware of
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
what we have and I want to talk about
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
something new there are some problems
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
with RSA 91a which is that first of all
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
citizens need to know what they're
 
01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
looking for and uh sometimes even when
 
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
they know what they're looking for they
 
01:04:42.349 --> 01:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
can request it and uh the law requires
 
01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:44.440 align:start position:0%
that um government employees respond
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
within 10 days but one of the things
 
01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
that they can say is hey it's day nine
 
01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to tell you it's going to
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
be 16 months until you get what you want
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing uh that is a problem is
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
each and every request that comes in uh
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
puts additional labor on the government
 
01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
employees who are responding to it um
 
01:05:02.349 --> 01:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
and that is an actual real cost and
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons that things
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
often stack up and go very slowly and
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
the uh another problem is that when
 
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
things come back they are often scanned
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
um they're you know misaligned Etc not
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
machine readable so in the private
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
sector uh I have run some small
 
01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
companies and you know even as far back
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
as the year 2000 so a quarter of a
 
01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
century ago anyone who spins up the
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
smallest of companies with a website and
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
get software packages you're selling
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
T-shirts or Pottery or something and
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
you'll get to see a corporate dashboard
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
updated in real time how many people
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
visited the website how many people
 
01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
lingered on the page for at least 60
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
seconds how many things went into a
 
01:05:38.829 --> 01:05:38.839 align:start position:0%
shopping cart how many shopping carts
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
were abandoned and you can do the other
 
01:05:42.269 --> 01:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
thing on outflows using you know quick
 
01:05:44.349 --> 01:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
in and other tools uh show me exactly
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
where my money went show me the average
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
time in between invoicing someone
 
01:05:47.839 --> 01:05:48.670 align:start position:0%
time in between invoicing someone
getting

01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
paid and uh if you're a good business
 
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
person you can use this to great effect
 
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
say Hey you know my advertising is
 
01:05:56.269 --> 01:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
obviously working tons of people are
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
coming in but you know here's the
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
problem so um there is no equivalent
 
01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
when it comes to either state or local
 
01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
government with this there are a few
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
things that you know attempt uh so for
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
example the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:13.640 align:start position:0%
Education has some statistics on saus
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
and uh when I look up where for example
 
01:06:18.029 --> 01:06:18.039 align:start position:0%
the most recent data is I believe seven
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
years old and um it is also in the form
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
of graphs and graphs are nice um but
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
they are you know they're human legible
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
but they're not machine legible so if I
 
01:06:29.549 --> 01:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
wanted to spin up a simple you know
 
01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
10line software script that was going to
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh pull down say the school results for
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
every school in Hillsboro County or all
 
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire and then also go
 
01:06:40.109 --> 01:06:40.119 align:start position:0%
over to the Department of Revenue and
 
01:06:42.109 --> 01:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
pull down all of the data over there
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
about um taxation levels per you know
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
thousand of assessed property this is a
 
01:06:50.269 --> 01:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
thing that in uh many areas of the world
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
you know I can um scrape data for you
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
know uh Journal articles on physics Etc
 
01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
I can you know go to the federal
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
government and there has been a federal
 
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
initiative that is at least 15 or 20
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
years long where they have defined XML
 
01:07:06.029 --> 01:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
standards and all sorts of data and New
 
01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is behind in this area um so
 
01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
uh and I just want to pull out a few
 
01:07:15.309 --> 01:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
things um that I think uh could be
 
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
useful uh so there's a lot of debate
 
01:07:20.589 --> 01:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
about how well does dco have to do its
 
01:07:22.349 --> 01:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
job and we've had some legislators who
 
01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
you know sort of alleg big conspiracies
 
01:07:27.069 --> 01:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
and everything um and I I think it's
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
very plausible to be interested in the
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
question without necessarily alleging
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
anything and so several years back my
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
wife and I uh brought in some foster
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
kids and we tried to work with DCF and
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
um it didn't work very well and so uh
 
01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:44.200 align:start position:0%
you know I have some questions of hey
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
was this a oneoff or how well does this
 
01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
organization work so um I would like to
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
see for example uh DCF how many children
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
are taken into foster uh care every year
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
how many are you know reunited with
 
01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
their parents within 12 months how many
 
01:08:02.589 --> 01:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
of them once they're in dcyf custody uh
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
are given a doctor's appointment and
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
gotten up toate on their immunizations
 
01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
uh many of these children you know
 
01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
obviously have real problems they
 
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be in DCF care if they weren't
 
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
how many of them have seen a therapist
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
within 30 days or 60 days or 90 days in
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
Private Industry numbers like this are
 
01:08:20.189 --> 01:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
often referred to as kpis or key
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
performance metrics uh and there is a
 
01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
mantra you get what you measure so there
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
can be very uh low ranker discussion
 
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
about what exactly should DCF uh be
 
01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
doing there's lots of different things
 
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
we might prioritize family reuniting we
 
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
might prioritize uh children getting
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
good access to therapy Etc or in
 
01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
policing what should we what metrics do
 
01:08:44.669 --> 01:08:44.679 align:start position:0%
we actually care about in policing do we
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
care about number of arrests do we care
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
about Rehabilitation do we care about
 
01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
average speed on the roads um if we were
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
to have machine readable and easily uh
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
capturable and downloadable data in
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
these things it would lead I suggest to
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
a lot more um both citizen awareness so
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
they could say you know hey I've been
 
01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
grumbling about the police budget for
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years but I had no idea that
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
there were you know 17 arrests that
 
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
turned violent and that's why you know
 
01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
the tasers were actually a good thing um
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
and in DCF instead of you know having
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
allegations we just say hey DCF did you
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
know 45% of children were reunited with
 
01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
their parents is that trending up or
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
down it seems to be flat is perhaps that
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
something we want to look at so um there
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
are all sorts of data that are already
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
in the system and this is the lwh
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
hanging fruit we could put out
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
requirements um asking employees you
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
know I want you to compile uh you know
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
how many people were seen per day in the
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
state unemployment office or I want you
 
01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:46.759 align:start position:0%
to compile this I wanted to go in that
 
01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
format um but if we uh start defining
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
and telling people what data formats we
 
01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
want what data we want uh to be in there
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
what regularity we want this to be
 
01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
uploaded on we are potentially missing
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh sort of zero cost Gaines where this
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
data is already there so if I said I
 
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
wanted you know daily police reports it
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
might be that the police are compiling
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
monthly reports and submitting them to
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
the state police something like that
 
01:10:16.030 --> 01:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
actually does turn out to be true um and
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
just as a quick aside in that direction
 
01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
I've been talking to the local and State
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
Police they already engage in a data
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
reporting system with the FBI called uh
 
01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
dibbers I believe um I've gotten an
 
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
example of that data format this is
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
something that with about 11 seconds of
 
01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
effort per year someone in the State
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
Police already having all of these files
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
could just publish to a website so what
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
I'm proposing at this point is not a law
 
01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
requiring that these things be published
 
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
but a study committee uh ideally
 
01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
bipartisan that would uh do
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
investigation you know meet remotely
 
01:10:50.669 --> 01:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
over zoom and then we could each you
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
know head off into our own directions
 
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
and contact DCF and say hey what's
 
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
statistics do you already have what
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
formats are they in um and then
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully that study committee could
 
01:11:03.149 --> 01:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
come back and uh the chair and I
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
discussed ahead of time uh might this
 
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
want to have an expiration date and I
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
think that's a wonderful idea we
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
discussed ahead of time uh two years uh
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
I would support two years if that was
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
the best I could get uh I might suggest
 
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
three years and the reason for that is
 
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh ideally the output of the study
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
committee would be an iterative process
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
where a year from now there would be a
 
01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
bill on the table saying hey we ident
 
01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
ified 17 files that already exist please
 
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
let's just put into state law that they
 
01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
must be exposed every year by December
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
31st um and then we've also you know got
 
01:11:36.189 --> 01:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
leads on some other stuff that is maybe
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
not quite as well formatted or quite as
 
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
well defined and we could come back and
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
sort of uh you know slice the sausage
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
and get another bite at it you know with
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
a new law a year after that uh that is
 
01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
my proposal and uh I would welcome any
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you
 
01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.910 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you
representative

01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:11:59.229 --> 01:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
Roa thank you um um so this the intent
 
01:12:03.149 --> 01:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
of this study committee is to look at
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
data from all branches of government
 
01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
right that's correct okay follow up
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
follow up and you had mentioned
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
um kpis
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
yes and are you talking about kpis as
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
measured by the agency or are you
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
talking about kpis as you deem necessary
 
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely the former the point of this
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
is to find data that already exists is
 
01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
already being tracked and imposes almost
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
a zero cost on the agencies to
 
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
expose follow
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
up so
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
um might this lead
 
01:12:45.199 --> 01:12:47.590 align:start position:0%
um might this lead
to

01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.510 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
determining dup uh you know um
 
01:12:56.669 --> 01:12:56.679 align:start position:0%
redundancy the possible that agencies
 
01:13:00.189 --> 01:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
are are collecting the same data in two
 
01:13:03.149 --> 01:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
different formats for example that is um
 
01:13:05.709 --> 01:13:05.719 align:start position:0%
so uh certainly it's possible that you
 
01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
know when we reach if the study
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
committee were to be established and if
 
01:13:12.030 --> 01:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
we were to reach out and we said to DCF
 
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
please tell us your internal reports uh
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
what they look like how often they're
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
compiled um we might learn that division
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
a has a report that you know has pieces
 
01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
one two and three of data we might learn
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
that division B has some other report
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
that partially overlaps
 
01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
um the intent of this bill you know and
 
01:13:31.229 --> 01:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
I mentioned not just the bill itself but
 
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
the the very expected followon is not to
 
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
sort of directly go after agencies and
 
01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
reform them but merely to expose
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
information and uh that information
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
could then be used by citizens and
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
legislators in you know ideally a
 
01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
non-confrontational way to say Hey you
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
know we never knew that DCF you know for
 
01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
example had this issue with only 30% of
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
children are getting some sort
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
um but it could also as you raise uh you
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
know the thing also say hey wait a
 
01:14:01.709 --> 01:14:01.719 align:start position:0%
second we found out that the state
 
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
police are patrolling this road um we've
 
01:14:05.629 --> 01:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
also found out that the local police are
 
01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:07.719 align:start position:0%
patrolling it there's redundant effort
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
there or we found out that there are
 
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
multiple different reports that are
 
01:14:13.229 --> 01:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
reporting on the same thing um you know
 
01:14:15.229 --> 01:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to presume exactly what
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
will be found um but I can imagine all
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
sorts of things and uh I I can imagine
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
not just potentially cost savings by
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
eliminating redundancy um but I could
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
just imagine uh that Downstream of this
 
01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
we would have better utilization of
 
01:14:31.629 --> 01:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
resources as both the citizens and the
 
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
organizations themselves uh got Fuller
 
01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
access to the metrics that are being
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
collected thank you thank you all right
 
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
represent Howard thank you for uh taking
 
01:14:44.629 --> 01:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
my question so this is a lot of
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
information and we're talking about
 
01:14:50.189 --> 01:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
producing a report on by uh by November
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
1st 2025 so we're looking at maybe like
 
01:14:56.669 --> 01:14:56.679 align:start position:0%
five six months uh of uh committee work
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
before the report's
 
01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
created I'm not necessarily sure that's
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
enough time if we were going to be
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
looking at every single uh part of our
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
government and trying to compile this
 
01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
information excuse me representative
 
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
Howard the amendment I'm getting to
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
delete the excess Senators would also
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
extend the
 
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh would also require a second report in
 
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
26 one in 25 and one in 26 okay and and
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
I strongly support that you're right you
 
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
know um the the goal with this bill is
 
01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
just to get something out there get the
 
01:15:32.629 --> 01:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
process started um I think that you know
 
01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
one could probably study this for years
 
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
and keep finding more stuff yeah okay
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you okay other
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lon do you have
 
01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
a question uh thank you madam chair and
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for bringing
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
this to us um to me it seems like what
 
01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do is get clarity on
 
01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
the data that's already available make
 
01:15:54.629 --> 01:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
it so that this can be looked at so that
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
we can ask better questions and then
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
have better policy Solutions is that a
 
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
correct interpretation that is very well
 
01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
uh phrased and yes exactly thank you
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
okay represent
 
01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
G thank you so how do we handle data
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
confidential I um so this commission uh
 
01:16:18.669 --> 01:16:18.679 align:start position:0%
would merely find out what data exists
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
um I think that it might be written into
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
this bill but it's certainly been
 
01:16:23.310 --> 01:16:23.320 align:start position:0%
written into other bills that I've
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
submitted in the past that eii or
 
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information
 
01:16:29.709 --> 01:16:29.719 align:start position:0%
should absolutely continue to be
 
01:16:31.709 --> 01:16:31.719 align:start position:0%
restricted and nothing either in this
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
bill or in Downstream bills would ever
 
01:16:35.669 --> 01:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
seek to weaken those protections thank
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
okay other questions all right thank you
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
very much thank you very much rush off
 
01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
to another hearing thank you oh good
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
enjoy uh
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and also members
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:01.400 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
Gary Merchant former representative uh I
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
live in clamont and I'm here
 
01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.030 align:start position:0%
live in clamont and I'm here
representing

01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
representing
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
myself you previously heard a bill
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
dealing with the prescription drug
 
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
affordability board and that dealt with
 
01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
redundancy and I think there's
 
01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
redundancy in States because what
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
happens within the agencies in my
 
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
opinion the various agencies have their
 
01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
own silos and the data resides in the
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
silos in order to get from one Silo to
 
01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
the other today it's very difficult to
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
do sometimes if not impossible I can
 
01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
share with you a story I worked at the
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
medical center at Dartmouth for many
 
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
years we had a data warehouse so what
 
01:17:42.189 --> 01:17:42.199 align:start position:0%
would happen is that departments would
 
01:17:45.149 --> 01:17:45.159 align:start position:0%
like our agencies create data calls or
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
create ways to collect the data they
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
wanted or things that they would
 
01:17:51.229 --> 01:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
normally have but the data was put into
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
the data warehouse which allowed for
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
multiple departments to to get to the
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
data provided they have access and
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
confidentiality to it so they could not
 
01:18:01.629 --> 01:18:01.639 align:start position:0%
access the data unless they had the
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate authorization to do so I
 
01:18:06.910 --> 01:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
think what I would say is this is a if
 
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
you want try to make the government more
 
01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
efficient this is definitely one of the
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
ways to do it I would make a couple
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the committee though
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
in my time in the
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
house asking for three members for the
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
Senate is a heavy
 
01:18:24.510 --> 01:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
lift if you can get one you'd be lucky
 
01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
um the other one too is online 7 I think
 
01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
it's important we have members in the
 
01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
house but most likely there's members in
 
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
the house that have subject matter
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
expertise in this area and I would
 
01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
encourage the house at that point in
 
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
time either through the speaker or
 
01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
through the bill itself to put that into
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
the language but that's where I'm coming
 
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
from I think it's a great idea I think
 
01:18:46.830 --> 01:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
it was actually floated around probably
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
be six seven years ago um it wasn't
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
there I think Dennis gay um commissioner
 
01:18:53.669 --> 01:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
gay with the Department of Information
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
Technology with great person to reach
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
out to I believe there's already things
 
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
in place that they do today that they
 
01:19:00.510 --> 01:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
could build upon so you don't have to
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
start from scratch so that's where I'm
 
01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
coming from all right thank you very
 
01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you is there
 
01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to speak on House
 
01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:19.189 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to speak on House
Bill

01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
598 okay I will mention that I'm getting
 
01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
an amendment um
 
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
to delete the Senators extended by a
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
year add a second report I mean put in a
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
repeal date two years out at the end of
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
the session and get two reports if the
 
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
first report is exceptionally valuable
 
01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
we can extend it if necessary but uh we
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
should have a
 
01:19:45.199 --> 01:19:46.750 align:start position:0%
should have a
deadline

01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
and is there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
represent gr I just have a comment on
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment if the chair would
 
01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
consider putting members of both the
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
majority and the minority because it
 
01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
won't be partisan it won't be bipartisan
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
unless we have both represented I okay
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
that's definitely a recommendation we
 
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
will uh write up our committee report to
 
01:20:16.990 --> 01:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
indicate that this is not a partisan
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
issue by any
 
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
it Mr Joy do you wish to testify or just
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
listening okay in that case I will close
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
598 we can't vote on it till we have the
 
01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:38.719 align:start position:0%
amendment and we have a nice long lunch
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.639 --> 01:21:23.550 align:start position:0%

sorry um addresses for police
 
03:04:32.830 --> 03:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
retirees the
 
03:04:36.349 --> 03:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
hours that they are able to
 
03:04:40.710 --> 03:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
work after retirement now at
 
03:04:42.870 --> 03:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
present they are I'm going to get the
 
03:04:42.880 --> 03:04:45.269 align:start position:0%
present they are I'm going to get the
exact

03:04:45.269 --> 03:04:45.279 align:start position:0%
exact
 
03:04:47.389 --> 03:04:47.399 align:start position:0%
number bear with me for a second I'm
 
03:04:47.399 --> 03:04:48.389 align:start position:0%
number bear with me for a second I'm
sorry

03:04:48.389 --> 03:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:04:51.830 --> 03:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
at present a retired
 
03:04:54.309 --> 03:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
um law enforcement
 
03:04:59.590 --> 03:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
officer can work a maximum of 1664 hours
 
03:05:02.389 --> 03:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
a year by
 
03:05:07.309 --> 03:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
rule um if they retired early enough if
 
03:05:08.870 --> 03:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
right if that
 
03:05:12.309 --> 03:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
is actually if they
 
03:05:16.790 --> 03:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
retired ear uh before January 1 of 19 I
 
03:05:18.750 --> 03:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
think is the cut off
 
03:05:21.429 --> 03:05:21.439 align:start position:0%
something in any event a current retiree
 
03:05:24.389 --> 03:05:24.399 align:start position:0%
is is at 135
 
03:05:28.990 --> 03:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
1352 yeah okay so they're limited to
 
03:05:32.510 --> 03:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
working basically 26 hours a week after
 
03:05:37.070 --> 03:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
retirement and the intent of that is to
 
03:05:40.830 --> 03:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
prevent a law enforcement officer from
 
03:05:43.229 --> 03:05:43.239 align:start position:0%
retiring and then deciding that they're
 
03:05:45.269 --> 03:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
going to take a position with that same
 
03:05:47.389 --> 03:05:47.399 align:start position:0%
department or a department within a
 
03:05:49.750 --> 03:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
state doing the same
 
03:05:52.790 --> 03:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
duties which makes sense in totality
 
03:05:54.070 --> 03:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
because that would eliminate the
 
03:05:58.190 --> 03:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a new hire to come in
 
03:06:00.870 --> 03:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
and uh give Revenue to the retirement
 
03:06:03.870 --> 03:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
system and and keep funding that system
 
03:06:03.880 --> 03:06:04.590 align:start position:0%
system and and keep funding that system
in

03:06:04.590 --> 03:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:06:11.830 --> 03:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:15.910 --> 03:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
nhrs has made with without Direction
 
03:06:18.070 --> 03:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
basically it was a call for them
 
03:06:22.990 --> 03:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
to not allow extra duty hours to have
 
03:06:26.110 --> 03:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
extra duty hours so outside detail
 
03:06:28.190 --> 03:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
traffic direction things like that not
 
03:06:30.309 --> 03:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
the day-to-day policing that our law
 
03:06:31.990 --> 03:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers
 
03:06:37.030 --> 03:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
do um so they're counting a detail that
 
03:06:41.429 --> 03:06:41.439 align:start position:0%
a retired member may take as towards the
 
03:06:45.710 --> 03:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
1352 hours okay and the problem in that
 
03:06:50.389 --> 03:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:54.750 --> 03:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
one present employees in the
 
03:06:58.269 --> 03:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
system those extra duty hours which are
 
03:07:01.229 --> 03:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
available to them to work those extra
 
03:07:03.429 --> 03:07:03.439 align:start position:0%
duty hours and pay does not apply to
 
03:07:05.349 --> 03:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
their retirement it's not a calculator
 
03:07:07.550 --> 03:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
in their
 
03:07:09.950 --> 03:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
retirement secondarily there's no
 
03:07:13.150 --> 03:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
definitive language to guide the
 
03:07:15.389 --> 03:07:15.399 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
into singling out the language in
 
03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
relation to extra duty pay or private
 
03:07:21.840 --> 03:07:23.389 align:start position:0%
relation to extra duty pay or private
work

03:07:23.389 --> 03:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:07:26.590 --> 03:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
details so this piece of
 
03:07:28.870 --> 03:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
legislation would lay that out clearly
 
03:07:28.880 --> 03:07:30.309 align:start position:0%
legislation would lay that out clearly
in

03:07:30.309 --> 03:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:07:33.269 --> 03:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
statute I must say that this is a you
 
03:07:37.190 --> 03:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
know we have an ongoing issue in in all
 
03:07:39.950 --> 03:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
service Fields specifically specifically
 
03:07:41.870 --> 03:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
fire and police
 
03:07:45.229 --> 03:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
Corrections on retention of employees
 
03:07:47.510 --> 03:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
recruitment of employees and this may
 
03:07:50.630 --> 03:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
help in that vein to some extent our our
 
03:07:53.110 --> 03:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
retirees some of them find themselves
 
03:07:54.950 --> 03:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
going out of state leaving New Hampshire
 
03:07:56.910 --> 03:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
we'd like to keep them here and the
 
03:07:58.550 --> 03:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
communities would like to keep them in
 
03:08:00.030 --> 03:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
the communities because they know the
 
03:08:02.389 --> 03:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
communities working traffic and and
 
03:08:05.070 --> 03:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
whatnot so it just makes a lot of common
 
03:08:07.670 --> 03:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
sense so this would uh kind of
 
03:08:11.349 --> 03:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
incentivize that also another peripheral
 
03:08:14.469 --> 03:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
benefit is the communities all of them
 
03:08:16.030 --> 03:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
that I know of uh charge an
 
03:08:18.510 --> 03:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
administrative fee so it's a revenue
 
03:08:20.870 --> 03:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
generator for the communities in
 
03:08:24.950 --> 03:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
itself so this is a uh to be clear it's
 
03:08:27.269 --> 03:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
it's not a cost issue this does not cost
 
03:08:31.550 --> 03:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
the state a penny it does not leverage
 
03:08:33.349 --> 03:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
anything other than the ability to
 
03:08:35.229 --> 03:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
Define for the New Hampshire retirement
 
03:08:39.309 --> 03:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
system that extra duty hours are not
 
03:08:41.750 --> 03:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
part of that 1352
 
03:08:44.349 --> 03:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
calculus so they can still work up to
 
03:08:47.750 --> 03:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
1352 hours doing Street P Patrol doing
 
03:08:51.110 --> 03:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh desk work whatever it is this is very
 
03:08:53.910 --> 03:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
narrowly crafted for the outside detail
 
03:08:56.110 --> 03:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
stuff special detail stuff and you'll
 
03:08:58.870 --> 03:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
hear and I'm sure
 
03:09:02.030 --> 03:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh officer gear will probably testify
 
03:09:04.190 --> 03:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
to the fact and I know we've all seen it
 
03:09:06.910 --> 03:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
I've seen it in my town of Salem where
 
03:09:09.790 --> 03:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
you'll see uh construction going on and
 
03:09:11.830 --> 03:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
we'll have a cruiser from pelum or
 
03:09:15.150 --> 03:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
ainson or Hamstead or Windam in doing a
 
03:09:18.070 --> 03:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
road detail in Salem
 
03:09:20.030 --> 03:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh great
 
03:09:23.309 --> 03:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
organizations a great uh Mutual Aid
 
03:09:26.150 --> 03:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
Network amongst the towns but the fact
 
03:09:29.070 --> 03:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
remains is we could have people living
 
03:09:31.950 --> 03:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
in our communities our retirees people
 
03:09:34.710 --> 03:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
that know the town that they worked for
 
03:09:36.510 --> 03:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
doing those
 
03:09:39.830 --> 03:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
details yet for the the limitations on
 
03:09:43.590 --> 03:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:46.229 --> 03:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
so I'll take any questions if you thank
 
03:09:48.070 --> 03:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:09:50.790 --> 03:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
CCH are you saying that if these hours
 
03:09:53.269 --> 03:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
did not count towards retirement while
 
03:09:54.630 --> 03:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
they were
 
03:09:58.150 --> 03:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
active officers they should these hours
 
03:10:00.670 --> 03:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
should not have any effect after
 
03:10:02.790 --> 03:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
retirement that's the short version
 
03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:06.309 align:start position:0%
retirement that's the short version
right

03:10:06.309 --> 03:10:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:12.030 --> 03:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:14.630 --> 03:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
questions represent bro thank you I have
 
03:10:17.389 --> 03:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
a question of the chair have we seen a
 
03:10:19.469 --> 03:10:19.479 align:start position:0%
Bill like this before I'm just trying to
 
03:10:22.870 --> 03:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
I know that we've we've had bills
 
03:10:26.550 --> 03:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
about after retirement work
 
03:10:30.349 --> 03:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
hours yes we haven't had one that
 
03:10:34.910 --> 03:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
specifically deals with extra Duty okay
 
03:10:37.510 --> 03:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
great thank you at least not to my
 
03:10:40.229 --> 03:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
memory it was just the total hours that
 
03:10:41.110 --> 03:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
made a
 
03:10:44.830 --> 03:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
difference yes sir thank you madam chair
 
03:10:47.990 --> 03:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
so uh when you when when
 
03:10:50.670 --> 03:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
question was being raised uh you were
 
03:10:54.269 --> 03:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
saying no representative set right and
 
03:10:58.389 --> 03:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
Mark mavan was shaking his head also in
 
03:11:02.309 --> 03:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
agreement with you U uh and so has this
 
03:11:05.269 --> 03:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
my question is has this proposal been
 
03:11:08.389 --> 03:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
vetted to make sure that it does not
 
03:11:10.150 --> 03:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
conflict with what we want
 
03:11:13.750 --> 03:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative the represent the Mr
 
03:11:16.150 --> 03:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
Kavanagh will be speaking next right so
 
03:11:17.910 --> 03:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
he should have that information well but
 
03:11:20.429 --> 03:11:20.439 align:start position:0%
I'm asking representative set whether he
 
03:11:24.309 --> 03:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
has vetted this I would defer I I would
 
03:11:27.910 --> 03:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
let him thank you I I I would just again
 
03:11:31.469 --> 03:11:31.479 align:start position:0%
say there's there's zero cost to the
 
03:11:33.910 --> 03:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
state of the municipalities in this it
 
03:11:37.429 --> 03:11:37.439 align:start position:0%
affects no one it's a allaround win for
 
03:11:39.790 --> 03:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
all involved thank you thank you madam
 
03:11:50.550 --> 03:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:52.030 --> 03:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
03:11:54.830 --> 03:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
committee for the record I'm Mark kavar
 
03:11:56.590 --> 03:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
I'm deputy councel and compliance
 
03:12:00.110 --> 03:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
officer for the New Hampshire retirement
 
03:12:02.030 --> 03:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
system as
 
03:12:04.830 --> 03:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
we have our usual disclaimer we are not
 
03:12:08.910 --> 03:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
for or against this bill uh it's a
 
03:12:11.550 --> 03:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
policy decision for the committee to
 
03:12:15.309 --> 03:12:15.319 align:start position:0%
decide but we just wanted to point out
 
03:12:18.469 --> 03:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh one major area of concern and one
 
03:12:21.870 --> 03:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
minor area
 
03:12:25.670 --> 03:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
um the first concern is that this bill
 
03:12:28.389 --> 03:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
should not be read that a
 
03:12:34.309 --> 03:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
member can work 1352 hours or if granded
 
03:12:38.070 --> 03:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
1664 hours and then work as
 
03:12:41.670 --> 03:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
much special Duty as they want special
 
03:12:44.070 --> 03:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
Duties are work hours and if we were to
 
03:12:45.830 --> 03:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
find that over
 
03:12:49.309 --> 03:12:49.319 align:start position:0%
time say a six Monon or a yearlong
 
03:12:52.710 --> 03:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
period a retiree was averaging 40 or
 
03:12:56.830 --> 03:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
more hours a week between their regular
 
03:12:59.150 --> 03:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
and their special
 
03:12:59.160 --> 03:13:01.469 align:start position:0%
and their special
Duty

03:13:01.469 --> 03:13:01.479 align:start position:0%
Duty
 
03:13:04.110 --> 03:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
then and if the
 
03:13:07.469 --> 03:13:07.479 align:start position:0%
employers uh number for fulltime was 40
 
03:13:09.870 --> 03:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
hours we would restore that person to
 
03:13:11.830 --> 03:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
active service their pension would cease
 
03:13:13.670 --> 03:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
and they would be re-enrolled as an
 
03:13:13.680 --> 03:13:14.590 align:start position:0%
and they would be re-enrolled as an
active

03:13:14.590 --> 03:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
active
 
03:13:17.830 --> 03:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
member so although
 
03:13:21.389 --> 03:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
for certain members in tierc We do not
 
03:13:24.389 --> 03:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
count compensation for special
 
03:13:28.910 --> 03:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
Duty um for the purposes of enrollment
 
03:13:30.550 --> 03:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
we we would count the
 
03:13:35.229 --> 03:13:35.239 align:start position:0%
hours so uh otherwise you'd have someone
 
03:13:37.790 --> 03:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
who go and say all right I'll work 26
 
03:13:40.429 --> 03:13:40.439 align:start position:0%
hours a week pulling a regular shift in
 
03:13:43.190 --> 03:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
the cruiser and then I'll work 30 hours
 
03:13:45.429 --> 03:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
a week on special Duty you're working
 
03:13:47.830 --> 03:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
for the city you're assigned
 
03:13:50.590 --> 03:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
to the third party that has asked the
 
03:13:56.550 --> 03:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
city to to lease you so so to speak um
 
03:13:59.510 --> 03:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh because we've had situations and and
 
03:14:01.030 --> 03:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
I and I'll tell you why we count the
 
03:14:03.389 --> 03:14:03.399 align:start position:0%
hours for
 
03:14:06.110 --> 03:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
enrollment we had situation
 
03:14:08.870 --> 03:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
where uh there were sheriff's
 
03:14:11.309 --> 03:14:11.319 align:start position:0%
deputies working two or three regular
 
03:14:13.990 --> 03:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
shifts a week and the other two weeks
 
03:14:18.070 --> 03:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
they were transferring prisoners
 
03:14:19.990 --> 03:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
or the
 
03:14:22.070 --> 03:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
federal uh court
 
03:14:24.710 --> 03:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
system and that was special Duty and as
 
03:14:24.720 --> 03:14:25.429 align:start position:0%
system and that was special Duty and as
a

03:14:25.429 --> 03:14:25.439 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:14:28.190 --> 03:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
result if we were not to count those two
 
03:14:30.910 --> 03:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
days that they worked and were assigned
 
03:14:32.910 --> 03:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
to travel prisoners they'd only have
 
03:14:34.630 --> 03:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
three days and not 40 hours and they
 
03:14:36.550 --> 03:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be enrolled in the system at
 
03:14:39.790 --> 03:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
all and so to just
 
03:14:43.190 --> 03:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
treat uh special duty hours
 
03:14:45.469 --> 03:14:45.479 align:start position:0%
consistently we would count those hours
 
03:14:48.070 --> 03:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
into determining whether a
 
03:14:51.550 --> 03:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
retiree had in fact returned to
 
03:14:54.429 --> 03:14:54.439 align:start position:0%
full-time service regardless of what
 
03:14:57.229 --> 03:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
particular classification the employer
 
03:14:59.269 --> 03:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
made have ascribed to that person as
 
03:15:00.710 --> 03:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
full or
 
03:15:05.229 --> 03:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
part-time um so for instance if a person
 
03:15:08.830 --> 03:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
was grandfathered and allowed to work
 
03:15:14.990 --> 03:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
1664 hours that would be 52 weeks at 32
 
03:15:17.790 --> 03:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
hours a week this bill would allow them
 
03:15:21.110 --> 03:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
to work seven more hours of Special
 
03:15:24.349 --> 03:15:24.359 align:start position:0%
Duty now in a particular week they may
 
03:15:27.189 --> 03:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
work more the way our rules work and
 
03:15:30.030 --> 03:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
this is uh expressed in an interpretive
 
03:15:33.630 --> 03:15:33.640 align:start position:0%
memo for determining whether someone's
 
03:15:37.229 --> 03:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
stated work schedule reflects reality of
 
03:15:40.229 --> 03:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
their actual work in determining whether
 
03:15:43.550 --> 03:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
they're above or below the full full
 
03:15:46.189 --> 03:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
time requirement and we've kicked people
 
03:15:48.189 --> 03:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
out of the system fell below this Rule
 
03:15:50.389 --> 03:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
and we've required enrollment for people
 
03:15:53.110 --> 03:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
who fall above the rule rule and the
 
03:15:55.030 --> 03:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
rule is essentially and I shouldn't say
 
03:15:56.670 --> 03:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
rule it's not administrative rule it's a
 
03:15:59.349 --> 03:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
policy in an interpretive memorandum
 
03:16:02.630 --> 03:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
that was issued many years ago but it
 
03:16:02.640 --> 03:16:04.189 align:start position:0%
that was issued many years ago but it
says

03:16:04.189 --> 03:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
says
 
03:16:06.990 --> 03:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
that if we were for instance you show up
 
03:16:09.030 --> 03:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
an audit and we were to look and and the
 
03:16:10.590 --> 03:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
employee say Well they're
 
03:16:14.790 --> 03:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
part-time well show me their work hours
 
03:16:16.070 --> 03:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
and we would say okay we're going to
 
03:16:17.750 --> 03:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
look at your work hours over the last
 
03:16:21.389 --> 03:16:21.399 align:start position:0%
year Well despite you having a
 
03:16:23.389 --> 03:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
classification of part-time and a job
 
03:16:26.469 --> 03:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
description that says you work 32 hours
 
03:16:28.670 --> 03:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
a week the fact is over the last year
 
03:16:32.229 --> 03:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
you've worked 40 hours a week your
 
03:16:37.189 --> 03:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
fulltime and we're going to say it's um
 
03:16:37.199 --> 03:16:38.510 align:start position:0%
fulltime and we're going to say it's um
it's

03:16:38.510 --> 03:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:16:41.710 --> 03:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
uh a case of the facts over the form so
 
03:16:44.309 --> 03:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
to speak we're going to look at what in
 
03:16:47.030 --> 03:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
actuality happened we take an an
 
03:16:48.750 --> 03:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
employer's word for it say this is a
 
03:16:51.630 --> 03:16:51.640 align:start position:0%
part-time person they their their job
 
03:16:53.590 --> 03:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
description says they work X hours and
 
03:16:56.429 --> 03:16:56.439 align:start position:0%
that's below what is considered
 
03:16:59.750 --> 03:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
full-time for police is set by the
 
03:17:03.389 --> 03:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
employer same for fire um
 
03:17:07.150 --> 03:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
for um employees it's 35 for state
 
03:17:08.990 --> 03:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
employees it's 37 and a half for
 
03:17:12.790 --> 03:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
teachers it's just 30
 
03:17:16.070 --> 03:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
um but we found that notwithstanding the
 
03:17:17.950 --> 03:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
person's classific they were working
 
03:17:19.950 --> 03:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
more hours and we've had members come
 
03:17:21.830 --> 03:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
and say yeah you know I'm a part-time
 
03:17:26.110 --> 03:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
employee I'm a point a 0. n or a08
 
03:17:30.910 --> 03:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
teacher and 08 of the regular hours puts
 
03:17:33.910 --> 03:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
me below 30 but here they've asked me to
 
03:17:35.750 --> 03:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
fill in for this maternity leave and
 
03:17:38.469 --> 03:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
that maternity leave and and in fact
 
03:17:40.510 --> 03:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
over that school year I worked I
 
03:17:42.389 --> 03:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
averaged more than 30 hours and we just
 
03:17:45.469 --> 03:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
restored 5 months of service to someone
 
03:17:47.630 --> 03:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
after the employer had said said no
 
03:17:49.189 --> 03:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
they're part-time they're they're
 
03:17:52.030 --> 03:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
scheduled to work you know 27 hours a
 
03:17:53.950 --> 03:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
week and the person said that's not
 
03:17:56.269 --> 03:17:56.279 align:start position:0%
right I ended up because of filling in
 
03:17:58.070 --> 03:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
for people working more and she was able
 
03:18:01.110 --> 03:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
to prove that she appealed the the the
 
03:18:02.870 --> 03:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
the school was able to present their
 
03:18:05.870 --> 03:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
case uh and in the end the the the
 
03:18:08.309 --> 03:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
school district conceded that the
 
03:18:11.429 --> 03:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
actuality of her hours exceeded what her
 
03:18:13.670 --> 03:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
formal status was so that's a
 
03:18:16.389 --> 03:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
long-winded way of saying I just we just
 
03:18:19.110 --> 03:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
want to warn people that if over the
 
03:18:21.750 --> 03:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
long run the course of 6 months or a
 
03:18:23.349 --> 03:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
year the facts show that you're
 
03:18:25.990 --> 03:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
averaging more than what is
 
03:18:28.910 --> 03:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
fulltime we will restore you to service
 
03:18:31.189 --> 03:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
if we know about it knowing about it is
 
03:18:33.030 --> 03:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
a different question but you have to
 
03:18:35.110 --> 03:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
report those hours that's a secondary
 
03:18:36.630 --> 03:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
thing we're going to have to change our
 
03:18:39.550 --> 03:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
reporting system so that special duty is
 
03:18:41.990 --> 03:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
reported separately because this statute
 
03:18:44.550 --> 03:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
just says special Duty doesn't count it
 
03:18:46.229 --> 03:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't say they don't those hours don't
 
03:18:48.670 --> 03:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
have to be reported to us reporting is
 
03:18:53.030 --> 03:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
in RSA 100 a16 and the only work hours
 
03:18:55.670 --> 03:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
of retirees that are Exempted from that
 
03:18:58.910 --> 03:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
section are for elected officials so for
 
03:19:02.469 --> 03:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
instance BFFs and um court security
 
03:19:04.870 --> 03:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
officers are not subject to these annual
 
03:19:06.950 --> 03:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
limits but we still have their hours
 
03:19:09.710 --> 03:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
reported to us similarly we do not
 
03:19:12.389 --> 03:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
subject people who are in full-time
 
03:19:15.269 --> 03:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
optional positions like commissioners of
 
03:19:16.710 --> 03:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
certain departments officials of
 
03:19:19.110 --> 03:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
appointed to a fixed term who are not
 
03:19:21.070 --> 03:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
required to enroll in the system well it
 
03:19:22.750 --> 03:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
would be silly to say well you have a a
 
03:19:24.870 --> 03:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
limit on your worktime hours if you're
 
03:19:26.750 --> 03:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to work full-time and not be a
 
03:19:30.070 --> 03:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
member um so those exempt people still
 
03:19:32.070 --> 03:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
have their hours reported to us they're
 
03:19:34.150 --> 03:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
just flagged in our system as exempt so
 
03:19:36.590 --> 03:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
we don't try to assess them a penalty so
 
03:19:38.030 --> 03:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
these hours would still need to be
 
03:19:40.870 --> 03:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
reported To Us by the employer and so
 
03:19:41.870 --> 03:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to set up a
 
03:19:44.750 --> 03:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
bifurcated system for group twos where
 
03:19:47.429 --> 03:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
they could separately report and the
 
03:19:50.830 --> 03:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
last thing is is is a more of a uh kind
 
03:19:55.910 --> 03:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
of a a conceptual thing but um it might
 
03:19:58.830 --> 03:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
be possible that employers the number of
 
03:20:02.469 --> 03:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
full-time jobs might decrease if they
 
03:20:05.389 --> 03:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
could fill it with part-time so if I
 
03:20:07.510 --> 03:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
have someone who can work 39 hours a
 
03:20:09.790 --> 03:20:09.800 align:start position:0%
week and I don't have to pay him a
 
03:20:12.429 --> 03:20:12.439 align:start position:0%
pension pay pay pension contributions
 
03:20:14.189 --> 03:20:14.199 align:start position:0%
versus someone who works 40 hours a week
 
03:20:17.189 --> 03:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
I have to pay pension contributions and
 
03:20:18.510 --> 03:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
person can say I'm going to do way with
 
03:20:20.429 --> 03:20:20.439 align:start position:0%
that full-time position in hire a
 
03:20:23.469 --> 03:20:23.479 align:start position:0%
retiree who works 39 hours a week which
 
03:20:25.429 --> 03:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
was the State of Affairs before any of
 
03:20:28.510 --> 03:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
these work after retirement um
 
03:20:31.349 --> 03:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
requirements were put into place in 200
 
03:20:35.189 --> 03:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
I think it was 15 or 16
 
03:20:38.750 --> 03:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
um before that a retired police officer
 
03:20:42.710 --> 03:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
could work 39 hours a week in and uh one
 
03:20:44.710 --> 03:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
hour less than what's full-time and
 
03:20:47.469 --> 03:20:47.479 align:start position:0%
still retain their pension um this is
 
03:20:49.349 --> 03:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
essentially putting by not counting
 
03:20:51.269 --> 03:20:51.279 align:start position:0%
special Duty putting some people back
 
03:20:54.349 --> 03:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
into that position that uh everyone was
 
03:20:57.590 --> 03:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
in prior to even having restrictions on
 
03:21:00.469 --> 03:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
work after retirement uh with that I'd
 
03:21:02.269 --> 03:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
open it up for any
 
03:21:05.309 --> 03:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
03:21:07.830 --> 03:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
you with your
 
03:21:10.150 --> 03:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
permission because I'm a co-sponsor on
 
03:21:12.349 --> 03:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
this but there's been a question raised
 
03:21:14.550 --> 03:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
as to the tierc and I I think we need
 
03:21:17.229 --> 03:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
some clarification on the effect of the
 
03:21:17.239 --> 03:21:18.269 align:start position:0%
some clarification on the effect of the
TRC

03:21:18.269 --> 03:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
TRC
 
03:21:22.790 --> 03:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
folks um if that's all right that's okay
 
03:21:25.710 --> 03:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
would yes are new people need to know
 
03:21:30.309 --> 03:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
who who or what is tierc tierc means
 
03:21:35.830 --> 03:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:39.070 --> 03:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
after July 1st
 
03:21:41.670 --> 03:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
2011 so Mike my question in reference to
 
03:21:45.070 --> 03:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
the tierc folks is followup well that
 
03:21:47.710 --> 03:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't right you asked him that question
 
03:21:51.070 --> 03:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:21:55.269 --> 03:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
is because the tier C extra special duty
 
03:21:58.510 --> 03:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
hours do not count towards calculating
 
03:21:58.520 --> 03:21:59.710 align:start position:0%
hours do not count towards calculating
their

03:21:59.710 --> 03:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:22:03.070 --> 03:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
benefit right the compensation paid for
 
03:22:04.790 --> 03:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
those hours don't count does not count
 
03:22:08.750 --> 03:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
right because it does not
 
03:22:08.760 --> 03:22:10.510 align:start position:0%
right because it does not
count

03:22:10.510 --> 03:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
count
 
03:22:14.630 --> 03:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:17.590 --> 03:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
matter that that it in specific to the
 
03:22:20.349 --> 03:22:20.359 align:start position:0%
TRC folks why would it matter then what
 
03:22:23.469 --> 03:22:23.479 align:start position:0%
their ACR hours are in this particular
 
03:22:25.950 --> 03:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
case when they've never paid in under
 
03:22:28.910 --> 03:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
this category and they and they will and
 
03:22:31.469 --> 03:22:31.479 align:start position:0%
they receive no benefit for work that
 
03:22:34.150 --> 03:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
was conducted under this category um
 
03:22:37.030 --> 03:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
well it doesn't matter to me or to the
 
03:22:40.110 --> 03:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
system but you have two competing policy
 
03:22:42.630 --> 03:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
objectives that the committee has voted
 
03:22:47.189 --> 03:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
on and perhaps this issue is uh a time
 
03:22:49.510 --> 03:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
to reconcile how they're different one
 
03:22:53.349 --> 03:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
is are we going to allow exter special
 
03:22:56.429 --> 03:22:56.439 align:start position:0%
duty pay to be included in calculating
 
03:23:00.469 --> 03:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
the members benefit and I think the Poli
 
03:23:02.830 --> 03:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
policy decision was back in
 
03:23:06.710 --> 03:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
2011 when uh the definition was changed
 
03:23:09.229 --> 03:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
of earnable comp because there was a
 
03:23:10.830 --> 03:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
sense that a lot of people did a lot of
 
03:23:12.510 --> 03:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
special duty at the end so their High
 
03:23:14.030 --> 03:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
three years would be boosted up and
 
03:23:15.790 --> 03:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
their pension would be higher that was
 
03:23:18.429 --> 03:23:18.439 align:start position:0%
one policy consideration the second
 
03:23:20.469 --> 03:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
policy consideration
 
03:23:25.469 --> 03:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
was was it right or wrong to allow
 
03:23:28.950 --> 03:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
members to retire and continue to work
 
03:23:31.349 --> 03:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
at a level that's one hour short of
 
03:23:34.750 --> 03:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
fulltime and a decision was made on a
 
03:23:38.830 --> 03:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
policy basis um that there should be
 
03:23:41.510 --> 03:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
some restriction on the number of hours
 
03:23:44.349 --> 03:23:44.359 align:start position:0%
that a retiree can work once they've
 
03:23:46.269 --> 03:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
started to collect their benefit those
 
03:23:49.750 --> 03:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
are the two separate in competing policy
 
03:23:51.830 --> 03:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
considerations for the committee to
 
03:23:54.590 --> 03:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
reconcile I'm not saying one is good one
 
03:23:56.750 --> 03:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
is bad I'm saying the state of the law
 
03:24:01.990 --> 03:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
as it is requires a one result in the
 
03:24:04.110 --> 03:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
case of not counting the compensation
 
03:24:06.030 --> 03:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
because that's what the law says for
 
03:24:10.510 --> 03:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
tier C members and in the other side is
 
03:24:13.110 --> 03:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
the limitation on the annual hours two
 
03:24:15.229 --> 03:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
separate subjects there's a little bit
 
03:24:17.630 --> 03:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
of overlap here we don't take a point of
 
03:24:19.790 --> 03:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
view on it it's a policy decision for
 
03:24:21.630 --> 03:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
the committee to resolve amongst
 
03:24:24.710 --> 03:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
themselves thank you representative Lam
 
03:24:26.030 --> 03:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:24:28.429 --> 03:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
for being here to answer questions um
 
03:24:30.830 --> 03:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
with with what you had told us about how
 
03:24:32.830 --> 03:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
these extra and special Duty pays or
 
03:24:34.590 --> 03:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
sort of the equivalent within the group
 
03:24:37.469 --> 03:24:37.479 align:start position:0%
one employees can be used to the benefit
 
03:24:39.670 --> 03:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
of the employee so that they qualify for
 
03:24:41.950 --> 03:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
the retirement system would it be
 
03:24:45.070 --> 03:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
inconsistent then to ignore them after
 
03:24:48.429 --> 03:24:48.439 align:start position:0%
retirement to when it's at the benefit
 
03:24:50.750 --> 03:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
would that be an inconsistent opinion to
 
03:24:52.469 --> 03:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
say that those extra hours do count you
 
03:24:54.670 --> 03:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
to full- time in one case and they don't
 
03:24:56.510 --> 03:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
count you to fulltime and another I
 
03:24:58.269 --> 03:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
think that's a matter of opinion and
 
03:25:01.110 --> 03:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
policy that I don't have a position on
 
03:25:03.870 --> 03:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and nor does the system um I
 
03:25:08.910 --> 03:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
have a question sir the this bill just
 
03:25:14.349 --> 03:25:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:17.469 --> 03:25:17.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement oh does but it it is not
 
03:25:20.469 --> 03:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
restricted to group C there are I know
 
03:25:24.309 --> 03:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
there are some right middle group middle
 
03:25:27.030 --> 03:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
tier people who are still
 
03:25:29.510 --> 03:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
employed still in the retirements and I
 
03:25:32.670 --> 03:25:32.680 align:start position:0%
suspect there may be some older ones
 
03:25:32.680 --> 03:25:33.790 align:start position:0%
suspect there may be some older ones
from

03:25:33.790 --> 03:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:25:37.110 --> 03:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
group there are still some tier a as
 
03:25:42.269 --> 03:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
people who were vested as of um 112
 
03:25:43.670 --> 03:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
which meant they had at least 10 years
 
03:25:45.150 --> 03:25:45.160 align:start position:0%
service so that would have been someone
 
03:25:48.790 --> 03:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
hired in 200 to 23 years ago there
 
03:25:50.389 --> 03:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
there's there's quite a few police
 
03:25:52.830 --> 03:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
officers especially lieutenants and
 
03:25:54.870 --> 03:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
captains and Chiefs who was still
 
03:25:57.670 --> 03:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
working after 23 years and then there's
 
03:26:00.229 --> 03:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
tier B which were people who were hired
 
03:26:04.030 --> 03:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
before uh 71 11 but did not have 10
 
03:26:06.229 --> 03:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
years of service there's a lot of those
 
03:26:08.590 --> 03:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
left I don't know the exact number but
 
03:26:11.710 --> 03:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
it's around 1,600 and so for those two
 
03:26:15.269 --> 03:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
groups special Duty does Count Their pay
 
03:26:18.110 --> 03:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
does count towards calculation of their
 
03:26:20.630 --> 03:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
pension okay well that appears to me to
 
03:26:23.790 --> 03:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
be a flaw in the logic of this this bill
 
03:26:25.510 --> 03:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
because it
 
03:26:30.309 --> 03:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
should by their logic only apply to tier
 
03:26:33.590 --> 03:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
c um would you agree with that no that
 
03:26:36.550 --> 03:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
again that's a policy decision okay
 
03:26:38.269 --> 03:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between counting
 
03:26:40.349 --> 03:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
the compensation towards calculating the
 
03:26:42.469 --> 03:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
benefit versus counting the hours for
 
03:26:46.590 --> 03:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
the purposes of the limitation thank you
 
03:26:49.710 --> 03:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
all right representative
 
03:26:54.790 --> 03:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
BR so originally um we were we Define
 
03:26:57.030 --> 03:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
these hours of work so that there
 
03:26:57.040 --> 03:26:58.229 align:start position:0%
these hours of work so that there
wouldn't

03:26:58.229 --> 03:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
03:27:01.309 --> 03:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
be um someone who's
 
03:27:03.950 --> 03:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
retired come back to the
 
03:27:06.309 --> 03:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
workforce and
 
03:27:09.229 --> 03:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
work in
 
03:27:13.429 --> 03:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
a in a Time beyond what
 
03:27:13.439 --> 03:27:14.990 align:start position:0%
a in a Time beyond what
was

03:27:14.990 --> 03:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:27:16.670 --> 03:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
defined uh
 
03:27:19.630 --> 03:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
right person could work up to one hour
 
03:27:22.389 --> 03:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
less than what the hour the number of
 
03:27:24.870 --> 03:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
hours that would make mandatory
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
enrollment correct yeah so and that was
 
03:27:32.510 --> 03:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there was an abuse of
 
03:27:36.110 --> 03:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
the system or maybe that's something
 
03:27:38.030 --> 03:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about in committee
 
03:27:43.110 --> 03:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
but this would make that those
 
03:27:45.590 --> 03:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
hours it would allow the expansion of
 
03:27:48.309 --> 03:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:51.389 --> 03:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
up up to one hour less than or or
 
03:27:53.510 --> 03:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
theoretically one minute less than what
 
03:27:56.469 --> 03:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
is fulltime for for group twos okay
 
03:27:58.189 --> 03:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:28:00.910 --> 03:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
okay interesting thank you very much are
 
03:28:02.870 --> 03:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
there other
 
03:28:04.710 --> 03:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your time all
 
03:28:06.830 --> 03:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
right excuse me representative citec has
 
03:28:10.670 --> 03:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
a question yes sir Mr Kev you've you've
 
03:28:13.389 --> 03:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
given a lot of examples I wonder just
 
03:28:15.269 --> 03:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
how many people are affected but let's
 
03:28:18.990 --> 03:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
get back to T sa you said somebody um
 
03:28:24.349 --> 03:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
riding in a patrol car uh if he works 40
 
03:28:28.110 --> 03:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
hours a week right now tier C let's
 
03:28:31.710 --> 03:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
let's confine this to tier C if he works
 
03:28:34.990 --> 03:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
if he's riding 40 hours in a patrol car
 
03:28:38.510 --> 03:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
and does traffic Duty unrelated to his
 
03:28:41.110 --> 03:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
core job that doesn't
 
03:28:43.790 --> 03:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
count we you're right we would not count
 
03:28:45.830 --> 03:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
the compensation nor would contributions
 
03:28:48.790 --> 03:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
be paid on that contribution on that
 
03:28:51.229 --> 03:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
compensation I want to go back to my
 
03:28:53.269 --> 03:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
First Fundamental question because I
 
03:28:56.830 --> 03:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
haven't seen how how that how you've
 
03:29:01.510 --> 03:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
addressed that why that same person
 
03:29:04.389 --> 03:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
retired those hours are not part of the
 
03:29:06.590 --> 03:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
system they didn't count he got paid for
 
03:29:08.189 --> 03:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
it as if he were working at Dunkin
 
03:29:12.830 --> 03:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
Donuts for that matter so if you're to
 
03:29:15.229 --> 03:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
unless this is some kind of end run
 
03:29:18.110 --> 03:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
where he works 26 hours core and then
 
03:29:21.349 --> 03:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
pretends that the other hours are
 
03:29:23.830 --> 03:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
special duty but he's really doing the
 
03:29:27.150 --> 03:29:27.160 align:start position:0%
same job I can see that as an abuse but
 
03:29:30.110 --> 03:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
if he's doing special
 
03:29:33.950 --> 03:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
hours what it just doesn't seem to it is
 
03:29:36.469 --> 03:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
not and it doesn't seem it isn't
 
03:29:40.070 --> 03:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
consistent that it's okay it doesn't
 
03:29:43.189 --> 03:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
apply to his retirement before while
 
03:29:46.590 --> 03:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
he's working extra hours toce
 
03:29:49.790 --> 03:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
fulltime why those hours after
 
03:29:53.110 --> 03:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
retirement should have the similar sum
 
03:29:54.790 --> 03:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
effect on his retirement they didn't
 
03:29:57.070 --> 03:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
before why should they
 
03:29:59.670 --> 03:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
after well I don't ask should questions
 
03:30:01.150 --> 03:30:01.160 align:start position:0%
those are policies what should or
 
03:30:03.030 --> 03:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't happen is in the purview of
 
03:30:04.469 --> 03:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
the committee I don't have an opinion on
 
03:30:06.990 --> 03:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
that you're you're excuse me leaving the
 
03:30:09.110 --> 03:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
question you're leaving that up to us
 
03:30:11.309 --> 03:30:11.319 align:start position:0%
correct as I should thank you thank you
 
03:30:14.429 --> 03:30:14.439 align:start position:0%
represent LE um thank you madam chair um
 
03:30:17.030 --> 03:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
right now if there's a patrol who is in
 
03:30:19.630 --> 03:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
a role where there's a 40-hour work week
 
03:30:21.870 --> 03:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
and they're working 32 hours in their
 
03:30:25.429 --> 03:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
normal Duty um as a patrolman and then
 
03:30:28.030 --> 03:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
they add another 10 10 hours average in
 
03:30:30.790 --> 03:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
the extra and special duty pay is it
 
03:30:33.349 --> 03:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
true that those dollars don't go towards
 
03:30:35.510 --> 03:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
the retirement system but the fact that
 
03:30:37.950 --> 03:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
his regular pay regular duty hours plus
 
03:30:40.910 --> 03:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
the extra and special Duty add up to 42
 
03:30:43.229 --> 03:30:43.239 align:start position:0%
which is over fulltime qualifies him for
 
03:30:45.389 --> 03:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
the retirement system when he would not
 
03:30:45.399 --> 03:30:46.910 align:start position:0%
the retirement system when he would not
otherwise

03:30:46.910 --> 03:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
03:30:48.870 --> 03:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
qualified well it's a a good
 
03:30:51.030 --> 03:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
hypothetical question we haven't faced
 
03:30:53.469 --> 03:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
it we've had no TRC members this
 
03:30:55.550 --> 03:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
situation I described with the prison
 
03:31:00.070 --> 03:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
transports was unique to straford County
 
03:31:01.990 --> 03:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh and their Deputy
 
03:31:04.550 --> 03:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
sheriffs uh when they raised the issue
 
03:31:06.950 --> 03:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
that I'm being assigned to prison
 
03:31:09.070 --> 03:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
transport two and three hours a week and
 
03:31:10.630 --> 03:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
then I'm working 40 hours the same as
 
03:31:13.469 --> 03:31:13.479 align:start position:0%
everyone else but I I only have regular
 
03:31:16.189 --> 03:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
hours that are less than what allow me
 
03:31:18.750 --> 03:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
to be enrolled so it was a unique
 
03:31:21.110 --> 03:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
decision I think if your hypothetical
 
03:31:22.710 --> 03:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
were to come up there would be some
 
03:31:25.550 --> 03:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
serious thought about um what the proper
 
03:31:28.349 --> 03:31:28.359 align:start position:0%
way to handle that was if that's any
 
03:31:30.950 --> 03:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
guidance to you folks and making your
 
03:31:30.960 --> 03:31:32.389 align:start position:0%
guidance to you folks and making your
policy

03:31:32.389 --> 03:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
policy
 
03:31:34.910 --> 03:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
decisions thank you that just just to
 
03:31:36.830 --> 03:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
note Madam chair that a representative
 
03:31:38.910 --> 03:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
PE to you a tierc employee is not
 
03:31:41.710 --> 03:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
eligible to retire the very first one is
 
03:31:44.630 --> 03:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
not eligible to retire until
 
03:31:48.030 --> 03:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
2036 then this bill is to is only for
 
03:31:50.510 --> 03:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
the tier A and
 
03:31:53.830 --> 03:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
B retirees who
 
03:31:57.429 --> 03:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
are whose special Duty does count to
 
03:31:59.389 --> 03:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
toward did count toward that would be a
 
03:32:06.229 --> 03:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:09.229 --> 03:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
you anything further no thank you very
 
03:32:14.389 --> 03:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:16.750 --> 03:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
useful all right
 
03:32:16.760 --> 03:32:24.590 align:start position:0%
useful all right
Michael

03:32:24.590 --> 03:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:28.189 --> 03:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
G good afternoon Madam chair honorable
 
03:32:29.670 --> 03:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
03:32:31.269 --> 03:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
Michael gear and I'm the New Hampshire
 
03:32:33.710 --> 03:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
Police Association president I'm here
 
03:32:36.309 --> 03:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
today to express my strong support for
 
03:32:40.070 --> 03:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
HB 702 which seeks to exclude extra duty
 
03:32:43.349 --> 03:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
hours commonly referred to as details
 
03:32:45.150 --> 03:32:45.160 align:start position:0%
from the yearly calculation of hours
 
03:32:47.950 --> 03:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
worked for retired part-time police
 
03:32:50.630 --> 03:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
officers as you may know retired
 
03:32:52.590 --> 03:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
part-time officers often continue to
 
03:32:55.750 --> 03:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
serve their communities in various
 
03:32:58.189 --> 03:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
capacities however under current
 
03:33:00.189 --> 03:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
regulations their outside Detail hours
 
03:33:01.830 --> 03:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
are counted against their yearly
 
03:33:01.840 --> 03:33:03.830 align:start position:0%
are counted against their yearly
allotted

03:33:03.830 --> 03:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
allotted
 
03:33:06.510 --> 03:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
hours it should be noted details worked
 
03:33:08.710 --> 03:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
are not paid for by the local community
 
03:33:11.590 --> 03:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
they're paid for by the local
 
03:33:13.990 --> 03:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
contractor this practice can result in
 
03:33:16.110 --> 03:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
unnecessary restrictions on the time
 
03:33:18.550 --> 03:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
officers ability to continue to serve
 
03:33:21.950 --> 03:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
their Community within a calendar year
 
03:33:23.990 --> 03:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's essential to note that there is no
 
03:33:25.990 --> 03:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement for the retirement
 
03:33:28.750 --> 03:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
system to include extra duty pay in the
 
03:33:31.030 --> 03:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
calculation of an officer's retirement
 
03:33:34.070 --> 03:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
benefits furthermore details or extra
 
03:33:36.510 --> 03:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
duty pay are no longer considered when
 
03:33:39.229 --> 03:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
calculating an officer's retirement
 
03:33:41.910 --> 03:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
benefits considering this it is only
 
03:33:43.950 --> 03:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
logical that these hours should not be
 
03:33:45.870 --> 03:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
counted against a retired parttime
 
03:33:47.990 --> 03:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
officers yearly allotted hours this
 
03:33:50.070 --> 03:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
change would not only be fair but also
 
03:33:52.510 --> 03:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
provide more flexibility for these
 
03:33:53.990 --> 03:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated public
 
03:33:56.389 --> 03:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
servants the benefits of this bill are
 
03:33:59.030 --> 03:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
twofold first it would allow retired
 
03:34:00.950 --> 03:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
part-time officers to continue serving
 
03:34:02.910 --> 03:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
their communities without facing
 
03:34:05.990 --> 03:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary restrictions second it would
 
03:34:07.750 --> 03:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
allow local police departments to
 
03:34:10.309 --> 03:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
confidently rely on these officers to
 
03:34:13.830 --> 03:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
perform outside details if needed and
 
03:34:16.189 --> 03:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
necessary I want to emphasize that this
 
03:34:18.469 --> 03:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
bill comes at no cost to the state or
 
03:34:20.510 --> 03:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers it is a common sense
 
03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
adjustment that would have a positive
 
03:34:24.750 --> 03:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
impact on the local police
 
03:34:26.990 --> 03:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
departments our retired part-time
 
03:34:29.389 --> 03:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
officers have dedicated their lives to
 
03:34:31.950 --> 03:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
serving and protecting our communities I
 
03:34:35.110 --> 03:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
urge you to support 702 thank you for
 
03:34:36.910 --> 03:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
considering my testimony I'm happy to
 
03:34:38.550 --> 03:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you
 
03:34:41.110 --> 03:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
representative re has a question thank
 
03:34:43.750 --> 03:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
you and I'm sorry your your title what
 
03:34:45.830 --> 03:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
am I supposed to call you again was it
 
03:34:47.389 --> 03:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Police Association
 
03:34:48.870 --> 03:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
president I'm also a detective with the
 
03:34:50.590 --> 03:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
Salem New Hampshire police detective
 
03:34:52.110 --> 03:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
then okay thank you very much detective
 
03:34:54.030 --> 03:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
I sorry didn't hear that earlier uh
 
03:34:57.389 --> 03:34:57.399 align:start position:0%
follow question thank you um I come from
 
03:35:00.510 --> 03:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
Hampton uh I'm knew this this term we
 
03:35:03.150 --> 03:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
have a significant problem in our town
 
03:35:05.830 --> 03:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
during the Summers attracting part-time
 
03:35:09.229 --> 03:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
police officers um and many many many
 
03:35:12.269 --> 03:35:12.279 align:start position:0%
positions go unfilled uh which then
 
03:35:14.870 --> 03:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
causes our full-time officers to have to
 
03:35:16.349 --> 03:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
work over time
 
03:35:18.790 --> 03:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
um if this bill were to pass would we
 
03:35:21.229 --> 03:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
have a hard would we find ourselves in a
 
03:35:23.710 --> 03:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
position in my town of Hampton during
 
03:35:26.670 --> 03:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
the Summers would we find it easier to
 
03:35:29.710 --> 03:35:29.720 align:start position:0%
hire retired part-time officers to fill
 
03:35:32.910 --> 03:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
those shifts thank you thank you for the
 
03:35:35.429 --> 03:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
question so in my humble opinion
 
03:35:37.750 --> 03:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
whatever you're hiring in Hampton
 
03:35:40.830 --> 03:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
there's two folds to this one if it was
 
03:35:43.469 --> 03:35:43.479 align:start position:0%
paid for by the town of Hampton that
 
03:35:46.150 --> 03:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
could actually count towards what the
 
03:35:48.670 --> 03:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
full-time officer is paying however if
 
03:35:51.990 --> 03:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
your local bar is paying a bill for the
 
03:35:54.950 --> 03:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
police officer to be present that's
 
03:35:57.670 --> 03:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
considered a detail uh Duty that will
 
03:36:00.030 --> 03:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
not be paid for by the town because it's
 
03:36:03.070 --> 03:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
a an extra Duty that a regular full-time
 
03:36:04.150 --> 03:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
police officer that would be
 
03:36:06.389 --> 03:36:06.399 align:start position:0%
contributing to the retirement however a
 
03:36:08.750 --> 03:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
part-time officer those hours should be
 
03:36:13.910 --> 03:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:17.309 --> 03:36:17.319 align:start position:0%
welcome all right
 
03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
I have one Madam chair if you're yes
 
03:36:21.469 --> 03:36:21.479 align:start position:0%
searching um there was some discussion
 
03:36:26.389 --> 03:36:26.399 align:start position:0%
about um officers working say a 32 hours
 
03:36:29.189 --> 03:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
and then using eight hours of of detail
 
03:36:33.110 --> 03:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
pay or to get them to 40 I know in in
 
03:36:35.110 --> 03:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
the fire service side of that that's not
 
03:36:36.590 --> 03:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
how things work and I don't think it
 
03:36:37.950 --> 03:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
works that way in your Universe either
 
03:36:39.750 --> 03:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
if you're going to be a full-time cop
 
03:36:41.429 --> 03:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
you're working 40 hours full-time
 
03:36:42.710 --> 03:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
correct and these and I just want to
 
03:36:44.830 --> 03:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that that's clear to the
 
03:36:46.630 --> 03:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
committee that my understanding is
 
03:36:49.750 --> 03:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
correct at least if I'm that this is
 
03:36:52.349 --> 03:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
those hours on the extra and special are
 
03:36:55.349 --> 03:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
not what makes you become full-time
 
03:36:58.269 --> 03:36:58.279 align:start position:0%
correct correct um full-time police
 
03:37:00.950 --> 03:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
officer has to work 40 hours a week
 
03:37:02.630 --> 03:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes they pick up extra details
 
03:37:05.309 --> 03:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
when it's available we rely heavily on
 
03:37:07.670 --> 03:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
our part-time offices especially during
 
03:37:10.830 --> 03:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
the summer uh the holidays uh however
 
03:37:12.750 --> 03:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
they run out of hours because the detail
 
03:37:15.830 --> 03:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
hours that they're working a security
 
03:37:18.510 --> 03:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
detail it's actually being taken out out
 
03:37:21.469 --> 03:37:21.479 align:start position:0%
of their um allotted hours for the whole
 
03:37:24.349 --> 03:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
year so it's probably best and it's
 
03:37:26.990 --> 03:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
beneficial if we separate those hours
 
03:37:31.269 --> 03:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
from town time paid for by the town or
 
03:37:34.670 --> 03:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
reg uh detailed uh time paid for by the
 
03:37:37.550 --> 03:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
contractor or a special
 
03:37:40.550 --> 03:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
Duty thank you for that other questions
 
03:37:40.560 --> 03:37:41.870 align:start position:0%
Duty thank you for that other questions
representative

03:37:41.870 --> 03:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:37:45.750 --> 03:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair so I
 
03:37:48.070 --> 03:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
thought one of the concerns was not
 
03:37:50.070 --> 03:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
you've emphasized several times in your
 
03:37:53.110 --> 03:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
testimony that the the the payment is
 
03:37:56.429 --> 03:37:56.439 align:start position:0%
not coming out of the public pocket it's
 
03:37:59.950 --> 03:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
coming out of the private entities need
 
03:38:02.790 --> 03:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
for service but I thought one of the
 
03:38:06.349 --> 03:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
concerns was not so much that aspect but
 
03:38:08.670 --> 03:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
the fact that here they are basically
 
03:38:11.990 --> 03:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
working fulltime but but no
 
03:38:14.389 --> 03:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
money not the appropriate amount of
 
03:38:17.950 --> 03:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
money anyway is coming uh is going into
 
03:38:17.960 --> 03:38:19.950 align:start position:0%
money anyway is coming uh is going into
the

03:38:19.950 --> 03:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:38:24.630 --> 03:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
nhrs thank you for that um so and again
 
03:38:27.229 --> 03:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
if it's a small town that's providing
 
03:38:29.110 --> 03:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
the service a parttime officer providing
 
03:38:32.150 --> 03:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
the service for a smaller town again the
 
03:38:34.189 --> 03:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
pay if he's working or she's working a
 
03:38:37.229 --> 03:38:37.239 align:start position:0%
patrol shift that's actually could be
 
03:38:38.990 --> 03:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
considered a payment towards the New
 
03:38:41.349 --> 03:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system however a
 
03:38:44.229 --> 03:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
police officer today which is TSC those
 
03:38:45.910 --> 03:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
officers did not contributing Detail
 
03:38:47.309 --> 03:38:47.319 align:start position:0%
hours they're not contributing to the
 
03:38:49.590 --> 03:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
retirement system however we're almost
 
03:38:52.150 --> 03:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
like penalizing the part-time officers
 
03:38:55.189 --> 03:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
for wanting to work and being out there
 
03:38:57.670 --> 03:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
providing that service that a full-time
 
03:39:00.269 --> 03:39:00.279 align:start position:0%
officer doesn't want to
 
03:39:03.630 --> 03:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
work thank you thank you other questions
 
03:39:05.990 --> 03:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank
 
03:39:08.550 --> 03:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:39:13.070 --> 03:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:17.389 --> 03:39:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:19.469 --> 03:39:19.479 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I will close the
 
03:39:19.479 --> 03:39:20.309 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I will close the
public

03:39:20.309 --> 03:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:39:22.870 --> 03:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
hearing I believe this bill will go to
 
03:39:25.710 --> 03:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
the pension subcommittee for further
 
03:39:32.229 --> 03:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:35.910 --> 03:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
decisions sure um thank you madam chair
 
03:39:37.910 --> 03:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to make it clear that
 
03:39:39.349 --> 03:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
some of the questions I'm asking are
 
03:39:41.389 --> 03:39:41.399 align:start position:0%
clarifying because so many of us are new
 
03:39:43.469 --> 03:39:43.479 align:start position:0%
to the committee and a lot of times the
 
03:39:44.870 --> 03:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
people who are here as experts are
 
03:39:47.150 --> 03:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
answering these questions well for us I
 
03:39:48.510 --> 03:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that I'm tying up
 
03:39:50.630 --> 03:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
whatever loose ends I see so that we can
 
03:39:52.429 --> 03:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
all get up to speed and really be doing
 
03:39:54.670 --> 03:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
a good job as quickly as possible so
 
03:39:56.030 --> 03:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
when they've been answered by somebody
 
03:39:57.269 --> 03:39:57.279 align:start position:0%
it's helpful we already have that
 
03:40:14.309 --> 03:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:18.550 --> 03:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
you have you talk
 
03:40:21.070 --> 03:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
support I don't know if you heard no
 
03:40:24.070 --> 03:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:27.189 --> 03:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
stay I don't know if you heard he said
 
03:40:29.189 --> 03:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
the complication of keeping these hours
 
03:40:31.510 --> 03:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
separate and I thought to myself wanted
 
03:40:33.990 --> 03:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
to say well representative Schmid's in
 
03:40:37.429 --> 03:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:41.030 --> 03:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
teachers attendance bonus would count
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
you were able to count those weren't
 
03:40:46.070 --> 03:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
you to
 
03:40:48.630 --> 03:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
because he was making the case at one
 
03:40:48.640 --> 03:40:50.429 align:start position:0%
because he was making the case at one
point

03:40:50.429 --> 03:40:50.439 align:start position:0%

03:53:35.469 --> 03:53:35.479 align:start position:0%
be all right I'm opening the hearing on
 
03:53:36.830 --> 03:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:53:39.670 --> 03:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
727 and I'm calling on representative
 
03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
Pearson to introduce the bill since he
 
03:53:43.590 --> 03:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
has said he is willing to answer
 
03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
questions well yeah thank you madam
 
03:53:47.990 --> 03:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
chair for the record um Representative
 
03:53:49.830 --> 03:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
Steve Pearson Rockingham District 13
 
03:53:52.469 --> 03:53:52.479 align:start position:0%
which encompasses the town of dairy um
 
03:53:54.630 --> 03:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to introduce this on behalf of
 
03:53:57.630 --> 03:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
Representative foot uh he's currently
 
03:54:00.110 --> 03:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
upstairs in uh committee
 
03:54:03.229 --> 03:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
Services um acquiring an amendment that
 
03:54:05.469 --> 03:54:05.479 align:start position:0%
was supposed to we were told was going
 
03:54:07.910 --> 03:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
to come down here and be ready so um in
 
03:54:09.189 --> 03:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
the interest of getting things going
 
03:54:11.389 --> 03:54:11.399 align:start position:0%
forward i' be happy to do that house
 
03:54:15.309 --> 03:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
bill 727 is uh
 
03:54:17.189 --> 03:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily similar to House Bill
 
03:54:19.910 --> 03:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
436 from last term which went through
 
03:54:22.429 --> 03:54:22.439 align:start position:0%
the house with a veto proof majority uh
 
03:54:25.429 --> 03:54:25.439 align:start position:0%
was inserted into the budget and was
 
03:54:28.990 --> 03:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
subsequently removed by the
 
03:54:34.189 --> 03:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
Senate um the overall encompassing
 
03:54:37.950 --> 03:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
reasoning for the bill is to address
 
03:54:42.830 --> 03:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:51.349 --> 03:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:56.149 --> 03:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:59.269 --> 03:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
trees the like I all right so yeah so
 
03:55:01.630 --> 03:55:01.640 align:start position:0%
the the the purpose the purpose of that
 
03:55:04.870 --> 03:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
of this um is to address changes that
 
03:55:06.510 --> 03:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
were made retroactively to the group two
 
03:55:09.070 --> 03:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
pension system in
 
03:55:11.750 --> 03:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
2011 the rewrite
 
03:55:15.030 --> 03:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment um that is hot off the presses
 
03:55:18.309 --> 03:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
here which which we should pass out yeah
 
03:55:22.349 --> 03:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
um just is the result
 
03:55:25.870 --> 03:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
of uh a stakeholders meeting that
 
03:55:30.710 --> 03:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
occurred um just to to clarify some
 
03:55:35.389 --> 03:55:35.399 align:start position:0%
language uh that that uh exists now as
 
03:55:37.469 --> 03:55:37.479 align:start position:0%
you know at when two years of time
 
03:55:40.349 --> 03:55:40.359 align:start position:0%
transpires and you have a bill that has
 
03:55:43.149 --> 03:55:43.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of dates in it dates have to be
 
03:55:45.429 --> 03:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
wiggled and adjusted
 
03:55:50.590 --> 03:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
in order for things to work um and you
 
03:55:52.870 --> 03:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
know there was a couple of policy
 
03:55:56.110 --> 03:55:56.120 align:start position:0%
tweaks this this
 
03:56:00.590 --> 03:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
is this is not right this is the wrong
 
03:56:04.710 --> 03:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
one she get she printed off the one that
 
03:56:08.990 --> 03:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
you already had yeah yeah so this this a
 
03:56:17.349 --> 03:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:19.229 --> 03:56:19.239 align:start position:0%
but anyway I'm more than happy
 
03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of of that I'm more than
 
03:56:23.790 --> 03:56:23.800 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any sort of questions
 
03:56:25.830 --> 03:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
anybody has as far as technical what do
 
03:56:27.550 --> 03:56:27.560 align:start position:0%
we do it's not the right Amendment
 
03:56:33.189 --> 03:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:35.990 --> 03:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so as far as far as the committee's
 
03:56:36.000 --> 03:56:37.590 align:start position:0%
yeah so as far as far as the committee's
questions

03:56:37.590 --> 03:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:56:40.790 --> 03:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
go we can I'm certainly happy to talk
 
03:56:42.990 --> 03:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
about any historical aspects any sort of
 
03:56:44.830 --> 03:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
technical questions any sort of
 
03:56:47.309 --> 03:56:47.319 align:start position:0%
reasoning as to why something is the way
 
03:56:50.630 --> 03:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
it is but the as I said before the
 
03:56:54.429 --> 03:56:54.439 align:start position:0%
intention here is to is to
 
03:56:57.670 --> 03:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
return some some not all some of the
 
03:57:00.149 --> 03:57:00.159 align:start position:0%
benefits that were taken away in
 
03:57:03.429 --> 03:57:03.439 align:start position:0%
2011 this does not enact a new
 
03:57:07.870 --> 03:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
benefit at all there are no new benefits
 
03:57:10.630 --> 03:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
that are being created from this this is
 
03:57:15.550 --> 03:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
just in reference to changes from 20
 
03:57:22.269 --> 03:57:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:25.269 --> 03:57:25.279 align:start position:0%
question thank you so maybe I
 
03:57:27.389 --> 03:57:27.399 align:start position:0%
misunderstood you but I thought you said
 
03:57:28.670 --> 03:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:57:31.630 --> 03:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
727 was exactly was very similar to
 
03:57:34.870 --> 03:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 436 extremely similar okay so
 
03:57:37.630 --> 03:57:37.640 align:start position:0%
and the so that's fine I do
 
03:57:41.070 --> 03:57:41.080 align:start position:0%
remember with the clarity House Bill 436
 
03:57:42.710 --> 03:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
since it spent so much time in this
 
03:57:44.870 --> 03:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
committee last year
 
03:57:48.110 --> 03:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
why then what would the amendment
 
03:57:51.630 --> 03:57:51.640 align:start position:0%
do why are we not going forth with this
 
03:57:53.910 --> 03:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
bill uh this when this was initially
 
03:57:55.790 --> 03:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
filed remember the filing period was way
 
03:57:58.870 --> 03:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
back this was filed in oh my God
 
03:58:01.630 --> 03:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
September right so since that time
 
03:58:02.990 --> 03:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
period there have been a couple of
 
03:58:04.790 --> 03:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
things that have changed we elected a
 
03:58:04.800 --> 03:58:05.670 align:start position:0%
things that have changed we elected a
new

03:58:05.670 --> 03:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
new
 
03:58:09.309 --> 03:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
governor we had some stakeholder wiggle
 
03:58:12.110 --> 03:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
arounds with some folks involved in
 
03:58:15.349 --> 03:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
representing their various groups and
 
03:58:19.110 --> 03:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
after this filing occurred a there were
 
03:58:21.670 --> 03:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
stakeholder meetings that occurred to
 
03:58:24.469 --> 03:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
for them to discuss some of the
 
03:58:26.590 --> 03:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
concessions that occurred in House Bill
 
03:58:26.600 --> 03:58:29.670 align:start position:0%
concessions that occurred in House Bill
40

03:58:29.670 --> 03:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:35.149 --> 03:58:35.159 align:start position:0%
436 right because House Bill 436 as as
 
03:58:38.070 --> 03:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
well as House Bill 727 has concessions
 
03:58:40.110 --> 03:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
in it it is not a full
 
03:58:43.389 --> 03:58:43.399 align:start position:0%
restoration so the the stakeholder
 
03:58:43.399 --> 03:58:46.149 align:start position:0%
restoration so the the stakeholder
groups

03:58:46.149 --> 03:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:48.990 --> 03:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
amongst themselves discussed their
 
03:58:52.269 --> 03:58:52.279 align:start position:0%
desire and willingness to agree to
 
03:58:52.279 --> 03:58:54.990 align:start position:0%
desire and willingness to agree to
certain

03:58:54.990 --> 03:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:55.000 --> 03:58:57.189 align:start position:0%
 
concessions

03:58:57.189 --> 03:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
concessions
 
03:59:01.429 --> 03:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
followup so are you saying then um the
 
03:59:05.710 --> 03:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
amendment takes what was in 427 which is
 
03:59:08.469 --> 03:59:08.479 align:start position:0%
what it was in
 
03:59:08.479 --> 03:59:10.830 align:start position:0%
what it was in
436

03:59:10.830 --> 03:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
436
 
03:59:14.229 --> 03:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
and reduces the concessions returns it
 
03:59:16.110 --> 03:59:16.120 align:start position:0%
more to what it was like before correct
 
03:59:19.510 --> 03:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
it returns it a little bit more to its
 
03:59:22.910 --> 03:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
original if you will the purist concept
 
03:59:24.750 --> 03:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
of of a full and complete restoration
 
03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
which is actually impossible now because
 
03:59:29.389 --> 03:59:29.399 align:start position:0%
so much time has transpired from this if
 
03:59:30.710 --> 03:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
this had been
 
03:59:34.790 --> 03:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:37.990 --> 03:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
ago that you could have in
 
03:59:40.750 --> 03:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
theory restored everything but because
 
03:59:43.830 --> 03:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
of the progression of time now folks
 
03:59:46.590 --> 03:59:46.600 align:start position:0%
that are in group two have been forced
 
03:59:50.030 --> 03:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
to work additional years simply because
 
03:59:51.630 --> 03:59:51.640 align:start position:0%
time has progressed and this hasn't been
 
03:59:51.640 --> 03:59:53.790 align:start position:0%
time has progressed and this hasn't been
fixed

03:59:53.790 --> 03:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
fixed
 
03:59:56.630 --> 03:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
yet that's a huge concession when you
 
03:59:59.830 --> 03:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
when you prohibit someone's ability to
 
04:00:02.910 --> 04:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
retire and force them to to work longer
 
04:00:05.309 --> 04:00:05.319 align:start position:0%
that is a substantial concession so and
 
04:00:06.870 --> 04:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
that has just happened due to the nature
 
04:00:14.750 --> 04:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:17.510 --> 04:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
so last year when we were talking about
 
04:00:19.229 --> 04:00:19.239 align:start position:0%
this we had
 
04:00:22.110 --> 04:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
a some sort of committee I don't
 
04:00:24.429 --> 04:00:24.439 align:start position:0%
remember the name of it but it had
 
04:00:26.229 --> 04:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
members of the senate members of the
 
04:00:28.790 --> 04:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
house I believe represent our chair was
 
04:00:31.149 --> 04:00:31.159 align:start position:0%
on that committee correct as long along
 
04:00:32.269 --> 04:00:32.279 align:start position:0%
with state
 
04:00:35.030 --> 04:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Jeff goalie and I
 
04:00:36.910 --> 04:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
recognized some of the gentlemen in the
 
04:00:39.269 --> 04:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
back of the room they were also on that
 
04:00:41.830 --> 04:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
was a commission yes it was a commission
 
04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
and is that what
 
04:00:46.510 --> 04:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
is that what that thing that we all
 
04:00:48.149 --> 04:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
agreed on because I remember Senator
 
04:00:51.389 --> 04:00:51.399 align:start position:0%
gray and Senator Bradley negotiating
 
04:00:54.630 --> 04:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
back and forth so we ended up with
 
04:00:57.750 --> 04:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
something and are you saying that that
 
04:01:00.429 --> 04:01:00.439 align:start position:0%
something was not was killed in the
 
04:01:01.990 --> 04:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
house was killed in the Senate is that
 
04:01:03.550 --> 04:01:03.560 align:start position:0%
what you're saying because I no that is
 
04:01:06.429 --> 04:01:06.439 align:start position:0%
not what I'm saying okay so H Bill 436
 
04:01:08.070 --> 04:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
when it went through the process two
 
04:01:08.080 --> 04:01:09.110 align:start position:0%
when it went through the process two
years

04:01:09.110 --> 04:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:01:12.950 --> 04:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
ago it was inserted into the budget this
 
04:01:15.149 --> 04:01:15.159 align:start position:0%
is two years ago during the normal
 
04:01:17.550 --> 04:01:17.560 align:start position:0%
budget process it went through passed
 
04:01:19.349 --> 04:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
the house was inserted into the budget
 
04:01:20.590 --> 04:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
went over to the Senate the Senate
 
04:01:24.910 --> 04:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
removed it from the budget that was all
 
04:01:27.830 --> 04:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
exactly two years ago like right now the
 
04:01:30.469 --> 04:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
over the summer what they did was a
 
04:01:33.030 --> 04:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
commission was set up to look not at the
 
04:01:35.870 --> 04:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
holistic problem but parts of the
 
04:01:38.469 --> 04:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
problem and that summer commission and
 
04:01:39.910 --> 04:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
you are correct there are people in this
 
04:01:41.790 --> 04:01:41.800 align:start position:0%
room that were on that summer commission
 
04:01:44.990 --> 04:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
that commission came up with
 
04:01:49.269 --> 04:01:49.279 align:start position:0%
some ideas that were bits and pieces
 
04:01:51.349 --> 04:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
that were potentially
 
04:01:55.550 --> 04:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
doable for that moment in time okay and
 
04:01:57.590 --> 04:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
as with all
 
04:02:00.269 --> 04:02:00.279 align:start position:0%
commissions commissions issue majority
 
04:02:03.269 --> 04:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
reports they issue minority reports this
 
04:02:05.870 --> 04:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
entire mess that we're in right now came
 
04:02:07.830 --> 04:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
out of a Minority
 
04:02:10.790 --> 04:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
Report so you have to be careful when it
 
04:02:12.790 --> 04:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
comes to the way commissions work
 
04:02:15.510 --> 04:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
because people will pull things out of a
 
04:02:17.910 --> 04:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
commission Bring It Forward and say hey
 
04:02:19.950 --> 04:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
this is from the commission when in
 
04:02:21.910 --> 04:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
reality it's from The Minority Report of
 
04:02:23.309 --> 04:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
a commission
 
04:02:26.469 --> 04:02:26.479 align:start position:0%
so that what happened last Su over the
 
04:02:29.229 --> 04:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
summer was was well after the budget
 
04:02:31.590 --> 04:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
process and in and did not it was not a
 
04:02:35.870 --> 04:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
holistic view so so don't confuse the
 
04:02:39.149 --> 04:02:39.159 align:start position:0%
two events um as they're not they don't
 
04:02:43.110 --> 04:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
equate to each other followup so what
 
04:02:45.750 --> 04:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
happened to the majority position it's
 
04:02:47.429 --> 04:02:47.439 align:start position:0%
in you'd have to read it it's in the
 
04:02:47.439 --> 04:02:48.309 align:start position:0%
in you'd have to read it it's in the
commission

04:02:48.309 --> 04:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:02:50.870 --> 04:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
report but there's no legis followup
 
04:02:53.189 --> 04:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
there's no legislation that is being
 
04:02:56.349 --> 04:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
brought forward the the the minority
 
04:02:58.149 --> 04:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
position is being brought forward in
 
04:03:01.910 --> 04:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
this bill no this bill has nothing to do
 
04:03:05.110 --> 04:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
with the summer commission okay yes
 
04:03:08.149 --> 04:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
various pieces from the from that
 
04:03:10.950 --> 04:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
commission were brought forward uh I did
 
04:03:14.990 --> 04:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of them and not some were
 
04:03:16.590 --> 04:03:16.600 align:start position:0%
approved and some weren't but they were
 
04:03:18.229 --> 04:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
definitely bits in
 
04:03:21.229 --> 04:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
pieces yes representative groa excuse me
 
04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
representative land uh thank you madam
 
04:03:25.469 --> 04:03:25.479 align:start position:0%
chair um you stated that something
 
04:03:27.389 --> 04:03:27.399 align:start position:0%
passed the house with a veto proof
 
04:03:29.510 --> 04:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
majority and I'd just like clarification
 
04:03:31.189 --> 04:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
on what that was was it the same
 
04:03:32.830 --> 04:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
language as in this bill or was it
 
04:03:34.790 --> 04:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
something else so it was House Bill 436
 
04:03:37.229 --> 04:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
that was passed by a veto proof majority
 
04:03:40.189 --> 04:03:40.199 align:start position:0%
of the house when it was put into the
 
04:03:44.269 --> 04:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
budget um it is
 
04:03:46.670 --> 04:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
almost the same I mean you I we'd have
 
04:03:49.030 --> 04:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
I'd have to sit there like
 
04:03:52.309 --> 04:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't if you really want to
 
04:03:53.870 --> 04:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
go through sections I I don't know that
 
04:03:57.670 --> 04:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
we need to but um yes it's it's 90% the
 
04:04:00.389 --> 04:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
same okay is a followup follow up follow
 
04:04:01.750 --> 04:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand because I
 
04:04:03.389 --> 04:04:03.399 align:start position:0%
had pulled up the legislative history
 
04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
and when it when it passed as its own
 
04:04:07.990 --> 04:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
individual bill that was it had actually
 
04:04:10.269 --> 04:04:10.279 align:start position:0%
replaced with $50 million to pay down
 
04:04:12.630 --> 04:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
the debt and that's what the Senate um
 
04:04:15.429 --> 04:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
ended up um inter I'm studying but um
 
04:04:17.189 --> 04:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
looking back previously I see that it
 
04:04:20.030 --> 04:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
was a Voice vote um when it with the
 
04:04:22.469 --> 04:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
committee report but I'm not seeing it
 
04:04:24.149 --> 04:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
oh sorry thought to pass with Amendment
 
04:04:25.550 --> 04:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
that's what happens when I start to try
 
04:04:27.149 --> 04:04:27.159 align:start position:0%
to play this on the Fly that's what I
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
was trying to tease out it was amended
 
04:04:31.429 --> 04:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry if I yes it was 436 as
 
04:04:34.070 --> 04:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
amended there was there was some tweaks
 
04:04:37.710 --> 04:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
to it but yes it did pass um with a veto
 
04:04:40.269 --> 04:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
proof margin but again that's that's two
 
04:04:43.229 --> 04:04:43.239 align:start position:0%
years ago this is today but that is
 
04:04:45.590 --> 04:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's the historical derivative of 727
 
04:04:48.830 --> 04:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
now is it came from House Bill
 
04:04:51.149 --> 04:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
436 there's no sense in Reinventing the
 
04:04:54.189 --> 04:04:54.199 align:start position:0%
wheel here we that was something that
 
04:04:56.990 --> 04:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
worked um the
 
04:04:59.389 --> 04:04:59.399 align:start position:0%
stakeholders got together and agreed to
 
04:05:02.990 --> 04:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
certain concessions to make this work
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
right because obviously we have to
 
04:05:06.630 --> 04:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
there's a goal here and it has to fit
 
04:05:10.149 --> 04:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
within a within a budget frame as well
 
04:05:11.910 --> 04:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
you have to be
 
04:05:14.229 --> 04:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
realistic okay thank you
 
04:05:18.030 --> 04:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
a followup thank you madam chair and um
 
04:05:19.590 --> 04:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
you you're stating that concessions have
 
04:05:23.070 --> 04:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
been made does this is this a final move
 
04:05:25.429 --> 04:05:25.439 align:start position:0%
or assuming that this passes will there
 
04:05:27.830 --> 04:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
be attempts to come back and get closer
 
04:05:31.550 --> 04:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
to uh what tier B um wants to see so one
 
04:05:34.189 --> 04:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
of the things that has come forward is
 
04:05:37.550 --> 04:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
and I'll use uh the speaker's own
 
04:05:40.349 --> 04:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
words Final Fix we've we've heard the
 
04:05:43.189 --> 04:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
term over Final Fix Final Fix final fix
 
04:05:46.429 --> 04:05:46.439 align:start position:0%
this I I will tell you represents a
 
04:05:46.439 --> 04:05:48.870 align:start position:0%
this I I will tell you represents a
final

04:05:48.870 --> 04:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:52.189 --> 04:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
fix thank you good to know repres Lon
 
04:05:53.670 --> 04:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you and that's the final fix
 
04:05:56.309 --> 04:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
for tier b um there's still a whole
 
04:05:57.790 --> 04:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
another class of employees that don't
 
04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
have the same benefits with so correct
 
04:06:03.550 --> 04:06:03.560 align:start position:0%
and there's a difference here so in the
 
04:06:05.389 --> 04:06:05.399 align:start position:0%
as we're using the tier a b and c
 
04:06:09.389 --> 04:06:09.399 align:start position:0%
monitors now tier C folks the conditions
 
04:06:12.510 --> 04:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
to which they were hired is the
 
04:06:14.990 --> 04:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
conditions to which they operate under
 
04:06:17.750 --> 04:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
whereas in the tier a folks same thing
 
04:06:19.429 --> 04:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
the conditions to which they work under
 
04:06:20.750 --> 04:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
are the conditions to which they were
 
04:06:23.910 --> 04:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
hired under only tier B has that been
 
04:06:27.070 --> 04:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
different so this does not involve any
 
04:06:29.070 --> 04:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
and honestly any changes to a tier C
 
04:06:30.790 --> 04:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
folks is the institution of a new
 
04:06:33.070 --> 04:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
benefit and that fight is for certainly
 
04:06:35.149 --> 04:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
another day if if we can you know if we
 
04:06:38.950 --> 04:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
as we discuss and argue the the package
 
04:06:41.269 --> 04:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
the the pension system as it exists for
 
04:06:44.229 --> 04:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
folks hired after July 1 of 2011
 
04:06:46.750 --> 04:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
that this does not touch them in any way
 
04:06:48.309 --> 04:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
that that's a fight for a whole another
 
04:06:51.710 --> 04:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:54.670 --> 04:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
people thank you represent
 
04:06:57.670 --> 04:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
broa so there I remember the fiscal note
 
04:07:00.590 --> 04:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 436 but I don't see one
 
04:07:02.670 --> 04:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
here so I'm hoping that the New
 
04:07:04.710 --> 04:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system will speak
 
04:07:08.710 --> 04:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
to that okay yep the
 
04:07:11.950 --> 04:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
um the fiscal aspects of
 
04:07:15.110 --> 04:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
this uh are are twofold
 
04:07:21.189 --> 04:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
one um is the 727 is amended version
 
04:07:23.269 --> 04:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
which the retirement system does not
 
04:07:25.469 --> 04:07:25.479 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal note on because it was
 
04:07:28.109 --> 04:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
created 72 hours
 
04:07:30.149 --> 04:07:30.159 align:start position:0%
ago they they may have one on the
 
04:07:31.750 --> 04:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
initial bill that's fine the other
 
04:07:33.710 --> 04:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
element of this is that for all of you
 
04:07:35.309 --> 04:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
that have paid attention to the
 
04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
governor's inaugu address the governor
 
04:07:39.109 --> 04:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
has made this clear that this is a top
 
04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
priority for her what her language is
 
04:07:42.990 --> 04:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
what this looks like from the governor's
 
04:07:47.189 --> 04:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
office no idea we'll all find out in the
 
04:07:48.910 --> 04:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
end of next week when the budget's
 
04:07:53.229 --> 04:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
released but um so there's
 
04:07:55.590 --> 04:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
certainly however it is that the budget
 
04:07:58.349 --> 04:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
writers create the budget there's
 
04:08:01.950 --> 04:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
there's all of that so um you know and
 
04:08:03.790 --> 04:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
ultimately I think that the prudent
 
04:08:05.870 --> 04:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
method to move forward with this is
 
04:08:07.590 --> 04:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
certainly through the the budget process
 
04:08:10.309 --> 04:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
if this is if this is how that's being
 
04:08:12.269 --> 04:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
introduced to the legislature is through
 
04:08:14.590 --> 04:08:14.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 then that is really the
 
04:08:16.510 --> 04:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
mechanism that is most
 
04:08:20.750 --> 04:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate to to address this
 
04:08:23.550 --> 04:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
but this is a policy committee there is
 
04:08:25.750 --> 04:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
policy here
 
04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
and that is what's being conveyed here
 
04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
the money part of this is is way outside
 
04:08:32.389 --> 04:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
our lane on this
 
04:08:36.109 --> 04:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
one okay other
 
04:08:38.670 --> 04:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
04:08:40.389 --> 04:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative foot for
 
04:08:44.550 --> 04:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
your efforts yeah he was brilliant yeah
 
04:08:47.269 --> 04:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
didn't say anything wrong thank you m I
 
04:08:50.189 --> 04:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
apologize for the confusion with the
 
04:08:50.199 --> 04:08:52.790 align:start position:0%
apologize for the confusion with the
stair

04:08:52.790 --> 04:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
stair
 
04:09:01.790 --> 04:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:05.590 --> 04:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
Kavanaugh we will be if you have a
 
04:09:10.790 --> 04:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:13.550 --> 04:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
it Madam chair members of the committee
 
04:09:15.550 --> 04:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
if you please again for the record my
 
04:09:19.189 --> 04:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
name is Mark Kavanaugh and I am Deputy
 
04:09:21.990 --> 04:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
counsel and compliance office for the
 
04:09:24.109 --> 04:09:24.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement
 
04:09:27.429 --> 04:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
system uh we do not have a fiscal note
 
04:09:29.710 --> 04:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
because we just received the actuary's
 
04:09:33.670 --> 04:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
report last night I can speak to some
 
04:09:36.910 --> 04:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
general numbers on that we will have
 
04:09:39.670 --> 04:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
something well we we were going to have
 
04:09:43.950 --> 04:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
something by the end of the week to um
 
04:09:46.830 --> 04:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
LBA but now if there's an amended
 
04:09:49.349 --> 04:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
version our actuaries would need to see
 
04:09:53.149 --> 04:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
if that changes any of their um uh
 
04:09:55.670 --> 04:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
numbers it sounds like it's mostly
 
04:09:57.590 --> 04:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
housekeeping and language type of
 
04:10:00.469 --> 04:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
changes but we need to run it by
 
04:10:00.479 --> 04:10:02.109 align:start position:0%
changes but we need to run it by
them

04:10:02.109 --> 04:10:02.119 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:10:04.590 --> 04:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
so before we get into the financial I
 
04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
just want to mention very briefly the
 
04:10:06.239 --> 04:10:07.510 align:start position:0%
just want to mention very briefly the
legal

04:10:07.510 --> 04:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
legal
 
04:10:11.790 --> 04:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
considerations um there were um
 
04:10:11.800 --> 04:10:14.229 align:start position:0%
considerations um there were um
ambiguities

04:10:14.229 --> 04:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
ambiguities
 
04:10:16.590 --> 04:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
clarifications that would be needed
 
04:10:18.750 --> 04:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
things we were uncertain about because
 
04:10:22.389 --> 04:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
of the language used uh uh for instance
 
04:10:25.389 --> 04:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
why use a September 1st cut off date
 
04:10:28.189 --> 04:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
when existing law was based on January
 
04:10:31.670 --> 04:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
1st um but there there's probably a good
 
04:10:33.750 --> 04:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
reason for that but we we don't
 
04:10:37.469 --> 04:10:37.479 align:start position:0%
understand the exact um purpose behind
 
04:10:39.469 --> 04:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
uh the sponsors but these are things
 
04:10:40.990 --> 04:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
that can be
 
04:10:43.349 --> 04:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
resolved uh and the language could be
 
04:10:46.510 --> 04:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
ironed out and perhaps that's better
 
04:10:46.520 --> 04:10:47.630 align:start position:0%
ironed out and perhaps that's better
suited

04:10:47.630 --> 04:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
suited
 
04:10:50.590 --> 04:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
for a subcommittee level after the
 
04:10:52.870 --> 04:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
financial considerations have been uh
 
04:10:54.750 --> 04:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the committee and there's a
 
04:10:57.070 --> 04:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
desire to move forward so I don't want
 
04:10:59.790 --> 04:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
to take up time with a lot of technical
 
04:11:02.429 --> 04:11:02.439 align:start position:0%
jargon and these are complicated bills
 
04:11:05.149 --> 04:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
trying to change multiple Provisions
 
04:11:08.149 --> 04:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
across the whole spectrum of our statute
 
04:11:11.469 --> 04:11:11.479 align:start position:0%
um even the experts who've been doing
 
04:11:13.550 --> 04:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
this for a long time would struggle to
 
04:11:15.870 --> 04:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
get it right on the first try and and
 
04:11:17.830 --> 04:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
again that's something we can work
 
04:11:19.830 --> 04:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
through and figure out what language
 
04:11:22.710 --> 04:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
accomplishes what the sponsors want to
 
04:11:24.870 --> 04:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
accomplish if it's the committee desire
 
04:11:28.030 --> 04:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
to move forward um with respect to the
 
04:11:30.389 --> 04:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
financial considerations I would cave on
 
04:11:35.070 --> 04:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
anything I'm about to say uh that these
 
04:11:37.630 --> 04:11:37.640 align:start position:0%
numbers may change based on whatever
 
04:11:42.990 --> 04:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
amendments uh but in general um the bill
 
04:11:45.670 --> 04:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
at as currently written has a positive
 
04:11:49.790 --> 04:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
effect on the finances of the system it
 
04:11:54.269 --> 04:11:54.279 align:start position:0%
would result in a very nominal decrease
 
04:11:57.670 --> 04:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
in the police and fire rates of less
 
04:11:57.680 --> 04:11:59.309 align:start position:0%
in the police and fire rates of less
than

04:11:59.309 --> 04:11:59.319 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:12:02.910 --> 04:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
0.5% and it would result in a a
 
04:12:05.269 --> 04:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
reduction of the underfunding of around
 
04:12:08.309 --> 04:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
10 or 15 million
 
04:12:12.109 --> 04:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
doll uh but this is all predicated on
 
04:12:15.870 --> 04:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
the state paying $ 27.5 million for the
 
04:12:19.389 --> 04:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
next 10 years beginning July 1st in the
 
04:12:21.950 --> 04:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
absence of those
 
04:12:24.630 --> 04:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
payments employer rates for police and
 
04:12:28.750 --> 04:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
fire would go up about three to 4% and
 
04:12:32.269 --> 04:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
the unfunded acred liability would go up
 
04:12:35.990 --> 04:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
by 110 million so as written it has a
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
positive effect um assuming it's funded
 
04:12:40.319 --> 04:12:41.469 align:start position:0%
positive effect um assuming it's funded
as

04:12:41.469 --> 04:12:41.479 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:12:44.030 --> 04:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
intended uh that's all I have to say
 
04:12:47.910 --> 04:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
today uh we'll Endeavor to get uh once
 
04:12:50.510 --> 04:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
we see it an amendment we'll Endeavor to
 
04:12:52.910 --> 04:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
get a finalized fiscal not workk sheet
 
04:12:54.710 --> 04:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
to the committee so they can see the
 
04:12:57.550 --> 04:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
actual numbers I don't suspect they
 
04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
would change a lot given what uh
 
04:13:02.910 --> 04:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson has described as
 
04:13:06.870 --> 04:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
language changes and the like um with
 
04:13:09.550 --> 04:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
that I'd open that up to any
 
04:13:09.560 --> 04:13:11.349 align:start position:0%
that I'd open that up to any
questions

04:13:11.349 --> 04:13:11.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:13:14.910 --> 04:13:14.920 align:start position:0%

04:13:24.389 --> 04:13:24.399 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Troopers Association I'd like
 
04:15:27.469 --> 04:15:27.479 align:start position:0%
to start by uh thanking this committee
 
04:15:29.389 --> 04:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
for their dedicated work in the past on
 
04:15:31.670 --> 04:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
retirement uh especially as it pertains
 
04:15:33.950 --> 04:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
to group two two years ago this
 
04:15:35.590 --> 04:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
committee um as well as the house
 
04:15:38.710 --> 04:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly passed House Bill 436 uh
 
04:15:40.349 --> 04:15:40.359 align:start position:0%
which was a compromise that restored
 
04:15:41.830 --> 04:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
many benefits that were taken away from
 
04:15:44.149 --> 04:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
First Responders unfortunately that bill
 
04:15:46.109 --> 04:15:46.119 align:start position:0%
did not get through the Senate um I
 
04:15:47.550 --> 04:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
would like to thank representative foot
 
04:15:50.309 --> 04:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
for bringing this bill here today um
 
04:15:52.149 --> 04:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
which looked very similar to
 
04:15:54.750 --> 04:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
436 and I am of the understanding that
 
04:15:56.670 --> 04:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
the governor intends to address group
 
04:15:59.389 --> 04:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
two retirement in her budget and in an
 
04:16:02.469 --> 04:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
attempt to Not Duplicate efforts um we
 
04:16:04.030 --> 04:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
are asking for this bill to be retained
 
04:16:05.030 --> 04:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
in this
 
04:16:07.229 --> 04:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
committee thank
 
04:16:09.790 --> 04:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
you uh Madam chairman thank you my name
 
04:16:12.389 --> 04:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
is James deur and I work with the New
 
04:16:14.429 --> 04:16:14.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Troop Association and the New
 
04:16:15.830 --> 04:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Police
 
04:16:18.269 --> 04:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
Association um I wanted to just take a
 
04:16:19.950 --> 04:16:19.960 align:start position:0%
moment because for some of the new
 
04:16:22.030 --> 04:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
members there may still be a little bit
 
04:16:25.189 --> 04:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
of confusion over what happened in the
 
04:16:29.429 --> 04:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
past and why everybody is here today so
 
04:16:32.269 --> 04:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
um as you have heard from representative
 
04:16:36.229 --> 04:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
Pearson and others uh two years ago this
 
04:16:40.070 --> 04:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
committee passed House Bill 436 which
 
04:16:42.189 --> 04:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
was similar to this bill very
 
04:16:45.389 --> 04:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Bill uh reinstating some
 
04:16:48.429 --> 04:16:48.439 align:start position:0%
of the benefits that the middle
 
04:16:50.670 --> 04:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
tier of group
 
04:16:54.189 --> 04:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
two um lost during the negotiations that
 
04:16:57.469 --> 04:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
took place 12 years ago so as you know
 
04:17:00.189 --> 04:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
there are three different tiers to group
 
04:17:04.590 --> 04:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
two there's tier a which are the many of
 
04:17:07.710 --> 04:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
them are retired maybe most of them um
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
there's tier C which were the new hires
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
and then there was a middle tier and the
 
04:17:16.349 --> 04:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
real issue that happened 12 years ago
 
04:17:19.590 --> 04:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
was that the middle tier had been hired
 
04:17:21.870 --> 04:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
with an understanding of certain
 
04:17:25.469 --> 04:17:25.479 align:start position:0%
benefits and during that process they
 
04:17:27.910 --> 04:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
lost some of the benefits they thought
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
they had been uh given when they were
 
04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
hired so this has been sort of the issue
 
04:17:37.269 --> 04:17:37.279 align:start position:0%
that has festered now for 12 years and I
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
can tell you that we really appreciate
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
the work that representative Pearson has
 
04:17:45.070 --> 04:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
done for half a dozen years now on this
 
04:17:49.269 --> 04:17:49.279 align:start position:0%
topic um and we as Frank said we
 
04:17:51.670 --> 04:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate the work that this committee
 
04:17:56.469 --> 04:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
did two years ago when the big Bill 436
 
04:17:59.229 --> 04:17:59.239 align:start position:0%
passed um and unfortunately the Senate
 
04:18:02.429 --> 04:18:02.439 align:start position:0%
did not pass that as representative
 
04:18:05.990 --> 04:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
groda indicated when that bill came back
 
04:18:07.950 --> 04:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
it was turned into a
 
04:18:12.590 --> 04:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
commission that worked on Pieces of What
 
04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
was was in 436 a year ago summer and
 
04:18:19.229 --> 04:18:19.239 align:start position:0%
then this past session you did pass one
 
04:18:22.030 --> 04:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
item which was changing the multiplier
 
04:18:25.790 --> 04:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
provision for the middle tier so um as
 
04:18:29.469 --> 04:18:29.479 align:start position:0%
you've heard from others uh Governor aot
 
04:18:31.950 --> 04:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
has indicated that this is a priority
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
issue that we expect we will see in
 
04:18:38.070 --> 04:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
either the budget or in House Bill too
 
04:18:40.309 --> 04:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
um we do appreciate the work that her
 
04:18:43.229 --> 04:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
staff has has done they have reached out
 
04:18:46.510 --> 04:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
to the stakeholder group uh run language
 
04:18:48.030 --> 04:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
bias we have not
 
04:18:50.510 --> 04:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
seen the final version that will come
 
04:18:54.109 --> 04:18:54.119 align:start position:0%
out next week but as Mr mallister said
 
04:18:57.469 --> 04:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
and as Mr Campo said we expect something
 
04:19:00.830 --> 04:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
will be in House Bill 2 um we think that
 
04:19:02.710 --> 04:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
probably is the vehicle that makes the
 
04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
most sense to focus on so if this
 
04:19:07.189 --> 04:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
committee is willing we would also
 
04:19:09.590 --> 04:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
support retaining this bill and using
 
04:19:12.550 --> 04:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 as the vehicle for dealing
 
04:19:14.510 --> 04:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
with with
 
04:19:17.109 --> 04:19:17.119 align:start position:0%

more seasoned folks in the in the

legislature when you have a piece of
 
04:22:59.109 --> 04:22:59.119 align:start position:0%
legislation that is going to be
 
04:23:02.229 --> 04:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
addressed in h Bill one or two this is a
 
04:23:06.630 --> 04:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
procedural move to allow the process
 
04:23:10.469 --> 04:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
that better fits the solution to take
 
04:23:14.630 --> 04:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
charge and in every case it is to let it
 
04:23:17.830 --> 04:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
go through House Bill one or two so that
 
04:23:20.269 --> 04:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
is The Prudent way to go and it would
 
04:23:22.790 --> 04:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
certainly apply to the situation that's
 
04:23:24.950 --> 04:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
in front of us right now thank you

members of the committee from back in
 
04:23:33.870 --> 04:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
those days I'm glad to see that we are
 
04:23:37.469 --> 04:23:37.479 align:start position:0%
moving in a more hopeful way to get
 
04:23:42.070 --> 04:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
something that will be um more likely to
 
04:23:42.080 --> 04:23:43.229 align:start position:0%
something that will be um more likely to
prevail

04:23:43.229 --> 04:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
prevail
 
04:23:46.910 --> 04:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
through through both bodies uh so I'm
 
04:23:49.750 --> 04:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
happy to Second it all right does anyone
 
04:23:54.510 --> 04:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:58.030 --> 04:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
concerns okay I like to mention that the
 
04:24:00.510 --> 04:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
purpose of retain is so that we don't
 
04:24:03.189 --> 04:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
establish a policy of killing the bill
 
04:24:06.030 --> 04:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
but we don't have to work on it until
 
04:24:09.030 --> 04:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
after the budget has completed going
 
04:24:10.550 --> 04:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
through the house and the Senate and the
 
04:24:12.670 --> 04:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
committee of conference and at that
 
04:24:15.389 --> 04:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
point we can look at this bill and say
 
04:24:17.790 --> 04:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
gee they left this part this policy
 
04:24:20.510 --> 04:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
issue out we can and deal with it at
 
04:24:22.510 --> 04:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
that or we can just say thank God they
 
04:24:24.030 --> 04:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
took care of everything and we can just
 
04:24:26.670 --> 04:24:26.680 align:start position:0%
quietly kill this bill that those will
 
04:24:30.830 --> 04:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
be our choices after the budget has been
 
04:24:33.910 --> 04:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
passed and as representative Pearson
 
04:24:37.990 --> 04:24:38.000 align:start position:0%

amendment to the bill cleans up the
 
04:28:10.830 --> 04:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
number of
 
04:28:13.790 --> 04:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
members and
 
04:28:15.550 --> 04:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
requires two
 
04:28:18.590 --> 04:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
reports one a preliminary report no and
 
04:28:22.189 --> 04:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
25 and a longer one in 06
 
04:28:22.199 --> 04:28:24.830 align:start position:0%
25 and a longer one in 06
26

04:28:24.830 --> 04:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
26
 
04:28:28.229 --> 04:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
and I've been assured by our legal
 
04:28:30.910 --> 04:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
experts that since this is not a statute
 
04:28:33.750 --> 04:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's chapter law that it doesn't need an
 
04:28:36.710 --> 04:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
explicit repeal that the fact that the
 
04:28:40.030 --> 04:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
final report is due in 26 means this
 
04:28:46.189 --> 04:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:49.590 --> 04:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
correct you have to repeal a statute the
 
04:28:54.269 --> 04:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
chapter law if if it's specifically to
 
04:28:58.830 --> 04:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
do something through 26 it expires or so
 
04:29:02.349 --> 04:29:02.359 align:start position:0%
I have been told
 
04:29:06.469 --> 04:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:09.950 --> 04:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
it it's all the people that this struck
 
04:29:13.550 --> 04:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
me as a very good idea to take advantage
 
04:29:15.469 --> 04:29:15.479 align:start position:0%
of some of the ex knowledge and
 
04:29:18.469 --> 04:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
experience of house members on data
 
04:29:20.149 --> 04:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
because we do have a lot of people who
 
04:29:23.469 --> 04:29:23.479 align:start position:0%
know about it and if they can identify
 
04:29:26.269 --> 04:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
loow hanging fruit and information that
 
04:29:29.670 --> 04:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
can be shared by departments without a
 
04:29:32.109 --> 04:29:32.119 align:start position:0%
great deal of extra work I think that
 
04:29:32.119 --> 04:29:33.950 align:start position:0%
great deal of extra work I think that
will

04:29:33.950 --> 04:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:29:37.229 --> 04:29:37.239 align:start position:0%
improve both efficiency and transparency
 
04:29:39.830 --> 04:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm in favor of both of those
 
04:29:42.590 --> 04:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative LAN
 
04:29:44.870 --> 04:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair I agree this I
 
04:29:46.870 --> 04:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
believe this is a needed committee
 
04:29:48.790 --> 04:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
commission so that we can have a better
 
04:29:50.990 --> 04:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
handle on data and use the data that we
 
04:29:53.149 --> 04:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
have to make better policy choices and I
 
04:29:54.830 --> 04:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
think we have a quite the roster of
 
04:29:56.990 --> 04:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
people that can serve on this committee
 
04:29:59.590 --> 04:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm excited to see this
 
04:30:03.830 --> 04:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
happen represent brto thank you I wish I
 
04:30:05.990 --> 04:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
could support this amendment but I
 
04:30:06.000 --> 04:30:07.590 align:start position:0%
could support this amendment but I
cannot

04:30:07.590 --> 04:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
04:30:10.550 --> 04:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
because I had specifically mentioned
 
04:30:13.670 --> 04:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
that if this is truly a bipartisan
 
04:30:15.510 --> 04:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
committee M there needs to be
 
04:30:17.229 --> 04:30:17.239 align:start position:0%
representatives from both the majority
 
04:30:19.950 --> 04:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
and the minority in the house and and I
 
04:30:22.670 --> 04:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
don't see that and the other there's no
 
04:30:26.870 --> 04:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
mention of pii which is the Privacy
 
04:30:28.550 --> 04:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
Information doesn't say anything about
 
04:30:30.510 --> 04:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
that either and I do believe I asked
 
04:30:33.149 --> 04:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
that question of Representative corkran
 
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
and he did tell me that he thought that
 
04:30:36.830 --> 04:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
was an important
 
04:30:40.469 --> 04:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
part ah those are both
 
04:30:43.070 --> 04:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
both valid
 
04:30:46.710 --> 04:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
concerns and in fact I will revi I think
 
04:30:49.790 --> 04:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
I will take that to heart and revise it
 
04:30:57.429 --> 04:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:59.790 --> 04:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
that all right in that case I will
 
04:31:03.229 --> 04:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
recess the executive session until I can
 
04:31:06.349 --> 04:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
get a better Amendment
 
04:31:08.309 --> 04:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
and yes
 
04:31:11.189 --> 04:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
sir I I have to say I very much
 
04:31:13.229 --> 04:31:13.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate some some kind of revision
 
04:31:16.389 --> 04:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
because uh as I sat and listened to
 
04:31:18.510 --> 04:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
representative Corker and I thought
 
04:31:21.510 --> 04:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
maybe when in two or 3,000 years when we
 
04:31:23.670 --> 04:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
have uh when we
 
04:31:27.030 --> 04:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
have standardized every other thing in
 
04:31:30.750 --> 04:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
the universe other than that that this
 
04:31:34.189 --> 04:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
kind of a you know incredibly
 
04:31:38.870 --> 04:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
complex uh you know microscopic invasion
 
04:31:42.870 --> 04:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
of every aspect of this whole subject
 
04:31:45.910 --> 04:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh but this
 
04:31:48.830 --> 04:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
version I couldn't support that okay
 
04:31:53.389 --> 04:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
thank you we we will withdraw this am
 
04:31:56.309 --> 04:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
we'll get a better Amendment and uh come
 
04:31:59.109 --> 04:31:59.119 align:start position:0%
back later I I think that the point is
 
04:32:01.630 --> 04:32:01.640 align:start position:0%
important but the words don't appear to
 
04:32:01.640 --> 04:32:02.429 align:start position:0%
important but the words don't appear to
be

04:32:02.429 --> 04:32:02.439 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:32:04.550 --> 04:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
correct all
 
04:32:07.870 --> 04:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
right all right end of executive session
 
04:32:11.389 --> 04:32:11.399 align:start position:0%

04:32:16.309 --> 04:32:16.319 align:start position:0%

perfectly

04:33:40.709 --> 04:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
