00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to go ahead and and start
 
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
this Committee of conference here uh
 
00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
this bill is relative to HB
 
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
1298 the definition of part-time
 
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
teachers and we do have a side by side
 
00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
that's been provided to us one side the
 
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 align:start position:0%
left side showing the house version and
 
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
the right side the Senate
 
00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
version um there is a significant
 
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
difference between between the two
 
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
versions so right now I'm just going to
 
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
open this up to discussion as I have the
 
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
other Committee of conferences and is
 
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.709 align:start position:0%
other Committee of conferences and is
there

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to lead out
 
00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 align:start position:0%
here let's have the Senate mind yeah so
 
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
again I I can speak for um the people
 
00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
position um that's qualified yeah uh so
 
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
again the intent here was on the Senate
 
00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
side was to allow local school boards
 
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 align:start position:0%
fle uh an increased amount of
 
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
flexibility uh not involving the State
 
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Education with the
 
00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 align:start position:0%
exception of a background check um and
 
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 align:start position:0%
to allow local school boards and
 
00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 align:start position:0%
trusting that local school boards would
 
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
be able to find those POs people within
 
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
their Community to fill what a part-time
 
00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 align:start position:0%
need that they have um and again it may
 
00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 align:start position:0%
be a situation where um I'm going to use
 
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
especially the specials the art you know
 
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
those kind of things music um a school
 
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
may not have a reason to have a
 
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
full-time art teacher but they have a
 
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
reason to have a full-time art teacher
 
00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
that could teach in five different
 
00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 align:start position:0%
classes or share it with another school
 
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
district and so the ability to have the
 
00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 align:start position:0%
local board decide that the the local
 
00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
artist that has an art shop downtown on
 
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
Main Street is goes through an
 
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
application process goes through a uh a
 
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
review and they can make the
 
00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
determination that we think this art
 
00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 align:start position:0%
teacher whe this art uh um professional
 
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
um could teach art in our school with no
 
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
problem um and they make that
 
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
determination not involving the State
 
00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
Board of Education and hire that teacher
 
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
for a half a day um to be able to come
 
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
in and teach once one class in a middle
 
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
school one class in the high school um
 
00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
if that's what's necessary um but we
 
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
trust in that the school boards should
 
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
be able to make the determination and
 
00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
evaluate their people like they do all
 
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
other positions um without the Board of
 
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.470 align:start position:0%
other positions um without the Board of
Education

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
involved okay it sounds as if you're
 
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
you're speaking to
 
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
eliminating um BC on on the house side
 
00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 align:start position:0%
on rment number one uh B and
 
00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
C um is that correct uh right again the
 
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
the bill before us is amended by the
 
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
Senate so so the Senate position is
 
00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
talking position I get I'm guessing um
 
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
and so the question is whether they go
 
00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
back to the house position yeah so yeah
 
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
so again I'm speaking strictly to the
 
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
Senate position and again I think you
 
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
know again we have we have requirements
 
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
of a bachelor's degree of content area
 
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
um and I I I'd argue that not
 
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily every content area would
 
00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
have tests not everybody has a
 
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree but they'd be
 
00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 align:start position:0%
completely qualified to be able to teach
 
00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
and so um if if the school board again
 
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
the local hiring Authority determines
 
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
that they're going to have an evaluation
 
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
process we're not just saying anybody
 
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
can walk in and apply what we're saying
 
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
is well andbody can walk in and apply
 
00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 align:start position:0%
but it's not without an evaluation the
 
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
school districts have the right to
 
00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
create whatever policies they want
 
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
around so we'll talk to uh you know one
 
00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
of the things I was just talking to Mr
 
00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
app about was um you know the content
 
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
exam could a school board and its local
 
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
policy for hiring a part-time teachers
 
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
establish a Content exam as part of that
 
00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 align:start position:0%
sure that's up to them to determine what
 
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
their qualifications they want with the
 
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
their part-time teachers are um I think
 
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
this allows for the greatest flexibility
 
00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 align:start position:0%
given the teacher shortage um to allow
 
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
especially business professionals or
 
00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
Professionals in their industry whether
 
00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
I'll use an automotive class right that
 
00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
maybe still in a high school not at a
 
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
CTE um you can bring a local mechanic in
 
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
who may have the skills to teach and yet
 
00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a bachelor's degree right
 
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
if a school wanted to offer a one class
 
00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 align:start position:0%
in wood shop they can bring a carpenter
 
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
in and and have that Carpenter teach it
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
may not have a bachelor's degree and I'm
 
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
not sure there's a Content exam for that
 
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
person but why we require that Carpenter
 
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
or that electrician or that that or that
 
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
auto mechanic to go and get a
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
certification from the Board of
 
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
Education um so again I think that
 
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
leaving it at the local Schoolboard
 
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
level for part-time positions make sense
 
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
let those districts establish their own
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
criteria for what they believe let them
 
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
use their own judgment for what they
 
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
believe um because I'm sure and I know
 
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
from being on the school board that
 
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
there are people that come with a
 
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
certification from the Department of
 
00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
Education that we don't keep on on keep
 
00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
educating so it's not a guarantee just
 
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
because someone has certification from
 
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
doe means they're going to be a great
 
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
teacher um uh so this just recognizes
 
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
that flexibility gives the flexibility
 
00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 align:start position:0%
especially considering the shortage that
 
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
we're undergoing in education right now
 
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.790 align:start position:0%
we're undergoing in education right now
further

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
discussion Mr chair yes I was just
 
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
reading yesterday what they're trying to
 
00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
do with the veterans coming home and
 
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
having finished their service that many
 
00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
of them are extremely qualified for all
 
00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
kinds of skills to be taught in in the
 
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
school and I think that's
 
00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
a good source of uh a part-time
 
00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
teachers so there are groups of people
 
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
available that could do the teaching
 
00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
that don't have a certificate of you
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
know from a teacher
 
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
College uh where in this bill is it
 
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
talking about certification in a teacher
 
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh Senator so sure so look at section c
 
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
in your bill right says if the New
 
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education
 
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
determines this requirement is not
 
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
met right so again we're involving the
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
state in some sort of certifying aspect
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
um to qualify an individual and and
 
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
again I think local school boards are
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
more than capable our elected officials
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
at the local school board are more than
 
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
capable of determining what employees
 
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
will meet the need of that District
 
00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 align:start position:0%
without this oversight of the Department
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
of Education I I think we need to get
 
00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
some clarification here um we initially
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
when this bill came to us it talked
 
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
about certification this was changed as
 
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
you see right at the top of the house
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
version where it says part-time teachers
 
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
semicolon adjunct
 
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
authorization so they are now going to
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
be receiving adjunct authorization is
 
00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
certification that's the question I have
 
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
and I was I was indicated maybe that can
 
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
be clarified by the the bureau or the
 
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
department sitting here but I need to
 
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
have a response to that particular
 
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
question uh if it's adjunct
 
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
authorization then I if we're concerned
 
00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
about certification and all the
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
consequences of certification where that
 
00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
leads to and working with other teachers
 
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 align:start position:0%
in the building and all that and Labor
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
Relations um I would think that um
 
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
adjunct authorization would not be be
 
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
the same but um I'm going to call
 
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
forward uh Mr applebe for some comment
 
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
have thank you Mr chair good morning
 
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
everyone uh Steve applebe Department of
 
00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:52.759 align:start position:0%
Education um so we use a number of terms
 
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
in the Bureau of credentialing the
 
00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:57.879 align:start position:0%
overriding umbrella term as I explain it
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
is the word credential
 
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
and within that under that umbrella we
 
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
have lure we have
 
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
authorization right lure is a teacher
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
license and a principal license and so
 
00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
forth they're fully licensed and that
 
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
word has meaning around the country and
 
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
the word license is typically a word
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
used when it's a government entity
 
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
giving out something as opposed to the
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
word certification which we've moved
 
00:08:24.909 --> 00:08:24.919 align:start position:0%
away from because
 
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
certification very often like Microsoft
 
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
I was a Microsoft certified systems
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
engineer for years certifications are
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
given out by non-governmental entities
 
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
right so we use the word license first
 
00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
of all so um when we're talking about
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
Educators we give out licenses right um
 
00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:44.519 align:start position:0%
we also give out authorizations so we
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
give out intern authorizations today
 
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
that's a person on an alternative
 
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
pathway an authorization is not a
 
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
license but they are both
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
credentials so they fall under the term
 
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
credential and we do that as well for uh
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
misconduct purposes investig ative
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
purposes code of conduct code of ethics
 
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
purposes we use that term credential but
 
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
then when you drill into it we use lure
 
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
and we use authorization and
 
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
authorization is not a
 
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:13.240 align:start position:0%
license so that's how we Define them as
 
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
being different and we don't use
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
certification if we can avoid
 
00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
it I hope that clarifies a little yes so
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
again so as you look at section three of
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
the bill right so we are talking about
 
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
um the last sentence of of section uh C
 
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
on page one right it says um the hand
 
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Education for the
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
determination as to whether an adequate
 
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
occupational experience is documented to
 
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:37.240 align:start position:0%
justify the issuance of an adjunct
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
authorization so here again we're
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
requiring the Department of Education to
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
issue an authorization for an individual
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
that school district you know and I just
 
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
don't think that's necessary to get to
 
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:50.200 align:start position:0%
for a part-time position to have the
 
00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Education involved and
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
qualifying someone that does local
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
itself question does
 
00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:02.839 align:start position:0%
the department have then no
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility to ensure oversight to
 
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519 align:start position:0%
meet the minimum Public School approval
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
standards to ensure that music is being
 
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
taught and physical education is being
 
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
taught or special education or any of
 
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
our areas that were under the criteria
 
00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education are taught
 
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
appropriately or is that now going to be
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
uh provided to the Local District to
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
I'm Sor you asking me or him well I'm
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
asking anybody can help me out with that
 
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I am
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
really with the old phone number uh I'm
 
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:44.200 align:start position:0%
I'm really concerned here that yeah I I
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
see we have some things listen under an
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
A B and C uh I'm seeing that all that's
 
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.829 align:start position:0%
A B and C uh I'm seeing that all that's
being

00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:50.839 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
subtracted and there there is no
 
00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
criteria which is being set forth for
 
00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.829 align:start position:0%
criteria which is being set forth for
this

00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
authorization which is a credentialing
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:11.949 --> 00:11:11.959 align:start position:0%
issue and that so does when we're
 
00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:13.069 align:start position:0%
issue and that so does when we're
talking

00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
authorization is that the department
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
have nothing to play with that or to do
 
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.670 align:start position:0%
have nothing to play with that or to do
with

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
that I if if I may I think um elsewhere
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
in the bill if memory serves we
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned the criminal history record
 
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
check clearance that we would give out
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
clearance is another type of credential
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
that we do have um the authority to
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
resend if there is a misconduct
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
situation that occurs so um an
 
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
individual would still be coming if if
 
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
the other language was struck around
 
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
authorization I would if the state board
 
00:11:52.509 --> 00:11:52.519 align:start position:0%
approved you know adopted rules I would
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
assume that that
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
clearance could be could be rescinded
 
00:11:59.949 --> 00:11:59.959 align:start position:0%
but that wouldn't speak to qu
 
00:12:01.949 --> 00:12:01.959 align:start position:0%
qualitative you touched on the other
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
point that I have a concern with in the
 
00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:06.519 align:start position:0%
Senate version it says they seek a
 
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
criminal history records check
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
background check they meaning the
 
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
individual not the department whereas in
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
ours in in the house version The Local
 
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
School District shall seek so you have a
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
local government agency seeking this
 
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
criminal background check and or our
 
00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
clearance uh from the Department of
 
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
Education um
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
who who who initiates that well current
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
state statute states that if if a a
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
school district hires you you have to
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
have a background check locally and and
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
the school board must have uh policies
 
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
in place regarding that check who
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
initiates that check and the individual
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
goes and gets that check designates the
 
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
local school district as the recipient
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
check okay we've now gone in a direction
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
where new applicants and teacher prep
 
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
applicants must also get a clearance and
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
M Mr chair if I can again so I use the
 
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
example I'll go back to my coaching
 
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
experience I had to get a background
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
Corey check um when I was coaching
 
00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
because it was a requirement for me to
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
coach um but again I went and submitted
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
the paperwork to the state police and
 
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
then I designated the to be delivered to
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
the local school board who then verified
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
I was not a danger to the students um
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
and were able to allow me to do that
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
this follows that same exact process
 
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
that's outlined in 198
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
4-c I'm sorry wrong wrong sorry it's
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
1983 um so again we're following that
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
same procedure we currently already use
 
00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
that's not new ground for local school
 
00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
boards to deal with non-credentialed
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
individuals who still need to have a
 
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
background check
 
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
discussion why is it uh for walking
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
through I'd like to know why the Senate
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
version uh went to 30 rather than 20
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
week why why did what 30 versus 20 hours
 
00:14:15.949 --> 00:14:15.959 align:start position:0%
again I think we use the federal
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
guideline for what's defined as a
 
00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:22.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
hours there do you think there's any
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
consequences I I'm just asking all the
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
questions are buzzing through my head
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
here but do you think there's any
 
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
consequences to allowing 30 hours per
 
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
week when you divide that by five that's
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
6 hours per day that becomes then a
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
full-time teacher well again what we
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
were accounting for is the fact that you
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
may have a teacher that doesn't
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily teach in a high school for
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
six hours a day but may teach in a high
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
school for a couple hours a day teach at
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
Middle School a couple hours a day go
 
00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
down to the elementary school and maybe
 
00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
teach a couple hour days none of which
 
00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
have room for a full-time employee in
 
00:14:51.639 --> 00:14:53.629 align:start position:0%
have room for a full-time employee in
their

00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:55.959 align:start position:0%
budget so we're allowed for the fact
 
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
that you'll have and never mind
 
00:14:59.069 --> 00:14:59.079 align:start position:0%
individual districts you may have an ESS
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
say you that hires a person and they
 
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
they teach in different districts so we
 
00:15:05.749 --> 00:15:05.759 align:start position:0%
didn't want that to be the cumulative
 
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
effect of they hire a part-time teacher
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
that teaches three different districts
 
00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:11.959 align:start position:0%
um but under the SAU language they would
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
be disqualified if they taught more than
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
20 hours even if they try to teach in
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
three different
 
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
districts and they don't necessarily
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
teach of five days a week either it
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
could be less than that all depends on
 
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
the all depends on the subject matter
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
and the curriculum so we use we use 30
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
strictly because of the Federal
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
is do you have any objections to
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
reducing that from 30 to
 
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
20 that's a new
 
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
question do I have an objection to what
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
re to reduce that from 30 to
 
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
20 well I mean 20
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
is what do you get for 20 it seems to me
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
if you're going to hire a teacher you
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
want to have them as much as possible if
 
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
it's part-time If part time is 30 hours
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
a week then you have more flexibility in
 
00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:05.959 align:start position:0%
using this teacher in different areas on
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
different if we talk about an SIU in
 
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.110 align:start position:0%
different if we talk about an SIU in
different

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
districts so Mr chair I i' I'd make the
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
comment if 30 hours a week gets you to a
 
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
yes and that's the only thing we change
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
I'd agree to 20 hours a
 
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
week but if we're going to talk about a
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
bunch of more changes and I'm not going
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
to agree to it right now I'll have
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
further conversation about what we're
 
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
talking about okay let's go down to the
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
next one so we had you yes you're
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
willing to change if we change nothing
 
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:35.839 align:start position:0%
else uh B on the house side stipulates
 
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
that the individual must have earned a
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree or hire with a major
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
in or related to the field of
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
authorization and must submit passing
 
00:16:45.309 --> 00:16:45.319 align:start position:0%
scores on the content knowledge exam or
 
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
exams required for authorization area if
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
exists if one exists
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
um is there any uh rationale why you're
 
00:16:59.470 --> 00:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
saying that I I've heard you saying you
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
you you could be a certified you know uh
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
data person in Microsoft or something
 
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:09.079 align:start position:0%
such as that and well qualified to with
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
the content and knowledge uh I I
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
understand that but in terms of
 
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
um other areas um why is is a bachelor's
 
00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:22.039 align:start position:0%
degree a hang-up or would it be a
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
sociate degree or or just that there's
 
00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
just just saying it's too much control
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
from on I and the local is not able to
 
00:17:32.909 --> 00:17:32.919 align:start position:0%
hire the person you want I'll take
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
yeah right so again the idea being is we
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
have the Senate's position was that we
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
have we have trust and faith in local
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
school boards to hire the person I don't
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
need it I don't think in this part-time
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
situation that the state needs to start
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
specifying all kinds of criteria let the
 
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
local school boards have the control to
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
to to go through the applications to
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
hire the the best candidate without hard
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh requirements um again we're talking
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
about a part-time position and and if we
 
00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:06.919 align:start position:0%
get down to 20 we're talking about a
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
very limited part-time position um again
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
I I don't think it's necessary for us to
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
create that I I would expect that any
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
school board that's going to hire
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
somebody will develop a policy
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
underneath their own that will set some
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
of this criteria for what they require
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
um but I don't think the state needs to
 
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:24.870 align:start position:0%
um but I don't think the state needs to
do

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
this and if you talking about for
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
example the welder
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
probably is not going to have a
 
00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree may or may not but
 
00:18:36.149 --> 00:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
obviously is extremely skilled in the
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
area that he or she will be teaching we
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
already have that provision in Career
 
00:18:40.559 --> 00:18:41.510 align:start position:0%
already have that provision in Career
Technical

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
Technical
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
education right but again as alternative
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
certification but again what what
 
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
happens if you're teaching in a regular
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
high school I go back to the electrician
 
00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
the carpenter the auto mechanics some
 
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
schools don't go to CTS and still have
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
those programs that may want to hire a
 
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:55.240 align:start position:0%
carpenter to come in what exam are you
 
00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
going to give to a carpenter for a
 
00:18:59.950 --> 00:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
part-time position
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
and we have alternative certification
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
routes again at the state level high
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
school for any level through 12 where
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
you work one we extended that to two
 
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
years in the past I believe the past
 
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
year uh to attain that alternative
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
certification and then you're also
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
enrolled in a teacher prep program of
 
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
some kind in that area my my concern is
 
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
that the the area for example if you're
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
you're have a shortage in let's say
 
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
social studies Civic
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
and you have a person that's come in
 
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
that's got a Bachelor's degree in social
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
studies or history and government or
 
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
some related field economics or
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
geography um then that person obviously
 
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
has a background in that skill knowledge
 
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
area that is to me a bar which raises it
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
up over the person who's coming and says
 
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
I've done this and done that and that
 
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:55.710 align:start position:0%
I've done this and done that and that
but

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
there's there's no real accountability
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
that they done all that is
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
there so the question is do you trust
 
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
your school board far it out to the
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate people right so is a school
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
board going to hire a person with a
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
sociology degree to teach physics I'm
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
pretty sure I I would trust that my
 
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
school boards are not going to do that
 
00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:15.799 align:start position:0%
and that they're not going to provide
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
those kind of things I trust my school
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
boards to make those determinations
 
00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:20.919 align:start position:0%
right these are elected leaders that are
 
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
there to to um to uh make sure that our
 
00:20:27.549 --> 00:20:27.559 align:start position:0%
students get the best education possible
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
so are they going to hire sociology uh
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
person with a sociology to teach physics
 
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
I would say no I trust that they will
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
not do that I don't think they need a
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
state directive and a state mandate to
 
00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:42.710 align:start position:0%
state directive and a state mandate to
do

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
that where is this going to stop where
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
where is it going to stop are we going
 
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
to then have other categories like you
 
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
need a chemistry teacher and we're just
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
going to open it up to anybody that can
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
come in and say I can teach chemistry or
 
00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:56.919 align:start position:0%
we have requirements now that you be
 
00:20:59.789 --> 00:20:59.799 align:start position:0%
certified in that area you take the
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
practice examination in that
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
area so we there is a standard that will
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
parallel the academic standards which we
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
have in place uh I'm having a hard time
 
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.750 align:start position:0%
have in place uh I'm having a hard time
swallowing

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
swallowing
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
this well it seems to me if you're
 
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
talking about a special area like
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
chemistry obviously you need to have
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
experience in chemistry maybe even a
 
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
baloria degree in chemistry or maybe
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
having worked in a chemistry situation
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
for years and years and years and you
 
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
know it inside out but I would imagine
 
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
that somebody's teaching chemistry will
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
have had a baloran
 
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
degree academic preparation in that
 
00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.950 align:start position:0%
degree academic preparation in that
subject

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
subject
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
matter Senator P you had your hand up
 
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
too a while I know we're here to discuss
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
this the um Senate's position on this
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
has passed I just want to offer as one
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
of my um fellow confer has noted that
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
you know I have a minority position on
 
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
this that some of the U some of the
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
concerns that you brought up repres pres
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
lad aligned with some of the concerns
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
that I had about the amount of time um
 
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
and calling them teachers when there's a
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
teacher certification required on one
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
side and NW and this is this position
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
getting a hall pass I think the original
 
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
intent of this was was good that if you
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
have someone in your community
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
especially the smaller communities that
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
has a specialty like you know we talked
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
about say you know specialty in arts a
 
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
specialty in a certain you know cultural
 
00:22:27.789 --> 00:22:27.799 align:start position:0%
educational area that you want to bring
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
into the classroom somebody who's done
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
computer has computer skills that they
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
can't locate a teacher to do or need to
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
augment the education I can see the
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
value in that but I think that where
 
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
you're starting to line up is along the
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
lines of is it a teacher or is it not a
 
00:22:45.549 --> 00:22:45.559 align:start position:0%
teacher um so I just wanted to bring
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
that it's not that those things were not
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
discussed there was disagreement on them
 
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:57.789 --> 00:22:57.799 align:start position:0%
discussed representative uh Luna uh
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and um just
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
as um Senator Lang talked about majority
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
and minority positions um uh in fact in
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
the house there was only there was no
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
minority position um on this the uh the
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
house bill uh was recommended ought to
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
pass out a committee a 20 nothing and
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
was voted up on the consent calendar and
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
I think given the um given the impact
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
that that uh that this type of
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
legislation would have across the state
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
for all School District districts and I
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
agree with what Senator Lane was talking
 
00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:33.559 align:start position:0%
about that that um that that districts
 
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
do in some cases have challenges um
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
finding um um uh finding teachers and
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
for certain areas uh just as what
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
Senator Apprentice was uh was saying as
 
00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:47.799 align:start position:0%
well that uh that the house uh position
 
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
does provide uh local school boards with
 
00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:53.799 align:start position:0%
the flexibility in in in Senator Lang's
 
00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
initial um uh uh scenario where um where
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
somebody needed to be um you know they'
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
they've got they've got halftime
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
requirements well the 20 hours in the uh
 
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
in the house version provides for that
 
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
but at the same time it also um helps to
 
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
assure the high standards and high
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
quality that um that that um that people
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
across the granite state hardworking
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters expect to find in their
 
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
Public Schools um um again 20 to nothing
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
the house was behind it um and uh and
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
I'd say if we want to give this a try
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
something much closer to the house
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
position would be uh would be would be
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
maybe something that um that could be
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
introduced and the effective date is is
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
right I
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
think uh July 1 2025 I I I still I have
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
one more other question for the
 
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
Department um on one a there Roman 1A it
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
talks about uh in a local or Statewide
 
00:24:59.950 --> 00:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage content
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
area does the department decare teacher
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
shortage areas does the local the local
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
Administration can declare they have a
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
shortage communicate that with you can
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
you tell explain the process to me
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
please yes uh thank you chair um so
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
there are actually there's two different
 
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
critical shortage designations there's a
 
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
Statewide and that's based on a survey
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
that the department conducts every
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
October of all the districts and
 
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
position they've had trouble filling um
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
so we do a Statewide
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
list however there's a statutory
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
provision and I don't remember the
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
statute off the top of my head I
 
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
apologize that says that a local school
 
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
board May declare a local shortage and
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
notify the department that they have
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
declared the local shortage so if they
 
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
can't get a physics teacher let's say in
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
Franklin Franklin can declare a local
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
critical shortage not the school board
 
00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
would vote on it they notify us that
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
they've done this and then what that
 
00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
does is it lowers um it lowers the entry
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
bar into the alternative pathway the
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
site based licensing pathway it doesn't
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
change the end the end is still up here
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
but it does require less to come in into
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
the site into that alternative pathway
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
so and it matches the state if we had
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
declared one Statewide that's that's
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
what I thought was in statute and my my
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
concern in if that portion of that a is
 
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.310 align:start position:0%
concern in if that portion of that a is
left

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
left
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
off uh then we are
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
in conflict with what we have in statute
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
to a degree but it's also leaving I
 
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
believe uh this if this were to
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
pass to allow this
 
00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility to hire folks in a job I
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
understand Senator Lang's perspective
 
00:26:54.669 --> 00:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
where the local school board will make
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
the decision that we need this but I am
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
concerned that um this came about as the
 
00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage which we had during the
 
00:27:07.549 --> 00:27:07.559 align:start position:0%
pandemic and we were looking at how can
 
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
we alleviate it's also coming up out as
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
a result of we have folks coming out of
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
the community college system to teach
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
that don't have a credential of any kind
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
so therefore are not allowed to teach in
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
the school which is a concern if I were
 
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
administrator I'd let them lease the
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
room for a dollar a year and we'd have
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
it done
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
but uh I I think that we have to have
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
some criteria or else I think there's
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
room for
 
00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:42.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
legislation represent
 
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
Hall I would just say that the Senate
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
version to me weakened the teaching
 
00:27:51.509 --> 00:27:51.519 align:start position:0%
profession and it's and it's not good
 
00:27:51.519 --> 00:27:53.950 align:start position:0%
profession and it's and it's not good
for

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
kids so again I I'm going to use
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
especially given the house language of
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
you know there has to be a certified
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
shortage of some sort before you can
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
start stepping into the part-time
 
00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
position um again does not give local
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
school boards flexibility what if I just
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
need to teach I have a full-time math
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
teacher I have one more algebra one
 
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
class I got to fill it's not exactly a
 
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
shortage I'm not going to declare a
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
shortage because I need to add for my
 
00:28:18.909 --> 00:28:18.919 align:start position:0%
high school course I have too many kids
 
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
that want to take it and I need to add
 
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
one more class that's not going to I'm
 
00:28:23.509 --> 00:28:23.519 align:start position:0%
not going to declare shortage on that
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
but then I wouldn't be able to hire
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
someone who might be able to teach that
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
that on a part-time basis because the
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
shortage won't won't be declared unless
 
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
every time we have a vacancy the school
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
board's going to immediately vote I I
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
just want you to consider the amount of
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
hurdles we putting in front of local
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
school boards be able to fill needs
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
within their District um and and why
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
again um in certain that we don't trust
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
local school boards to be able to make
 
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.590 align:start position:0%
local school boards to be able to make
these

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
determinations um the Senate's putting
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
full faith and trust in local school
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
boards to be able to say I'm they're
 
00:28:54.909 --> 00:28:54.919 align:start position:0%
going to do what's in the best interest
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
of schools and if they don't have a
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
qualified candidate they won't fill the
 
00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:58.710 align:start position:0%
qualified candidate they won't fill the
position

00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
and we believe that I don't think the
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
state needs to step in and make that
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
determination on the part-time basis for
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
these part-time positions that may be
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
only one math class or one art class or
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
one Comm uh uh computer science class
 
00:29:15.389 --> 00:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
why does a state need to step in if the
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
local school board can make that
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
determination in in amongst themselves
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
if we trust them to make that
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
determination if we don't trust them
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
then I understand why you say we need
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
the state to step in and create a an
 
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
issuance of an adjunct authorization
 
00:29:30.509 --> 00:29:30.519 align:start position:0%
and have a new requirement at the state
 
00:29:32.669 --> 00:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
level uh for that but I trust that
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to make these decisions
 
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
I trust our local uh voters to vote the
 
00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
people who are responsible for education
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
in I trust those people who are voted in
 
00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:44.519 align:start position:0%
to make the best determination for the
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
district and for the
 
00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
students are you willing to go into
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
caucus and consider leaving a in taking
 
00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
in that's a new question question if
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
you're in charge of Mr Mr chair yeah Ju
 
00:30:03.389 --> 00:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
Just just before that just to address
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
what Senator Lang was was talking about
 
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
you know so so I served on a school
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
board for 12 years chaired it for eight
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
years and uh and occasionally we did um
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh have to fill a um a one class uh
 
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
position so we would offer a um uh a
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
plus contract to an existing full-time
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
teacher to uh to take that uh take that
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
class so school boards already have the
 
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:31.039 align:start position:0%
um the the the the tools and the
 
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
capability to to f fulfill teaching of a
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
class with an existing full-time um
 
00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:40.519 align:start position:0%
teacher with a plus with a plus contract
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
and do so um to you know making sure
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
that um that students are receiving high
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
quality education and doesn't require
 
00:30:50.909 --> 00:30:50.919 align:start position:0%
any change in the current law to be able
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
to um to do that now so um um so you
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
know just saying that that that I think
 
00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
the um the
 
00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:05.559 align:start position:0%
the the policy that that is contained in
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
the house bill provides the the
 
00:31:11.549 --> 00:31:11.559 align:start position:0%
flexibility beyond that beyond that that
 
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:15.559 align:start position:0%
one additional class um to uh to be able
 
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
to address the needs of um of districts
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
and uh and I'd love to see us um you
 
00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
know stand on that as uh as the outcome
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
here follow yes so what what happens if
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh existing teacher doesn't want to
 
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
teach it there's nobody in the school
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
district that says I want to teach this
 
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
class I've got my plates full I have
 
00:31:36.909 --> 00:31:36.919 align:start position:0%
enough stuff going on in my life I don't
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
want to teach it you know I think that's
 
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
that's a question I um I didn't see it
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
at all in my 12 years on the U the
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hopkinson board um uh I I certainly
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
can't rule out that uh that that um that
 
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
that hasn't happened um anywhere but I
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
think there's probably some flexibility
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
there through um through alt
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
certifications or some sort of uh you
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
know um uh exception that could be uh
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
granted through the uh through the the
 
00:32:08.909 --> 00:32:08.919 align:start position:0%
board of through the um through the
 
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
State Board uh through the department of
 
00:32:14.629 --> 00:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
Ed uh that uh that ensures that we're um
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
that we're you know providing high
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
quality instruction to um to our
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
students more follow up yes go ahead so
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
again so with your 12 years on hopon
 
00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:27.559 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard did you ever fire a teacher
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
that's your was certified by the Board
 
00:32:28.799 --> 00:32:33.710 align:start position:0%
that's your was certified by the Board
of

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
Education or non-renew a
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
contract sure I mean we've we've
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
non-renewed contracts I mean I I um uh
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
certainly believe in and you U you you
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
staff accordingly and um and when when
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
we've seen you know uh growth and and
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
and dips in in enrollment we would
 
00:32:57.149 --> 00:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
certainly um staff accordingly uh on all
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
that but but but um but in in in in my
 
00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
experience I think those are those are
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
done through through riffs obviously but
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
you try to try to manage your your
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
Staffing through other you know ways of
 
00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
doing it too Rift would be would be made
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
sort of a last resort uh on that but um
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
but you know also in my experience as a
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
as a parent um you know certainly our
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
kids had um had their favorite teachers
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
and their less favorite teachers and
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
that might rub off on parents but what I
 
00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:35.559 align:start position:0%
learned being on the board was that some
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
of maybe my kids less favorite teachers
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
happen to be other kids most favorite
 
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
teachers so it's it's it's hard for me
 
00:33:47.629 --> 00:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
to say as a as a as a parent that has
 
00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard experience that uh that that
 
00:33:54.269 --> 00:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
just one perspective on on on
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
on on a teacher is uh is enough
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
again my my only point was it's not an
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
absolute a certification from the
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is not an
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
absolute that this is a great teacher is
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
this is even a good teacher right that's
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
not an absolute statement and that's
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
what this bill is seeking the Senate
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
version of this bill is recognizing is
 
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
that it's not an absolute statement that
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
it's not just because a a teacher has a
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
certification doesn't absolutely mean
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be a phenomenal
 
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
teacher in my school or even a good
 
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
teacher in my school and again on the
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
school board I can tell you that we
 
00:34:27.069 --> 00:34:27.079 align:start position:0%
non-renewed contracts for poor
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
performance right that that especially
 
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
in the before they reach tenure right
 
00:34:33.149 --> 00:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
someone who came into the profession
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
this bill is seeking to recognize that
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
again you don't need a certification to
 
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
be a good teacher you can be a good
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
teacher without a certification
 
00:34:43.069 --> 00:34:43.079 align:start position:0%
especially in certain content areas
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
where certification isn't necessarily
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
required um and may you may have an
 
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
alternative teacher path but why do we
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
need to have the state involvement in
 
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
the conversation why can't a local
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
school board who has the best interest
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
of the their students in mind be able to
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
find somebody who doesn't isn't a
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
full-time certified teacher doesn't want
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
to go down the alternative teacher path
 
00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:05.240 align:start position:0%
but they're willing to step in and teach
 
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
one class two class three classes for
 
00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
the school district across possibly
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
multiple districts um I I think that the
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
state should allow that flexibility
 
00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
again it helps the teacher shortage um
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
that we have now to allow some of these
 
00:35:20.109 --> 00:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
one-offs like I said to where you have
 
00:35:22.109 --> 00:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
that that plus one contract and nobody
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
wants it I can bring in maybe my local
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
CPA who might be able to teach a basic
 
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
algebra 1 course if I bet if I if I go
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
through the process doesn't need to go
 
00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
to the board of education for that um we
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
want to allow that flexibility at the
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
local level so we don't have all these
 
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
administrative and governmental hurdles
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
for school districts to get the best uh
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
outcome for their teach for their
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
students yes repesent follow up on on
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
your comment about the overages um in my
 
00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
district they were fought over you know
 
00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:56.200 align:start position:0%
how come you gave them an orage and not
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
me that was the the the problem wasn't
 
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
that there weren't people to fill them
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
the problem was there were too many
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
people that wanted that orage you know
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
teachers always looking to make more
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
money and they they willingly from my
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
experience accept that position for the
 
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
point point an extra point
 
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
to that's not a problem okay we're going
 
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
to go into Cox I just want to make one
 
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
comment because uh what I saw as an
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
administrator in schools during the time
 
00:36:24.309 --> 00:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
I supervised and managed hundreds and
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
hundreds of of Staff members across this
 
00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.349 align:start position:0%
hundreds of of Staff members across this
country

00:36:28.349 --> 00:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
and during the time that I was there I
 
00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:35.079 align:start position:0%
recommended non- retention to the board
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
on 13 tenured
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
teachers and that happens if you go
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
through needs improvement process if you
 
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
go through evaluation process and do
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
things correctly yes in any profession
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
there are folks which are not cutting
 
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
the mustard certainly if I'm going to go
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
to a surgeon and deal with putting a
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
stint in I'm going to try to find the
 
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
best surgeon I can and that
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
certification means something to me um
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
last lastly there's a small District up
 
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
my way has about 67 kids in it and the
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
library happens to be across the street
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
in a public library where the person has
 
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.190 align:start position:0%
in a public library where the person has
no

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
certification however that librarian
 
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
knows the community knows what's in that
 
00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:16.839 align:start position:0%
Library uh loves literature and and and
 
00:37:20.109 --> 00:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
and top-notch in technology as well this
 
00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
bill would help provide that
 
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
authorization that they need so they
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
rather than having to hire a librarian
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
within the school when they don't have
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
the resources they can use the librarian
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
across the
 
00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.790 align:start position:0%
across the
street

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
street
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
so so we we'll break in the caucus right
 
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
now this what I thought we're talking
 
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
about part-time teachers right
 
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
now I wonder how many of the part-time
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
teachers will come in to help out are
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
they actually trying to become full-time
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
teachers do they want to continue teach
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
or may they maybe they're just doing
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
this for an additional experience or to
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know to to try something different
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
they may not necessarily continue as a
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
as a teacher yeah substitute teachers
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
some are contracted sometimes you have a
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
a contracted individual that's going to
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
be a full-time sub within a school
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
district and they just go from school to
 
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
school in certain days the rest of them
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
are not contracted Personnel don't come
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
under the negotiated agreement at all um
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
they their salary is set by the school
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
board it might be 25 bucks a day 75
 
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
bucks a day whatever 100 whatever the
 
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
going rate is so uh I I think that's a a
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
different area that we're trying to
 
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
address here than within this particular
 
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
legislation let's go to caucus I gotta
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
run to another COC okay upstairs all
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
right I'll try to get back if you're
 
00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
still at it okay thank you very much
 
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
Senator okay we'll go on cus we have the
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
rooms right across the hallway we have
 
00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:26.349 align:start position:0%
 
officers

00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:26.359 align:start position:0%

00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
okay let let's go ahead and start I know
 
00:58:28.109 --> 00:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
that some people were already they'll
 
00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
come back and I know Senator Apprentice
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
had to leave
 
00:58:35.069 --> 00:58:35.079 align:start position:0%
um what what the house would like to
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
propose and we have one area we'd like
 
00:58:41.029 --> 00:58:41.039 align:start position:0%
to propose and then a second which we'd
 
00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
like to uh
 
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
discuss um leaving the house version as
 
00:58:48.119 --> 00:58:50.230 align:start position:0%
discuss um leaving the house version as
is

00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.109 align:start position:0%
is
with

00:58:52.109 --> 00:58:52.119 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
um part a
 
00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.190 align:start position:0%
um part a
remaining

00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
remaining
 
00:59:02.549 --> 00:59:02.559 align:start position:0%
in taking part B and putting a period
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
after the field of authorization
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
period and leaving c as
 
00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
is and the rest of the bill as is that's
 
00:59:16.109 --> 00:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
with change of effective date oh with
 
00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:19.720 align:start position:0%
effective date change yes
 
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:22.039 align:start position:0%
um what would we have the effective date
 
00:59:28.029 --> 00:59:28.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
that's that the other if this is not
 
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
palatable then we do have an issue which
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
we really would like to address and it
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
brought about part of the rationale for
 
00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
putting this bill forward uh we take the
 
00:59:43.319 --> 00:59:44.430 align:start position:0%
putting this bill forward uh we take the
Senate

00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
version dealing with part-time
 
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
teacher and write this so that we
 
00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:56.440 align:start position:0%
can allow the adjunct
 
00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
and teacher teaching staff instructional
 
01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:01.720 align:start position:0%
staff that has the master's degrees at
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
the community college system in the
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
University of system New Hampshire to be
 
01:00:09.309 --> 01:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
able to come down and work in the
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
schools uh 20 hours per week or that
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
part's a little bit for du andr for dual
 
01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:17.960 align:start position:0%
and concurrent enrollment right now they
 
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
can't do that we have a significant
 
01:00:22.109 --> 01:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
problem in our larger cities regarding
 
01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
that right now I.E Manchester and I
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
think that's been communicated to us is
 
01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:27.750 align:start position:0%
think that's been communicated to us is
that

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
correct Mr applebe pardon
 
01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:37.309 align:start position:0%
correct Mr applebe pardon
me

01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.549 --> 01:00:41.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.079 --> 01:00:47.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
yeah so that that's that this is an area
 
01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
that it was brought up in our
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
discussions when we passed this thing
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
out of the committee uh in education
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
here in the house and it it's part of
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
the rationale we we also support the
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
other side of the coin there that's why
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
we're offering the first oper you know
 
01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
change here taking out part of B but if
 
01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
that's not palatable we'd like to really
 
01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
just change some quick word smithing and
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
also require for the adjunct to have the
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
criminal background
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
check from the college system that may
 
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
one B totally that paragraph no after
 
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
the word authorization stop right there
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
the individual must have earned a
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree or hire with a major
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
in or related to the field of
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
and if that doesn't work we'd like to
 
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
propose to uh aced to the Senate version
 
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
by amending it to reflect what we need
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
for the community higher education to do
 
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
their uh their class we'd have to get
 
01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
the wording from Mr applebe here because
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's just obviously not just concurrent
 
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment it's other courses which
 
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
are taught by them in our
 
01:02:25.269 --> 01:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
schools so it's it's it's courses that
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
that lead to college
 
01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
credit that's correct so no no let's
 
01:02:34.829 --> 01:02:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:38.029 --> 01:02:38.039 align:start position:0%
that thank you it's actually now become
 
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
even in critical shortage areas Franklin
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
is is partner with Lakes Region
 
01:02:44.589 --> 01:02:44.599 align:start position:0%
Community College to cover some of their
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
classes at the high school with
 
01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
Community College faculty so it's not
 
01:02:51.549 --> 01:02:51.559 align:start position:0%
only college credit now it's
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
actually and it works out well for the
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
college because now they can keep an
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
instructor busy full
 
01:02:58.990 --> 01:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
Time by having them maybe teach a period
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
or two at the high school and the rest
 
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
of the time at the
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
college inter it's a sharing of
 
01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
resources I see what you're saying so
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
follow so I clarify this I I I'm not
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
going to speak for of word but the first
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
option is an option for me so I'll look
 
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
at I said the first option you outlined
 
01:03:16.269 --> 01:03:16.279 align:start position:0%
is not an option for for me but the
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
second option I'll consider is your idea
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
that we would basically say that if
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
you're an instructor at the University
 
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
of Si New Hampshire or a community
 
01:03:27.269 --> 01:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
college system of Hampshire you're
 
01:03:29.069 --> 01:03:29.079 align:start position:0%
eligible to teach without a teaching
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
certification within the within the
 
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
public school system is that theet
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
statement making and with criminal
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
background check that right but again
 
01:03:39.269 --> 01:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
Senate position already has that if we
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
just added to the Senate position and
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
it's an incremental improvement from
 
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
what it is it allows for 30 hour
 
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
part-time teach up to
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
20 didn't you say that representa yeah
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
yeah we we we stayed with the 20 on even
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
with the adjunct Steve does that work
 
01:03:58.589 --> 01:03:58.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
so cons The Ward and I go confirm for a
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
little bit yeah and if you're if you're
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
good with that we can probably get Mr
 
01:04:09.789 --> 01:04:09.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:16.349 --> 01:04:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
Steve just to be clear again so make
 
01:04:20.109 --> 01:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
sure sen the ward I are talk about the
 
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
same thing we're going to adopt Senate
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
language with a new I'm going to call it
 
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 3 reing Roman numeral
 
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
three to four and it would say something
 
01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
along the lines of in
 
01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
um that instructors at the University
 
01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
system of or the community college
 
01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
system shall be eligible to teach in
 
01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
public school system without a state
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
credential or language to that effect
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
just to just to be clear I don't know if
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's instructors or what the because I
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
think there
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
are different levels of of um people who
 
01:04:57.269 --> 01:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
provide instruction at the college level
 
01:04:59.069 --> 01:04:59.079 align:start position:0%
I'll consult with both systems to get
 
01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
the wording correct um and I assume you
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
want this like by
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
tomorrow okay yeah yeah I'll make a
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
couple of calls and get the wording
 
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
right and and my understanding that
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
we're we're talking about um you know uh
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
professionals at these at you know
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
whether they're professional full-time
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
faculty or adjunct faculty that they are
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
um they're they're they're credentialed
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
at that
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
they they let me let me say another way
 
01:05:31.269 --> 01:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
that they that they have the credentials
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
um to be able to teach in these their
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
college classes yes that would be the
 
01:05:38.029 --> 01:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
that would be the intention they
 
01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be down here working in our
 
01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
schools unless they had that Masters in
 
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
that subject area
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah and I and I I I I I think that's
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
what we're that's what we're going after
 
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
but I think May there may be some we
 
01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
have to be careful though because Sno
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
requires bachelors
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
and schools are using
 
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
Snoop for their running start concurrent
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment e start all
 
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
that yeah
 
01:06:09.789 --> 01:06:09.799 align:start position:0%
I I guess let's on the ward first and I
 
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
talk about whether or not we can accept
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
that position because if you can't then
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to send H down chasing
 
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
language but but you know but we may
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
want to be cautious if we want to limit
 
01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:21.640 align:start position:0%
it only to our seven schools and three
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
fouryear I I'm being I'm good with that
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know we should pushing concurrent
 
01:06:28.589 --> 01:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment with our system not
 
01:06:35.269 --> 01:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
Snoop I only have 20 minutes before my
 
01:06:42.269 --> 01:06:42.279 align:start position:0%
next come yeah you and us together we
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
back 11:30 11 I'm gent my one my one
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
with a house with Glen tur committee
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
took all five minutes great well L
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
lenn's pretty good with that you
 
01:06:54.520 --> 01:07:24.510 align:start position:0%
lenn's pretty good with that you
know

01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:54.430 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.440 --> 01:08:24.430 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:54.430 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:54.440 --> 01:09:24.349 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:54.310 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.320 --> 01:10:24.310 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:54.229 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
right Mr chair if I may go ahead so the
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
Senate would agree to drop the hours to
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
20 um we agreed to the criminal
 
01:11:53.629 --> 01:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
background check for for part-time
 
01:11:55.870 --> 01:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
teachers uh we agreed to the code of
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
conduct being subject to the codee of
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
conduct for part-time teachers and we
 
01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
agree that all of those Provisions would
 
01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
only apply to instructors from the
 
01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
University system of the Hampshire or
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
the community colleges of New Hampshire
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
who will now be eligible to be able to
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
teach in our Public Schools without
 
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.229 align:start position:0%
teach in our Public Schools without
further

01:12:11.229 --> 01:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
credentialing that's what we would agree
 
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
to yep we're good with that it's going
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
to be written by uh Mr Mr Apple be and
 
01:12:22.669 --> 01:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
we should have the draft by three
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
o'clock today yeah I I'm I'm generally
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
good with good with this I'm I'm I'm
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
cons I'm very concerned about the um the
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
the the language that how it applies to
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
which faculty members would be um would
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
would have the credentials with which to
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
language Mr app I'm going to consult
 
01:12:53.149 --> 01:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
with both systems but it would be my
 
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
expectation that it would it would refer
 
01:12:58.669 --> 01:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
to this as faculty members of either
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
system um so as to not miss a particular
 
01:13:05.229 --> 01:13:05.239 align:start position:0%
designation that they have for someone
 
01:13:07.229 --> 01:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the credential involved
 
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
certainly at the four-year level it's
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
almost always the case that if you're
 
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
teaching a bachelor's level you need a
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
master's and at the community college
 
01:13:16.629 --> 01:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
level I will check on what their
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
requirements are there could be
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
instances where an auto mechanic at
 
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
nhti may not have a degree but that
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
would be okay our CTE centers today so
 
01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
that's already available in the CTE so
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
we don't got to go that route all we
 
01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
need to do is ensure that these people
 
01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
are are are teaching and instructing in
 
01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:38.679 align:start position:0%
the public schools a course that's
 
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
recognized as concurrent dual enrollment
 
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
or some other such type program
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
where or are you talking about just
 
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
filling a hole that's not we're we're
 
01:13:49.229 --> 01:13:49.239 align:start position:0%
just opening it up to make them eligible
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
to teach a part-time class regardless
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
what the subject matter is if they're if
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
they're an instructor at the University
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
system or nhti so again that one math
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
class they might be teaching AP Physics
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
right AP Physics is a great example and
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
that's needed yes and so just allowed
 
01:14:05.709 --> 01:14:05.719 align:start position:0%
any any faculty from those two systems
 
01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
would be able to come into the school
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
and teach or be contracted to teach or
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
be an employ part-time employee without
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
having to go to the board of education
 
01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
to go chase down now they sort of that's
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
good in my district right now some of
 
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
the AP courses are taught online it'd be
 
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
good to have one of those bodies in the
 
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
classroom eyeball to eyeball my my
 
01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
concern is that you know that I want
 
01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
these people to be faculty members not
 
01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
teaching assistants not PhD students
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
that are providing first year
 
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
instruction to uh you know first year
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
students that that they're so you know
 
01:14:39.149 --> 01:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
with all these different levels at the
 
01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
higher education in higher education
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
that that are providing instruction that
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
it's not all of them it's not a grad
 
01:14:48.189 --> 01:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
student who's a teaching assistant
 
01:14:51.149 --> 01:14:51.159 align:start position:0%
specific you know group thank you can
 
01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
you convey that to Mark Rubenstein and
 
01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
to Kathy yes thank
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you okay thank you so we we
 
01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
are agreeing with that and uh we'll move
 
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
forward with the concurring with what we
 
01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:05.719 align:start position:0%
so you'll write up we'll write up a COC
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
report yeah doing that we'll get in
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
advance just in case we need to tweak a
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
little bit of something but signature is
 
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
the vote Yes yeah yeah we can see it
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
today yeah
 
01:15:19.709 --> 01:15:19.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for attending

01:29:03.109 --> 01:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
well well I'm going to go ahead and
 
01:29:04.669 --> 01:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
start we're right we're right at this
 
01:29:06.910 --> 01:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
time 11:30 we're absent one on our side
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
but that's fine um so we're here today
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
continuing from a recess HB 1665 this is
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
the uh bill that's dealing with the
 
01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
education Freedom
 
01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
accounts and
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
um let's continue our conversation here
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Lang is there any movement
 
01:29:32.590 --> 01:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
sure so the Senate the Senate would
 
01:29:36.590 --> 01:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
agree to some um minor amendments um if
 
01:29:39.070 --> 01:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
if the house agrees to them um in
 
01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:41.719 align:start position:0%
section three the phaseout grants
 
01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
will'll will'll agree to reduce it to um
 
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
just a two-year extension instead of a
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
three-year extension go so going to 2028
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
instead of 2029 so that reduces the
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
extension from the current law that's
 
01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
going to expire and we would agree to
 
01:29:59.550 --> 01:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
strip section five completely from the
 
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
bill which is the adma
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
language and if you agree to that I
 
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
think we'll have signatures for
 
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
everybody okay we're going to take a
 
01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
us

01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:52.920 --> 01:31:22.910 align:start position:0%

okay I want to confirm one thing here
 
01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:55.239 align:start position:0%
the um the proposal put forth by the
 
01:33:58.430 --> 01:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
Senate has been to leave the 400% that
 
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
being the top percentage that you're
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
moving towards and to look at the phase
 
01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
out drop that to two
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
years correct drop it from currently it

says 2029 in the on the on the CATE
 
01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:16.360 align:start position:0%
version we drop it to 2028 okay the the
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
house uh position on that is we non-c

05:06:28.628 --> 05:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
no this is yeah this is yours I um
 
05:06:30.708 --> 05:06:30.718 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley
 
05:06:33.750 --> 05:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
is in another Committee of conference
 
05:06:35.510 --> 05:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
Senator avard I think told us he was
 
05:06:36.670 --> 05:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
going to be in
 
05:06:38.948 --> 05:06:38.958 align:start position:0%
DC sorry I accidentally turned yours off
 
05:06:40.910 --> 05:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
I was trying to turn mine on oh sorry
 
05:06:43.788 --> 05:06:43.798 align:start position:0%
yes yes so I think it's just me okay
 
05:06:46.150 --> 05:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
wonderful um so with this I will reopen
 
05:06:47.670 --> 05:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
the committee the conference committee
 
05:06:49.150 --> 05:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
on house bill
 
05:06:51.350 --> 05:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
1278 um I was looking to see if we'd
 
05:06:52.948 --> 05:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
have two of our Senate colleagues but
 
05:06:54.670 --> 05:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
I'm very happy to have Senator Whitley
 
05:06:58.310 --> 05:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
here um as as I'm not sure if everybody
 
05:07:01.190 --> 05:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
is aware Senate Bill 499 which has been
 
05:07:04.470 --> 05:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
was added to House Bill 1278 plus
 
05:07:08.310 --> 05:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
another section um so $499 was accepted
 
05:07:10.868 --> 05:07:10.878 align:start position:0%
along with um a paired down version of
 
05:07:14.590 --> 05:07:14.600 align:start position:0%
the roads bill um in um just previously
 
05:07:16.030 --> 05:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
so that part is already there it's
 
05:07:17.868 --> 05:07:17.878 align:start position:0%
already headed to law and I don't
 
05:07:19.510 --> 05:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
believe that there'll be any challenges
 
05:07:22.788 --> 05:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
having it through um so that language is
 
05:07:26.590 --> 05:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
already established um the question the
 
05:07:29.470 --> 05:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
the house will not acceed to the half a
 
05:07:31.750 --> 05:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars in spending that had
 
05:07:34.270 --> 05:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
been defeated previously in the house it
 
05:07:36.150 --> 05:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
is not the house position to add a half
 
05:07:39.190 --> 05:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
a million dollars in um school funding
 
05:07:41.788 --> 05:07:41.798 align:start position:0%
and uh quite frankly not having it on a
 
05:07:43.350 --> 05:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
committee Bill where we had people
 
05:07:45.150 --> 05:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
involved in that in the first place
 
05:07:47.070 --> 05:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
makes it even more challenging to accept
 
05:07:50.708 --> 05:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
that change um so because that language
 
05:07:52.628 --> 05:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
because the language in the rest of the
 
05:07:54.750 --> 05:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
bill in sections four and five were
 
05:07:56.628 --> 05:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
already accepted in another conference
 
05:07:57.830 --> 05:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
committee that should have smooth
 
05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
sailing and the fact that the house is
 
05:08:03.590 --> 05:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
rejecting section three um we would seek
 
05:08:05.590 --> 05:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
the Senate to reced from their Amendment
 
05:08:08.230 --> 05:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
and to and to exceed to the house
 
05:08:11.270 --> 05:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
position thank for that I mean I I I
 
05:08:13.350 --> 05:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
think everyone is very clear now what
 
05:08:16.070 --> 05:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
this house position is on $
 
05:08:19.270 --> 05:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
499 and I I think the Senate's proposal
 
05:08:23.230 --> 05:08:23.240 align:start position:0%
at this point is to retain the portions
 
05:08:25.910 --> 05:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
that the house has already assed to on
 
05:08:29.390 --> 05:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
499 keep that on 1278 I don't want to
 
05:08:31.750 --> 05:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
call it an insurance policy but they're
 
05:08:36.110 --> 05:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
I think uh just cleare eyed that these
 
05:08:38.830 --> 05:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
are two policies just those two in the
 
05:08:41.110 --> 05:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
tor schem Amendment $ 499 House and
 
05:08:43.628 --> 05:08:43.638 align:start position:0%
Senate are in full agreement so uh the
 
05:08:46.350 --> 05:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
Senate proposal is to retain those on to
 
05:08:47.868 --> 05:08:47.878 align:start position:0%
1278 and I think we can have an
 
05:08:50.670 --> 05:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
agreement there well um thank you I I do
 
05:08:53.390 --> 05:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate that offer to add simply what
 
05:08:55.590 --> 05:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
the house had passed however we already
 
05:08:57.670 --> 05:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
have that language and I don't want to
 
05:09:00.628 --> 05:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
put in Jeopardy the assistance to small
 
05:09:02.430 --> 05:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
towns that need assistance to get their
 
05:09:05.350 --> 05:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
built roads rebuilt I can't imagine that
 
05:09:07.910 --> 05:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
it would be rejected Beyond this stage
 
05:09:09.788 --> 05:09:09.798 align:start position:0%
and I can't imagine that it would move
 
05:09:12.430 --> 05:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
forward through both bodies um so with
 
05:09:14.350 --> 05:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
that you know thank you for the offer
 
05:09:16.590 --> 05:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
however our offer is for the Senate to
 
05:09:19.430 --> 05:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
reced from their Amendment and concur
 
05:09:22.548 --> 05:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
with the house sorry representative
 
05:09:25.990 --> 05:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
Aly yes we may have a problem because
 
05:09:28.750 --> 05:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
there's a certain there's there's been a
 
05:09:30.868 --> 05:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
lot of talk about how the governor would
 
05:09:34.430 --> 05:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
not accept the roads portion and that's
 
05:09:37.230 --> 05:09:37.240 align:start position:0%
where the insurance policy would come
 
05:09:40.110 --> 05:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
in thank you that's why the committee
 
05:09:42.868 --> 05:09:42.878 align:start position:0%
had waited and come back today and I
 
05:09:45.230 --> 05:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
believe that that question is no longer
 
05:09:45.240 --> 05:09:47.390 align:start position:0%
believe that that question is no longer
a

05:09:47.390 --> 05:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:09:50.868 --> 05:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
question I I think the I don't I don't
 
05:09:52.990 --> 05:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
think it's decided I don't I I don't
 
05:09:57.830 --> 05:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:59.830 --> 05:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
indicated I don't I just don't see a
 
05:10:02.830 --> 05:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
downside to retaining two important
 
05:10:04.830 --> 05:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
policies that the House and Senate fully
 
05:10:07.150 --> 05:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
agree on on both I mean there's no
 
05:10:09.548 --> 05:10:09.558 align:start position:0%
disagreement about the policy we there's
 
05:10:11.590 --> 05:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
you know full consensus on that so
 
05:10:12.910 --> 05:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
there's I don't see the downside of
 
05:10:14.470 --> 05:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
doing that because and I also don't
 
05:10:17.350 --> 05:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
think it jeopardizes the disaster relief
 
05:10:19.990 --> 05:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to interrupt
 
05:10:22.868 --> 05:10:22.878 align:start position:0%
you sorry representative Shapiro yes I
 
05:10:24.948 --> 05:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
would also just say that
 
05:10:29.190 --> 05:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
um in speaking to representative Edwards
 
05:10:33.750 --> 05:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
prior to um their session um he was in
 
05:10:35.430 --> 05:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
full agreement with that idea of us
 
05:10:38.670 --> 05:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
keeping this on this bill as well and I
 
05:10:41.270 --> 05:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
I mean I've only heard it um secondhand
 
05:10:43.190 --> 05:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
but I I think that that's true for
 
05:10:45.350 --> 05:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative Earth as
 
05:10:49.190 --> 05:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
well yeah and I will say we did have um
 
05:10:50.830 --> 05:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
representative walner check in with
 
05:10:52.708 --> 05:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
representative F and representative
 
05:10:54.788 --> 05:10:54.798 align:start position:0%
Edwards and I believe they are
 
05:10:58.070 --> 05:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
completely fine um with the addition of
 
05:10:59.670 --> 05:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
adding those two policies that we just
 
05:11:02.150 --> 05:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
agreed on WE negotiated in good faith on
 
05:11:03.548 --> 05:11:03.558 align:start position:0%
that and so they were fine with that is
 
05:11:05.670 --> 05:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
my understanding so my conversations
 
05:11:07.430 --> 05:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
with them were different um my
 
05:11:09.750 --> 05:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
conversations were with them were that
 
05:11:11.510 --> 05:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
those positions were wonderful as long
 
05:11:13.590 --> 05:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
as they went along with the ability to
 
05:11:15.868 --> 05:11:15.878 align:start position:0%
repair the roads in small towns because
 
05:11:17.070 --> 05:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
if you can't get to school for your
 
05:11:18.788 --> 05:11:18.798 align:start position:0%
lunch if you can't get to the the
 
05:11:20.590 --> 05:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
grocery store in order to use your
 
05:11:23.110 --> 05:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
benefits if it's a summerain event we
 
05:11:25.430 --> 05:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
have larger problems we have the ability
 
05:11:28.990 --> 05:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
for that enabling legislation um and
 
05:11:31.070 --> 05:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
while I do understand that over a large
 
05:11:33.070 --> 05:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
big ticket item there may be a risk of
 
05:11:34.868 --> 05:11:34.878 align:start position:0%
it passing both bodies and not
 
05:11:37.030 --> 05:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately succeeding I really don't
 
05:11:40.948 --> 05:11:40.958 align:start position:0%
think a question mark of 25 ,000 raises
 
05:11:42.788 --> 05:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
to that level I do know that there are
 
05:11:46.230 --> 05:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
some other areas where um where quite
 
05:11:48.150 --> 05:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
frankly the Senate is pushing a position
 
05:11:49.868 --> 05:11:49.878 align:start position:0%
where there may be some question some
 
05:11:52.390 --> 05:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
question called into effect as well um I
 
05:11:56.230 --> 05:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
don't I don't believe that holding to
 
05:11:58.110 --> 05:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
the bill as passed by the house without
 
05:12:01.708 --> 05:12:01.718 align:start position:0%
the Senate Amendment um put the the Feed
 
05:12:04.110 --> 05:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
the Children at Risk because I don't
 
05:12:05.910 --> 05:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
believe that that is at risk especially
 
05:12:09.990 --> 05:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
when it is with the roads and um
 
05:12:11.830 --> 05:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
that that is the house position
 
05:12:13.990 --> 05:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative Shir yes I just want to
 
05:12:18.270 --> 05:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
make clear for I think I can speak for
 
05:12:21.270 --> 05:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
um others as well as myself that this
 
05:12:25.230 --> 05:12:25.240 align:start position:0%
that the idea to keep the two um Feed
 
05:12:30.190 --> 05:12:30.200 align:start position:0%
the Children feed food bills food um
 
05:12:34.548 --> 05:12:34.558 align:start position:0%
policies on our bill is in no way in um
 
05:12:36.390 --> 05:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
you know it in no way should be read as
 
05:12:39.750 --> 05:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
us being against the um disaster Relief
 
05:12:42.910 --> 05:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
Fund um in fact you know in the house we
 
05:12:45.510 --> 05:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
voted by we included that in the
 
05:12:47.470 --> 05:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
amendment by a large margin and I
 
05:12:51.190 --> 05:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
certainly voted for it and um so I hope
 
05:12:55.830 --> 05:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
you won't take our um push to keep these
 
05:12:58.788 --> 05:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
food um policies in this bill is in any
 
05:13:01.670 --> 05:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
way being against the disaster relief
 
05:13:05.230 --> 05:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
fund um I think we we all in agreement
 
05:13:07.670 --> 05:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
with that yeah thank you and I think
 
05:13:08.948 --> 05:13:08.958 align:start position:0%
that's why it's a strong position in
 
05:13:10.430 --> 05:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
that that's why I don't think that it's
 
05:13:12.030 --> 05:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
at the same risk that others believe
 
05:13:16.750 --> 05:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
that it is um so actually with that I'm
 
05:13:20.990 --> 05:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
going to I just ask are you on sorry
 
05:13:23.390 --> 05:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
could you put your microphone on sorry
 
05:13:28.190 --> 05:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
are are you taking the whole bill away
 
05:13:31.628 --> 05:13:31.638 align:start position:0%
or are you only are you allowing the
 
05:13:36.270 --> 05:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
this therapeutic cannabis to go forward
 
05:13:39.230 --> 05:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
so by by asking the Senate to reced from
 
05:13:40.590 --> 05:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
their Amendment it would allow the
 
05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis to move forward so
 
05:13:43.750 --> 05:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
that everybody doesn't need to
 
05:13:47.230 --> 05:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
relitigate each of those issues um this
 
05:13:48.990 --> 05:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
is just this is just a point of trying
 
05:13:50.708 --> 05:13:50.718 align:start position:0%
to move away from the complications and
 
05:13:52.788 --> 05:13:52.798 align:start position:0%
piling one bill on top of another I know
 
05:13:54.190 --> 05:13:54.200 align:start position:0%
that we all have the frustrations are
 
05:13:56.070 --> 05:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
conquered and none of at this table will
 
05:13:57.390 --> 05:13:57.400 align:start position:0%
be dealing with the frustrations a
 
05:14:00.190 --> 05:14:00.200 align:start position:0%
little to the south of us which um I I
 
05:14:02.868 --> 05:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
definitely understand but we want to
 
05:14:05.990 --> 05:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:09.470 --> 05:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
position so if um with that if the
 
05:14:12.070 --> 05:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
Senate would like to go ahead um I know
 
05:14:14.708 --> 05:14:14.718 align:start position:0%
that not everybody is here um we will be
 
05:14:17.230 --> 05:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
ready to yeah so I I'm not ready to make
 
05:14:18.670 --> 05:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
that agreement particularly without my
 
05:14:20.150 --> 05:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
colleagues here and so if we want to
 
05:14:23.190 --> 05:14:23.200 align:start position:0%
just recess until tomorrow and that that
 
05:14:24.708 --> 05:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
way I can talk to my other Senate
 
05:14:27.270 --> 05:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues I I can't make uh on behalf
 
05:14:29.948 --> 05:14:29.958 align:start position:0%
of the Senate I can't make I hear your
 
05:14:32.670 --> 05:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
agreement and and I would like to recess
 
05:14:35.310 --> 05:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
and talk with the other members um I
 
05:14:37.628 --> 05:14:37.638 align:start position:0%
will need to see if we oh it's 12 hours
 
05:14:39.750 --> 05:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
so we would be able to do that at some
 
05:14:41.910 --> 05:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
point so I will find and see what times
 
05:14:43.670 --> 05:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
are available I know that the day is
 
05:14:46.470 --> 05:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
stacking up quite well and I will notify
