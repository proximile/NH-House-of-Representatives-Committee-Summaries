good morning everyone and welcome to the
 
00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
house committee on Health and Human
 
00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 align:start position:0%
Services and elderly Affairs we have
 
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
several bills to uh consider this today
 
00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 align:start position:0%
uh in public hearing but before we get
 
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
to that I'd like to ask you to please
 
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
 
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
United States of America and to the
 
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
Republic for which it stands one nation
 
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
under God indivisible with liberty and
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
all thank you everyone the first bill to
 
00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 align:start position:0%
be heard today is house bills 576
 
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
FN and I would recognize the prime
 
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Rosemary rang
 
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
run thank you very much Mr chair and
 
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
thank you committee for um uh allowing
 
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
me to introduce this bill for the record
 
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
my name is Rosemarie rung I represent
 
00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 12 which is the town of marac
 
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
and I distributed earlier um a text of
 
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 align:start position:0%
my remark so I'm not going to read it
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
but I do want to point out um the
 
00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 align:start position:0%
impetus for this bill and it's I think
 
00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
it's the third one that's been
 
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.150 align:start position:0%
it's the third one that's been
introduced

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 align:start position:0%
um in the house to set up an ALS
 
00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
registry um this bill um there's really
 
00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 align:start position:0%
three drivers for this bill even though
 
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
I did say there's only two but I I added
 
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
one last night uh one is first of all
 
00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
even though ALS is um a very uncommon
 
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
disease it is estimated that growth is
 
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
going to be 36% by 2040 in the US and
 
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
70% globally it's one of the most
 
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
expensive chronic diseases someone could
 
00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
have um totally devastates quality of
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
life not only for the person suffering
 
00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
from it but also their family and so to
 
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
really understand the impact of this um
 
00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
and how it it may transpire in New
 
00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the future which would it's
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
also would take a lot of resources would
 
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
be just to count the cases we need to
 
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
know where we stand presently there's no
 
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.150 align:start position:0%
know where we stand presently there's no
um

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
activity on the part of the state to
 
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
collect that information we have no clue
 
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
how many ALS cases there are although in
 
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
the um the bill that was U passed I mean
 
00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:13.479 align:start position:0%
that that was introduced last year it
 
00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 align:start position:0%
was um they it did uh estimate 26 cases
 
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
per year and that's aligned with the
 
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.790 align:start position:0%
per year and that's aligned with the
national

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
national
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
average but my interest in this really
 
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
stems from the um cyanobacteria blooms
 
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
that we've been suffering in New
 
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um they've really ramped up
 
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
the last several years and research um
 
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
from around the globe is showing that
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
exposure to certain toxic cyanobacteria
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
blooms leads is a contributor to ALS um
 
00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:48.039 align:start position:0%
I can go into the science of that but I
 
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
won't bore you all with it but there are
 
00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:54.919 align:start position:0%
situations in areas um where
 
00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria a cyanobacteria toxin
 
00:07:59.550 --> 00:07:59.560 align:start position:0%
called bmaa
 
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
um when that's prevalent there's also a
 
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
jump in ALS cases it was first
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
discovered in um the Pacific after World
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
War II when um this cyan bacteria was
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
found in a lot of the natural vegetation
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
that was consumed as food and then later
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
it was discovered around in Enfield New
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire around Moma Lake that had been
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
impaired by cyanobacteria blooms a
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
cluster of ALS was found there and then
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago there was a cluster
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
found on the Eastern Shore of Lake
 
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
Champlain which has also been suffering
 
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
chronic cyanobacteria blooms so my
 
00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is really for New
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to start collecting data on
 
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
where we are now and to be able to
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
assess where we might be in the future
 
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
and how we should respond to that from
 
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
um a public health point of view and
 
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
also from an environmental point of view
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
it gives us more urgency to address
 
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms if we notice that
 
00:08:58.069 --> 00:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
there is this public health issue with
 
00:08:58.079 --> 00:09:00.110 align:start position:0%
there is this public health issue with
ALS

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
ALS
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
um so I I looked at um our neighboring
 
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
states which have Registries Maine
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
Vermont and
 
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and one of the things that
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
really glared out to me was and I and I
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
talked to the people that administer
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
those Registries is how much lower their
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
cost is for setting that up and
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
administering it compared to what is in
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that DHHS
 
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
supplied um in in the fiscal note you'll
 
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
see that they've identified
 
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
$861,000 in the first year to count an
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
estimated 26 cases which is 33,000 over
 
00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
$33,000 per case um I don't know about
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
you but that just seems a little bit of
 
00:09:48.069 --> 00:09:48.079 align:start position:0%
overreach um they also mentioned in
 
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
their fiscal note that they quote expect
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
ALS diagnoses to be significantly
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
greater in number than those for the
 
00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:57.399 align:start position:0%
other critical health problems listed in
 
00:09:57.399 --> 00:09:59.470 align:start position:0%
other critical health problems listed in
statute

00:09:59.470 --> 00:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
um f HB 576 am men's current statue that
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
only lists race syndrome and lead
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
poisoning as um critical health problems
 
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
Ray syndrome is has become extremely
 
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:17.240 align:start position:0%
rare when there was a jump in cases it
 
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
was due to um parents administering
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
aspirin to young children who had a
 
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
fever viral infection and with public
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
education about the hazards of that Ray
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
syndrome is very very very rare but lead
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
poisoning cases um this impacted more
 
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:39.519 align:start position:0%
than 1100 young New Hampshire children
 
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
just in
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
2023 so to think that ALS diagnosis are
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
going to be significantly greater than
 
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
lead poisoning cases just isn't true and
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's using the state's own information
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
and I incl I included the link in the um
 
00:10:57.389 --> 00:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
in my handout I'll also email this to
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
you so you'll have the live link so um I
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
I ask that um you you pass this bill I I
 
00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:10.839 align:start position:0%
would also ask that you question DHHS on
 
00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
alternatives to the increased Staffing
 
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
that they're requesting in order to
 
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
administer this this program um I also
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
included um the information from the
 
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
other states um Vermont when they passed
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
it in
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
2023 at the very most they estimated
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
$75,000 to 100,000 to set up and
 
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
implemented in the first year
 
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which has a far more
 
00:11:38.629 --> 00:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
extensive registry where they contract
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
with neurologists to double check
 
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
diagnosis it's very intensive they spend
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
less than
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
$23,000 per year to manage its registry
 
00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
so I'm not confident that the fiscal
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
note is an accurate representation of
 
00:11:55.389 --> 00:11:55.399 align:start position:0%
what is needed to implement the addition
 
00:11:57.629 --> 00:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
of ALS to the statute that which
 
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
currently counts race syndrome and lead
 
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
poisoning um and I do believe it's
 
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:05.240 align:start position:0%
important that we start collecting this
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
information because if the current
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
research continues to support the link
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
between ALS and cyanobacteria blooms
 
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to have some type of
 
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
a preparation on the part of the state
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
to address that so with that I'd be
 
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions okay thank
 
00:12:29.629 --> 00:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and I I'm remembering that the
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
last time we saw this there was a um
 
00:12:39.629 --> 00:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
suggestion that the registry created by
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation might be housed uh at
 
00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth medical rather than in the
 
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
and that that would get around the cost
 
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
issue um are you pursuing that or are
 
00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
you considering having it simply be in
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:13:03.189 --> 00:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
itself um thank you very much for the
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
question representative Weber um I'm
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
suggesting that this be incorporated
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Health and
 
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:13.240 align:start position:0%
Human Services we already track over I
 
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
think two dozen C types of cancer we
 
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
track lead poisoning we have the ability
 
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
to collect data and actually I'm not
 
00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
even um passionate about a full registry
 
00:13:29.189 --> 00:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
I just want to get a count if we can
 
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
just count the ALS cases without any
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
type of information that would be
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
subject to Hippa um I think it's
 
00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
important to get that Baseline I had a
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
conversation last year when after the um
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
this committee um I think they had
 
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
tabled the bill waiting to hear from
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth and then they eventually um
 
00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:51.759 align:start position:0%
recommended it be inexpedient to
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
legislate at a conversation with Dr
 
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
Elijah STL who is one of the leading
 
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
researchers looking at um a variety of
 
00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
neurological diseases and their
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
environmental triggers and he is a he
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
has a a neurology practice but he also
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
teaches at the geel school of medicine
 
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth and he said Dartmouth would
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
not take this on um so it really should
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
be up to the other states uh it should
 
00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:20.839 align:start position:0%
be up to the state just as our
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
neighboring states administer
 
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'm concerned uh that we're
 
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
getting these this type of
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
legislation uh when it it appears that
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
Services is supposed to do this if they
 
00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
see that it's uh
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
needed uh so that uh I'm wondering if
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee couldn't ask
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
them why this is is not uh being done uh
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't seem to to me that we we
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
should be telling professional groups
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
how to practice their in this instance
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
medicine uh do you have any comments
 
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
about how this this happens
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
frequently and any thoughts about it
 
00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
question other states our neighboring
 
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
states have done it through legislation
 
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
um it hasn't just been left up to the
 
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
department to make the decision to begin
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
the registry because it does come at a
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
it it it comes at a a cost of time and
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
money to to do the administration some
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
software changes so I I do think it
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
should be a legislative decision to do
 
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
that um I think understanding the growth
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
in ALS diagnosis and it's linked to
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
environmental factors um it should be on
 
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
the state's radar um and hopefully
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
through these bills that come forward
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
even when they don't pass the increased
 
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
awareness and um the fact that we should
 
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
take a proactive approach to
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
anticipating what government needs might
 
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
be necessary should we see this growth
 
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
in ALS diagnosis it's it is one of the
 
00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
most expensive diseases it it costs well
 
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839 align:start position:0%
over a million dollars it's always fatal
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
um it puts a huge burden on families
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
because most of the the time they're the
 
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:31.959 align:start position:0%
ones providing the home health care
 
00:16:34.309 --> 00:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
after the patient loses their ability to
 
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
perform the tasks of daily living so it
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
it is something that is in the best
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
interest of the state to start tracking
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
this um so that we're well prepared to
 
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
address any needs that come up in the
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
future follow up
 
00:16:53.069 --> 00:16:53.079 align:start position:0%
followup my concern is why isn't the
 
00:16:56.189 --> 00:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
doing this representative McKay they are
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
going to be testifying next so maybe
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
good maybe they can help thank you that
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
answer I our representative mlan and
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:11.079 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
representative R for taking my question
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
um so as you mentioned the Registries in
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
the other states are are quite expensive
 
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
extensive and you know Massachusetts you
 
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
said they're actually getting you know
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
data in from the neurologists so are
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
these not adequate enough to establish a
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
linkage for example with cyan blooms so
 
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.200 align:start position:0%
if we only have 26 cases what kind of
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
additional information specific we're
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
looking for specific information to New
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what are we trying to get out
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the commission or or the the registry
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
sorry that we're not getting from all of
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
these surrounding
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
Registries well geography number one I
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
think and well thank you for the
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
question representative um geography
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
number one I mean we may find that 26
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
cases are all in Meredith or all in bow
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
or all in communities Littleton for
 
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
instance which has a very impaired Lake
 
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
in its Community I think that's from my
 
00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:17.559 align:start position:0%
perspective uh with CYO bacteria
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
research I think knowing the geography
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
of where those people reside or spend
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
most of their time is very important um
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
I also think that that geography could
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
give us information on where we need to
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
invest resources should we need to ramp
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
up our home health care
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
assistance uh careers in New Hampshire
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
and Staffing we may find that we may be
 
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
justified in setting up a program in The
 
00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region to train people to take on
 
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
these tasks that are going to be at a
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
greater need thank you for the
 
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
question representative Nal thank you Mr
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
question um I have two related questions
 
00:18:59.789 --> 00:18:59.799 align:start position:0%
is that okay sure is 2 a real number or
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
is that a statistical
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
number because interestingly the
 
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
statistics work out perfect if you look
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
nationally the rates per thousand
 
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
100,000 or whatever it it it is a
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
national rate so um it would really vary
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
I think depending on the community and
 
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
uh now in Vermont the first year they
 
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
had it it actually started in July and
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
from July to December they counted 27
 
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
cases um the the last year was its full
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
year and they counted I think about the
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
same 26 or
 
00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:39.559 align:start position:0%
27 um I think it it's important for New
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to collect that information
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
because we have a much more robust Lake
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
economy and we have many people that
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
live along within Lake communities and
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
also people that come up and spend part
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
of the year in a lake community so I
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
think our situation is a little bit
 
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
different because of our geography in
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
our economy than if you compare it to
 
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
neighboring states does that answer your
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
question yeah so um my second question
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
is a little bit related but I tried to I
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
found it interesting where you tried to
 
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
put this in statute um I looked up what
 
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
a critical health problem was I couldn't
 
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
find a definition for it anywhere and
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
I'm curious is there a play where's this
 
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
coming from to Define this as a critical
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
health problem interesting enough um I
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
got a call after the last bill died from
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
someone who was retired from the
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
department and he had suggested to put
 
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
it in this area of Statute since we
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
already do it and there was no fiscal
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
note for those other two diseases thank
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
Maser yes thank you thank you for taking
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
my question I'm just looking at the
 
00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:54.710 align:start position:0%
my question I'm just looking at the
expend

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
expend
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
expenditures um and so 8
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
61,000 and I'm looking at all of
 
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
the the jobs below that are listed down
 
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:10.360 align:start position:0%
below it
 
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm just I'm it seems like a lot of
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
money to to add one additional piece of
 
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
St statistics to what we keep track of
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
um like a quality assurance analyst so
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
that would be like a a
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
full-time job for the foreseeable future
 
00:21:33.789 --> 00:21:33.799 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes thank you
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
representative I'm reading the fiscal
 
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
note the same way you are um it does say
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
five days per week for 26 weeks um I I
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
think that's a good question to ask the
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
department about the justification for
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
all these positions when an estimated 26
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
cases are going to be diagnosed right a
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars for that almost a
 
00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
million is okay thank you
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
Weber um no thank you so much and thank
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
um so am I right to conclude from your
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
remarks that it's your opinion that
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
those numbers are grossly overinflated
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
for the number of for the amount of work
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
that you're
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
contemplating might happen and if you
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
would describe for us a little bit what
 
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
you think the infrastructure needs to be
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
in order to do what you have in mind
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
effectively thank you representative for
 
00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:42.039 align:start position:0%
the question I am surprised at this
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I'm not an expert in
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
Registries or collecting health
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
information but when I look at our
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
neighboring states which um by most
 
00:22:57.269 --> 00:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
counts we share a lot of the same
 
00:22:57.279 --> 00:22:59.510 align:start position:0%
counts we share a lot of the same
economic

00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
economic
 
00:23:03.789 --> 00:23:03.799 align:start position:0%
features um really similar labor market
 
00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:05.269 align:start position:0%
features um really similar labor market
environmental

00:23:05.269 --> 00:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
factors and they if we combined all of
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
their expenses for setting up and
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
conducting a registry all that combined
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
is less than what this fiscal no is so
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
it just raises a lot of questions in my
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
mind about what this is intended to do I
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
I would be very happy and I would kind
 
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
of say that researchers ALS researchers
 
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
and people looking into research with
 
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
the connection with cyano bacteria
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
toxins I think any information is
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
important information we have no idea in
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire how many ALS
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
patients there are um I hear a lot of
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
anotal information about people on a
 
00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
lake that have been diagnosed and so
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
forth but we need data and just counting
 
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
the number of if I would be happy if we
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
knew how many patients there were and
 
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
where they lived most of the year I
 
00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
would be happy I think we need to start
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere and if we find that that count
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
is jumping well beyond what would be
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
statistically predicted um for our
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
numbers I think that may then you may
 
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
see us back or maybe the department
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
decides to expand the registry to
 
00:24:29.549 --> 00:24:29.559 align:start position:0%
include more data but at this point I
 
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
think we need to get a good Baseline of
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
the number of cases we have in New
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think also that
 
00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
information would be very helpful to
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.149 --> 00:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
states thank you representative R um I
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
had a question you made references to
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
Lakes is that I I don't know a lot about
 
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
the disease I I I know it's also called
 
00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
lugar's disease that's when it was first
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
discovered and I know a little bit about
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
the devastating effects it can have uh
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
from you know just reading and so forth
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
what is the lake connection is it um is
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
there a specific connection there or uh
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much you may regret
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
me answering this question because I may
 
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
get into the weeds but stop me if I do
 
00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire has been suffering
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
from an increase in toxic cyanobacteria
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
blooms um and they hit primarily lakes
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
ponds and rivers
 
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
and these blooms there's the the water's
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
getting warmer there's a lot of
 
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
phosphorus nitrogen running off into
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
lakes and it's triggering these massive
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
Blooms of
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria that are the world's
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
oldest living organism they enabled our
 
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
atmosphere to be formed um but when they
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
bloom they and it I want to back up a
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
little bit they used to be referred to
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
as blue green algae so if you've heard
 
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
of that that's the same as cyanobacteria
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
but these cyanobacteria they release
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
cyanotoxins and they fall into two
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
groups one that affects neuroproteins
 
00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
and one that affects the liver and
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
there's been compelling research over
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
the past know over 10 well over 10 years
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
that one of the components of
 
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria which is called bmaa it's
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
beta methyl Amino alanine that when that
 
00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:28.789 align:start position:0%
beta methyl Amino alanine that when that
is

00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
ingested or inhaled by people that are
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
near a bloom you don't even have to be
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
in the water you can be out of the water
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
the body mistakes that for an amino acid
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
called el seering which the body uses to
 
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.950 align:start position:0%
called el seering which the body uses to
synthesize

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
synthesize
 
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
neuroproteins so instead of the El serin
 
00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
going into the neuroprotein the bmaa
 
00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
gets added and the activity or the
 
00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
usefulness of proteins really is derived
 
00:27:01.389 --> 00:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
from their three-dimensional geometry or
 
00:27:04.029 --> 00:27:04.039 align:start position:0%
how they fold on themselves and when
 
00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
neuroproteins that have mistakenly had
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
bmaa incorporated into them they misfold
 
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
and so they don't have the activity or
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
um they can't express their their their
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
biochemical purpose um as if they were
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
normally synthesized with
 
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
lerene scientists believe that this bmaa
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
getting incorporated into neuroproteins
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
misfolding the misfunction that causes
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
in the neurological system is Manifest
 
00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:42.039 align:start position:0%
itself with ALS it's there is also newer
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
research showing that it may also
 
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
contribute to Parkinson's and
 
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's but that that research is is
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
still pretty
 
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
questions representative tez
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman um and thank
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
you for uh explaining this to us I um
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
it's interesting I I'm looking up uh you
 
00:28:11.549 --> 00:28:11.559 align:start position:0%
know when you said I would be happy with
 
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039 align:start position:0%
just knowing the counts that raises
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
other opportunities like you know asking
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
insur like administrative data sets and
 
00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:23.559 align:start position:0%
how many how many cases through
 
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
administrative you know which is through
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
insurers you know there there's other
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
ways we could try to just get
 
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
account um and that's different you know
 
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
then then there's surveillance which is
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
the public health system you know
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
monitoring and tracking and then there's
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
registry so so we we've we want to be
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
careful we're not
 
00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:45.519 align:start position:0%
conflating um the different concepts
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um and I just looked
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
up there is a US registry but the
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
problem is when you look to see their
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
data it's from
 
00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
2018 right it's there's a huge lag so I
 
00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
can understand you're clearly in New
 
00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:01.519 align:start position:0%
England there are more concerns I'm not
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
a question I'm sorry
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
um L my train of thought um uh well
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
would you would you be happy with just
 
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
would would it be sufficient to just
 
00:29:13.159 --> 00:29:14.590 align:start position:0%
would would it be sufficient to just
track

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
track
 
00:29:19.149 --> 00:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
numbers uh like counts or is it really
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to know and manage
 
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.110 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to know and manage
the

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:24.799 align:start position:0%
population thank you very much
 
00:29:27.509 --> 00:29:27.519 align:start position:0%
representative for the question um
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
there's I I'm I'm hearing two different
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
things so correct me if I'm wrong but
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
one there is a National Registry but
 
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
it's voluntary so for real research
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
purposes it's not very useful because it
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
has that bias people that want to enter
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
their information enter it but we miss a
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
lot of cases because people may opt out
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
of that um as far
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
as what what type of surveillance or
 
00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
collection of information we use
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
obviously I'd like to get information
 
00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
that you know length of residency where
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
did you live maybe a occupation what
 
00:30:08.909 --> 00:30:08.919 align:start position:0%
things might have you been exposed to so
 
00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:11.519 align:start position:0%
that we can gather enough data to see if
 
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
there is something um environmental or
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
information that might help us address
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
any growth in ALS cases but at the very
 
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
minimum um for the purposes of just
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
knowing if there is a need we're going
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
to have to address in the
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
future just getting the number of cases
 
00:30:33.389 --> 00:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
and where these people reside would be a
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
I think a good first
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
step thank you representative n thank
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
question um I'm so impressed with your
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
description earlier that I'm a little
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
wild but I have a I have another
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
question um the importance of any
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
legislation is enforceability and um it
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
require this legislation I believe
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
requires that within 10 days you you if
 
00:30:59.629 --> 00:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
I make a diagnosis that I have to submit
 
00:30:59.639 --> 00:31:00.430 align:start position:0%
I make a diagnosis that I have to submit
that

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:03.389 --> 00:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
diagnosis um I'm curious what happens if
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
I don't do that and secondly um we
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
learned last time that a lot of the ALS
 
00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:10.519 align:start position:0%
patients actually get their care in
 
00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts not New Hampshire does
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
this apply to the docks in Massachusetts
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
that they're going to have to report
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
that to New
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you very much
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative that's a good
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
question I would have to go back I know
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
Vermont and in Maine and perhaps
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um does address that issue
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
because there are a lot of verter who
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
come into Dartmouth they have an I think
 
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
they have an ALS clinic or well that Dr
 
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
stl's there he's like um so I think they
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
account for that but I'm not exactly
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
sure how that that administration of
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
people that go across state borders from
 
00:31:56.909 --> 00:31:56.919 align:start position:0%
their state of residence how they get
 
00:31:59.950 --> 00:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
that how that would be um accounted for
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
in New
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I know other states have
 
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
done it so I think we could learn from
 
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
that and I'm also open I'm open to
 
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment like I said the very minimum
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
I'm really looking for is that we start
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
counting these cases and where the these
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
people spend most of their
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Whitney
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
Hammond from the Department of Health
 
00:32:52.509 --> 00:32:52.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.509 --> 00:32:54.519 align:start position:0%
Services and you've asked for five
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
minutes if you could keep a little
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
shorter that would be great maybe well
 
00:32:58.750 --> 00:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
there two of you
 
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
so yes so yeah there's two of you so
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine I I can keep it brief
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
um representative rung did such an
 
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
excellent job communicating a lot of
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
what is in my written testimony so
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
instead of reading you know what I have
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
in there I'll just hit the key points
 
00:33:19.149 --> 00:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
and then leave time for questions um so
 
00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
I just first I'll introduce myself I'm
 
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
Whitney Hammond I'm the interm deputy
 
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
director for the division of Public
 
00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
Health and I'm joined do you want to
 
00:33:29.789 --> 00:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for the recer sorry my name is
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
Jaa Chala I'm the bureau chief of Public
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
Health statistic informatic in the
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health thank
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
you um so thank you for the opportunity
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
to testify today um the the the this
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
bill proposes an amendment to RSA 141 A2
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
to add ALS as a critical health problem
 
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
um that would require entities to as was
 
00:33:59.070 --> 00:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
pointed out report ALS diagnosis within
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
10 days of a
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
diagnosis um the addition of ALS to that
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
statute would require us to update our
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
administrative rule so
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
hp32 which has uh
 
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
expired um the lapse occurred because of
 
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
um what representative of rung had
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
described which is that it related to
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
raise syndrome which is no long we see
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
about one to two cases of raise syndrome
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
per year as a country
 
00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
um and then lead poisoning is covered
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
under a different statute um and so this
 
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
administrative rule hasn't been updated
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
largely due to the fact that lead
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
poisoning is covered in other
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
statute um the amount of time it would
 
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
take for the Department to update those
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
administrative rules would likely be
 
00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
around 6 to 8 months as opposed to the
 
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
60 days that's in the proposed
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
legislation um the other noteworthy
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
thing uh and it is in my testimony but
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
regarding some of the questions that
 
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
came up uh during representative Run's
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
testimony we don't currently have so if
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with the critical health
 
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
problem um statute it was
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
developed I think back in the 70s um so
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
there is no actual infrastructure in
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
place to facilitate the reporting of
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
those critical health problems um so
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
there there's no data system there's no
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
existing staff um in terms of raise
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
syndrome so the department would
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
actually need to develop uh an
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
information system that's hippoc
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
compliant and that is you know going to
 
00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
keep all of that data safe and secure um
 
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
so that ties into some of that fiscal
 
00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
note worksheet in terms of the if you
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
see the cost by year it's it's a big
 
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
cost in the first year and then it drops
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
down to Staffing costs in the subsequent
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
years so it is really important to have
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
that context of this isn't adding in a a
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
critical health problem to an existing
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
data infrastructure um we would have to
 
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.750 align:start position:0%
data infrastructure um we would have to
develop

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
develop
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
that um and then the other
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
noteworthy thing I I think actually that
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
is the the most important thing so time
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
frame for updating administrative rules
 
00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
would not work within 60 days and there
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
would be a big upfront cost for
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
developing an ual
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
system happy to take any
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
questions great um and um ma'am could
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
you give us spell your name for us
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
please uh Jala c h i a h UI last name c
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
h h UI yeah last name c h a w l a c h a
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
w l a yeah thank you okay
 
00:37:01.309 --> 00:37:01.319 align:start position:0%

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
that i a h yeah okay great thank you
 
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.270 align:start position:0%
that i a h yeah okay great thank you
very

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:37:08.829 --> 00:37:08.839 align:start position:0%
much uh uh representative woods and then
 
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you Mr chair
 
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit confused you identified
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
that there is no system
 
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
present um does that mean you're not
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
tracking lead as well so there is a lead
 
00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:29.240 align:start position:0%
system specific there is a system yeah
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
there is a data system for lead that's
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
covered under a different RSA which I
 
00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
referenced in my written testimony um
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
but that would be very specific to
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
capturing lead data and not ALS data um
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
and predominantly the reporters for lead
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
poisoning are Labs as opposed to
 
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
neurologists follow followup
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
um I know I'm very naive perhaps but it
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
seems like that
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
system uh in place for lead would be
 
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
would interface very easily again my
 
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
naive perspective uh to handle uh
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
data I can take that question thank you
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
for that question so currently for lab
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
poisoning and lab testing we do have
 
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
other mechanism and under other
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
administrative rules to identify what
 
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
data element to um collect and and the
 
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
frequency and who should report so that
 
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
is covered under um the healthy home or
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
lab poisoning programs uh administrative
 
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
rules so for that system we will need to
 
00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
do more uh investigation and and
 
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
identify whether that system will be
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
able to be expand to include um other
 
00:38:52.589 --> 00:38:52.599 align:start position:0%
critical uh health problems like AOS
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
into that system but typically the
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
reporting stream is from um different
 
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
um healthare providers uh primary would
 
00:39:05.069 --> 00:39:05.079 align:start position:0%
be like a pediatrician or um lab system
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
to report the that poisoning testing
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
result to that system uh so that is what
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
I understand the other part is the data
 
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
elements are different So currently um
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
the lad poisoning is follow is following
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire implementation Guide
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
local implementation guide to uh submit
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
the lab poisoning testing result data uh
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
the data element may not be um similar
 
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
with what the health uh Records or or um
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
health conditions will need to provide
 
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
it so so we will need to do further
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
investigation and and talk with the
 
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
program areas and also our it folks
 
00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
whether that channel is feasible or not
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
but basically those are two different
 
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:49.640 align:start position:0%
Reporting System uh per different
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
requirements thank you representative
 
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
Weber and then representative McKay
 
00:39:59.550 --> 00:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman well having
 
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
answered representative Wood's question
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
you answered my first question but
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
brought up another question which is um
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
with respect to rul making I understand
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
that if we were to keep the bill as it
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
is it's in a section that already
 
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
requires rul making from the Department
 
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
with respect to any disease that's added
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
section could we not not put this in a
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
freestanding section somewhere else and
 
00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.390 align:start position:0%
freestanding section somewhere else and
simply

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
simply
 
00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.630 align:start position:0%
simply
require

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
that Physicians report to the
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
department the minimum amount of
 
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
information which is the the presence of
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
the disease and where the person
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
lives uh which certainly in my mind
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
would not require rule making at all it
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
would simply require a secure location
 
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
to put the data but that's not a huge
 
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.470 align:start position:0%
to put the data but that's not a huge
amount

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
of that's not a huge amount of
 
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping what would be the barrier
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
to doing that at a very minimum level at
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
a very minimum cost so we could figure
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
out whether such information as as basic
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
as GE we've estimated ated
 
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
26 um cases per year based on National
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
Data but Vermont which has a population
 
00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
less than half of ours already has about
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
that many so we don't even know where we
 
00:41:43.309 --> 00:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
fall in that Spectrum what would be the
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
barrier to doing that very very minimal
 
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
amount of data
 
00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:50.839 align:start position:0%
collection so I want to make sure I'm
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
understanding so are you saying instead
 
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
of what's in the proposed bill which
 
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
would make um ALS a critical health
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
problem just add another um like ALS not
 
00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
CR okay um I would think and I would ask
 
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:09.640 align:start position:0%
jawe for her um input because she works
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
in this more than I do I think that
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
would require administrative rules for
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
the Department to you know once if um
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
could you speak the current uh statute
 
00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
does say that rule making on the
 
00:42:23.309 --> 00:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and the current
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
statute also um identified that the
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
department would need to identify the
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
data element on the collection which
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
include the social security number
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
currently is listed as one of data
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
element and uh for the Department um is
 
00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:40.359 align:start position:0%
a kppa cover entity so we will need to
 
00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
fall under the Hippa uh compliance to
 
00:42:46.109 --> 00:42:46.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that the system Safeguard all
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
the Phi pii as well so for that sense um
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
that's why in our physical node we
 
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
consulted with our it folks to utilize
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
the current state infrastructure which
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
we have which is a Salesforce
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and because we do not
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
have this administrative rule so we are
 
00:43:06.549 --> 00:43:06.559 align:start position:0%
not sure what the minimum business
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
requirements are for example what type
 
00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
of data elements we will need to collect
 
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
what is the validation process would be
 
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
needed in order to collect the uh
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
validate and useful data set we do not
 
00:43:22.109 --> 00:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
want to have anyone to open we do not
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
want to open a form to have anyone to
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
report we want to make sure this is
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
reported by the provider who does the
 
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
diagnosis to a specific patient and also
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
um uh without the administrative rule or
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
without the business requirement it
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
would be a little bit difficult for a it
 
00:43:44.349 --> 00:43:44.359 align:start position:0%
system to be established uh and also um
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
to look for a meaningful way to validate
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
and also to um uh quality control the
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
data entry and as well as the follow-up
 
00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
reporting so that's why in our um fiscal
 
00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
note we put estimate we do not want to
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
underestimate the system because if the
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
requirement is a little bit complicated
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh not only to have the providers to um
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
report the cases but also to verify the
 
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
provider's identity which might lead us
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
to um work with oplc office or
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
professional license um sorry I forgot
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
what is stand for uh that that type to
 
00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
verify the uh provider's status and
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
identify who will need to report rep and
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
if someone does not report we may need
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
to follow up but what we base on to
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
follow up with a provider that's
 
00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
something that we also need to have a
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
good um requirement uh in beforehand
 
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
when we establish a system so that's why
 
00:44:45.069 --> 00:44:45.079 align:start position:0%
and administrative rules will really
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
help uh IR out the basic requirement
 
00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you very much and I
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
understand the complexity as it relates
 
00:44:56.349 --> 00:44:56.359 align:start position:0%
to the bill is drafted what I'm really
 
00:44:56.359 --> 00:44:57.790 align:start position:0%
to the bill is drafted what I'm really
asking

00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
asking
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
and this is because I'm not a health
 
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
care professional but I have done a
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
great deal of Investigation of a lot of
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
different things in the course of my
 
00:45:09.549 --> 00:45:09.559 align:start position:0%
lifetime and it seems to me and I also
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
do know because I am a lawyer that we
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
often have statutes that are not
 
00:45:16.349 --> 00:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
accompanied by administrative rules
 
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
because the statute tells you exactly
 
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
who is going to do what and so it seems
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
to me that it could be possible to draft
 
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
a statute
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
to minimize the burden on the
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
department could we not simply have a
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
statute that says a provider who
 
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
diagnoses this
 
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
disease shall report it to the
 
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
department and the department will keep
 
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.030 align:start position:0%
department and the department will keep
records

00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
of the the the patient the location the
 
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
patient lives in and um we'll keep
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
records on the number of cases so we're
 
00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:04.839 align:start position:0%
not getting
 
00:46:09.309 --> 00:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
into huge privacy issues it then seems
 
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
to me that that's just a matter of
 
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
collecting the information that comes in
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't it be true that somebody
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
yes would be required to call and verify
 
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps that this was a licensed
 
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
provider but that that's a very minimal
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
amount of effort on the part of the
 
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
department and I'm not understanding
 
00:46:33.309 --> 00:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
what I'm missing here so I'm hoping you
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
will explain that to
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
me um yes I I agree that if we have
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
everything ly out on the administrative
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me the statute excuse me uh
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
including the data elements that we will
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
need to collect then that that would
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
help us on the it side um to be able to
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
identify the business need and then
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
identify the C for the infrastructure
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
building and development that is fible
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
but uh um I'll defer it to when if from
 
00:47:09.549 --> 00:47:09.559 align:start position:0%
the Department perspective or from the
 
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
um legislative pers yeah I would I would
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
agree with what um she said
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to think through the the
 
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
question around
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
Hippa um and just
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
I I think in order to be able to do some
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
of the like quality assurance and
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
verification and I I'm not expert in
 
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
Hippa but I I think it would be
 
00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
challenging to have high quality data
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
that is not going to also need to be
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
Hippa compliant if that makes sense like
 
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
I I don't think um it would be as simple
 
00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
as like somebody saying hey I've got one
 
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
put it on you know put a check for what
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
I think we would want a little more
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
detail to be able to make sure it's not
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
the same one that we got a report on
 
00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
from another
 
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
provider um
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
and so yeah thank you thank you that Mak
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
sense representative McKay did you have
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
your hand up a moment ago and then
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
representative L mantin thank you Mr
 
00:48:16.829 --> 00:48:16.839 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I have uh no concern about
 
00:48:16.839 --> 00:48:17.950 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I have uh no concern about
this

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
legislation uh what my
 
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
suggestion is that this could have been
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
handled uh by the oversight committee
 
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
the legislative oversight committee that
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
was established for these purposes there
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
are a couple of people in this room
 
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
right now I think that serve on that
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
committee is it your opinion that the
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
oversight committee which meets
 
00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
frequently probably monthly monthly uh
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh and the chairman is one of those
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
people uh it's a very effective group
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
my point is that it it need not have
 
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
come to us at all it could have been uh
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
worked on by the existing system that is
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
here do you have any thoughts about
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
that so my read of the current statute
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
around the critical health problems is
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
there there are so there's the lead
 
00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
poisoning requirement the race syndrome
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
and then there's a third um broader
 
00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:27.079 align:start position:0%
category for critical health problems
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
that are identified by the department so
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
I think in in that regard ALS could be
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
um identified as a critical health
 
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
problem under existing statute I I do
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
think you know and based on the fiscal
 
00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559 align:start position:0%
note worksheet there would have to be
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
resources allocated to support the
 
00:49:47.789 --> 00:49:47.799 align:start position:0%
department and being able to
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
operationalize that so in statute yes
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
but it does need resources allocated
 
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
my major point is
 
00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
efficiency and the legislature formed a
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
committee to do the things that we're
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
doing right now uh and I'm kind of
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
putting you on the spot by saying if it
 
00:50:17.309 --> 00:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
couldn't this have been all worked out
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm not familiar enough with how the
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
oversight committee would come like how
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
this would actually be brought to them
 
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
legislation representative lamon and
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
then representative mlan thank you Mr
 
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for um taking my
 
00:50:54.069 --> 00:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
question um but it seems to me that the
 
00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
difference between a registry which
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
which records um name and data um would
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
be different than just keeping a list
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
because first it'll allow perhaps the
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
CDC to cross check that we're not
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
recording the same patient that in New
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that goes to Dartmouth or in
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um that would it would
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
give you a better account um but it
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
would be also true that with that
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
registry um the CDC or perhaps other
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
researchers may be able to contact and
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
request permission from the patient to
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
participate in more long-term studies or
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
looking back because maybe it is cyano
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
bacteria but maybe it was an exposure
 
00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:47.240 align:start position:0%
that occurred 20 years before they could
 
00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:49.839 align:start position:0%
could collect all that data of where
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
people lived in the past and and maybe
 
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
find clusters because ALS you know
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
unlike lead
 
00:52:00.789 --> 00:52:00.799 align:start position:0%
poisoning um which has a known cause we
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
don't know what causes it and there's no
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
cure and only by really being able to
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
get into long-term studies and knowing
 
00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
all the patients who they are and where
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
they lived would be able to make
 
00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
progress in that area is that right yeah
 
00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you for making that distinction
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
around a registry and collecting case
 
00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
counts um and I do think that is a
 
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
fundamental question of what is it that
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to do related to ALS
 
00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
that should then guide what is the
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
solution that we need in New Hampshire
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to achieve that and even just
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
hearing some of the description around
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
you know well it would be good to have
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
residential history and know how often
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
people are you know in places on lakes
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that starts to get into
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
a much bigger sort of system that's more
 
00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:54.200 align:start position:0%
registry esque than counting cases and I
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
think you make a nice uh point about how
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
public health uses the data also in
 
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
impacts the way that we design the data
 
00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
collection so for something like lead
 
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
poisoning it is enough to just have you
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
know that that data and be able to
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
actually provide case management for a
 
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
child who has elevated blood Le levels
 
00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
but it's not necessarily you know useful
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
for connecting them with
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
research representative
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
McLean thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I'm not in house
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
finance but obviously the sticker shock
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
on this bill is is pretty big but that
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
being said it sounds like this is the
 
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:37.720 align:start position:0%
first critical health problem that we're
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
looking at as to representative Wood's
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
comments so do we see a horizon where
 
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to be wanting to look at
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
other critical health problems is is
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
there other things that the the
 
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
department is looking at and with that
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
being said you know if we do this work
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
now and develop this registry having
 
00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
established that framework is as we add
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
on these new critical health problems is
 
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
it a zero costing or um you know because
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
or is it is it going to be $800,000
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
every time okay it's a really
 
00:54:20.829 --> 00:54:20.839 align:start position:0%
interesting question and I will ask for
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
JA way to weigh in but I would say just
 
00:54:25.789 --> 00:54:25.799 align:start position:0%
from my work in chronic disease more
 
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
broadly and The Division I would I would
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely anticipate additional
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
interest in adding other critical health
 
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
problems when and if the infrastructure
 
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
was in place around ALS so we frequently
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
receive questions about other kinds of
 
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
chronic conditions that I could imagine
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
people having interest in but the follow
 
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
on cost would be that's where I would
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
ask for ja's input that that will
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
actually depends because each disease
 
00:54:58.829 --> 00:54:58.839 align:start position:0%
has different um Specialties or uh staff
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
you know specialty to to be able to do
 
00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
the followup working a registry um so
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
that that will really depends on which
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
disease that we are we are tracking and
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
for the record we are we do um receive
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
the the lab poisoning um test result
 
00:55:17.309 --> 00:55:17.319 align:start position:0%
under this statute uh but under the
 
00:55:20.349 --> 00:55:20.359 align:start position:0%
other administrative rules so alsos will
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
not be the first critical conditions
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
under the statutes that we are currently
 
00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
we will be receiving so left poisoning
 
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
is part of part of then that we the
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
department is working on now so um
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
theoretically yes but it depends on the
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
business need and if there are any other
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
um type of informations that the
 
00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
registry of specific uh disease is
 
00:55:47.549 --> 00:55:47.559 align:start position:0%
looking for that then that may or may
 
00:55:51.549 --> 00:55:51.559 align:start position:0%
not that may add some additional CA um
 
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
the current infrastructure uh or create
 
00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
different module because
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
we may want to have some kind like a
 
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:01.720 align:start position:0%
user access restriction even though it's
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
one registry or even though this is a
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
registry but this is for ALS registry
 
00:56:09.069 --> 00:56:09.079 align:start position:0%
certain users may not be able to see the
 
00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
information from other registry or from
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
other disease so they will have a more
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
further discussion on uh not only um to
 
00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:19.000 align:start position:0%
create module for another disease but
 
00:56:21.789 --> 00:56:21.799 align:start position:0%
also how we do uh good in the data
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
governance and data management for the
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
user access and Reporting access Channel
 
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
Etc so at this moment um it may have
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
additional cost yes follow up and thank
 
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
you for that but just as a followup
 
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
though would this system though once
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's established be the basic framework
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
in so you're not going to be creating
 
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
separate Frameworks this is everything
 
00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
is going to be added onto this we're not
 
00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
going to be creating SE separate ones in
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
the future just adding in and modifying
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
it slightly to adapt for different kinds
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
of problems
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank thank you for the follow-up
 
00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:01.240 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
theoretically yes but uh uh we will
 
00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
still need to see what type of disease
 
00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
will be added and if there's any
 
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
additional um requirement that would be
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
needed uh then then that could have
 
00:57:17.549 --> 00:57:17.559 align:start position:0%
additional cost at this moment we are
 
00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
not able to uh provide a certain
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
statement that it yes or no on the cost
 
00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:27.559 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you I'm repres ative n thank
 
00:57:29.309 --> 00:57:29.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thanks for taking my
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
question um I brought this question up
 
00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
earlier but interestingly I'm on the
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
rare disease commission Believe It or
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
Not ALS is considered part of that does
 
00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
a condition that affects 26 people or
 
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
diagnoses per year 66 total in the state
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
um does the department consider that a
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
health care um crisis or whatever are
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
whatever term I'm sorry the critical
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
health problem critical health problem
 
00:57:59.390 --> 00:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
um I had opened the definition from
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
statute of a critical health problem a
 
00:58:04.349 --> 00:58:04.359 align:start position:0%
disease condition or procedure relating
 
00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
to Public Health which is determined by
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
the commissioner to be of particular
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
concern or importance as a critical
 
00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
health problem in this state being in
 
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
need of Greater research study and
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
statistical analysis that seemed very
 
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
open-ended to me and I looked for more
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
of a national um definition and I
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't find one so I'm just curious
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
would you guys consider that to be a
 
00:58:28.349 --> 00:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
critical health problem if it affects
 
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
people I don't
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
different um and I don't think there's
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
more clarity in the administrative rules
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
around this so I I would say I don't
 
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
know how to define a critical health
 
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
problem without more
 
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
definition okay thank you representative
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
taes thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
taking my questions um
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh I I I really appreciated some of the
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
prior questions and I feel like
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
representative Weber laid out like
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
what's the right process but also we
 
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:11.720 align:start position:0%
explored is there another data system to
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
build on and so part of what I think I'm
 
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
not completely clear on is are there
 
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
other reportable conditions are there
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
other like are there other systems that
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
exist already because I think that was
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
the point of the question is is there
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
anything else we could build on because
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
we don't know right like maybe there's
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
10 other potential systems we could be
 
00:59:32.109 --> 00:59:32.119 align:start position:0%
building on we just picked the one that
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
has lead or or whatever so I think that
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
would be a a helpful thing to understand
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
um so yes there are many other systems
 
00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
for reporting all kinds of different um
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
data to the department like for example
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
the cancer registry or we have our
 
00:59:52.029 --> 00:59:52.039 align:start position:0%
communicable disease reporting which is
 
00:59:53.950 --> 00:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
a very different approach for how we
 
00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
gather data so I think in answer to your
 
01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
question it could be worthwhile to look
 
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
at what we have in place and how we
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
could build on something that's already
 
01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
existing I would add though the you know
 
01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:09.640 align:start position:0%
the point around that may have a cost
 
01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
associated with it to to sort of
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
retrofit an existing system but we'd
 
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
have to look into that follow up follow
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
up yeah so thank you I think you did a
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
lovely job of explaining like
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
potentially the huge costs in the first
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
six months although it sounds like maybe
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
it's lot less right depending on the
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
answer to all these other questions I am
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
more wondering about the need for one
 
01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:35.720 align:start position:0%
FTE every year thereafter for a
 
01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
condition that maybe you know you know
 
01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
is is a much
 
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
slower prevalence in incidents so can
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:50.200 align:start position:0%
please I don't so I think it would take
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
around one FTE to be look certainly in
 
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
the first year helping to get things up
 
01:00:57.630 --> 01:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
and running the fiscal note worksheet
 
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
included um costs related to contractors
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
who would work on development of the
 
01:01:04.349 --> 01:01:04.359 align:start position:0%
actual system and there would be the
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
need for somebody to be overseeing that
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
work and monitoring it and then moving
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
forward I think especially with
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
something this new there would be a need
 
01:01:18.029 --> 01:01:18.039 align:start position:0%
to have um probably one FTE to just even
 
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
be working with providers and promoting
 
01:01:23.549 --> 01:01:23.559 align:start position:0%
the the reporting into the system and uh
 
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
presumably there would actually be
 
01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:27.640 align:start position:0%
requests to use the data in the system
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
and so we would want somebody available
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
to be responding to that as well just
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
for context um the cancer registry has
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
about I think 10 full-time staff that
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
and clearly there are more cancer
 
01:01:46.029 --> 01:01:46.039 align:start position:0%
diagnoses than ALS but there's a lot of
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
support for providers and offices around
 
01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
giving us this data because it is um you
 
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:53.720 align:start position:0%
know something that's additional for
 
01:01:56.109 --> 01:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
them to do and particularly if you want
 
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
something like residential history
 
01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
that's not something they're typically
 
01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
collecting as part of their electronic
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
health record so that individual who's
 
01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:07.240 align:start position:0%
one FTE would also have to be doing work
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
with providers to help them capture the
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
data we
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
questions sorry uh may I oh sure sorry
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
follow up the questions um during the
 
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
questions we did hear that how the data
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
will be used um I just want to mention
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
that we the department do need to have a
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
legal Authority in order to release the
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
data that we collect currently this
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
statute does not give us any legal
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
Authority other than uh release the
 
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
aggregate annual report so if the intent
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
for this ALS data is for research we
 
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
will need to have legal Authority on how
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
we should release the confidential data
 
01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:55.160 align:start position:0%
and maybe have um a a privacy review
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
board uh to review all the uh
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
applications uh I just want to uh put
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
that uh in the front uh if if there's a
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
um expectation or if the statute will
 
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
require the department to release the
 
01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
data for the research for the health
 
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
related research purpose then we will
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
need to have the legal Authority in
 
01:03:15.549 --> 01:03:15.559 align:start position:0%
order to do
 
01:03:17.309 --> 01:03:17.319 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
you I see no other questions so thank
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Nancy Beerman
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
Deck you didn't indicate how much time
 
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
if we do about three minutes would be
 
01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
great I'll
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
try every committee I testify in front
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
just announces you only have this much
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
time um yes Nancy Beerman um I'm on the
 
01:03:57.789 --> 01:03:57.799 align:start position:0%
rare disease advisory Council for New
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um with representative Nagel
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
um and uh we uh also I'm here also to
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
introduce us in case you didn't know
 
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
about our Council um and also let you
 
01:04:11.549 --> 01:04:11.559 align:start position:0%
know that we are available to testify
 
01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
and give um information and give you
 
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
more um data on what's going on um Dr
 
01:04:26.109 --> 01:04:26.119 align:start position:0%
um where is Elijah STL is also on our
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
committee in fact it's was part of the
 
01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
uh beginning of the rare disease
 
01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
advisory Council that someone from the
 
01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
ALS with research was part of the
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
committee um just to let you know rare
 
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
diseases less than um one and 2,000
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
people are diagnosed with it and that's
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
what you need to be considered to be a
 
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
rare disease there's over 300 million
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
people in the world that have a rare
 
01:04:52.109 --> 01:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
disease that means 3.5 to 5.9% of the
 
01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
population have a rare disease 72% are
 
01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.309 align:start position:0%
population have a rare disease 72% are
genetic

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
genetic
 
01:04:59.309 --> 01:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
diseases 70% of them start in
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
childhood but it will take almost up to
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
10 years for most people to be diagnosed
 
01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
um my child has multiple rare diseases I
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
had had one it's now been not deemed
 
01:05:13.269 --> 01:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
rare um uh because of the number of
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
people that are recently being diagnosed
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
with it and more awareness of it uh my
 
01:05:21.789 --> 01:05:21.799 align:start position:0%
mother has one um that's different um
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
than what my child has and I may acquire
 
01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
it at some point um all pediatric
 
01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
cancers are rare um also to let you know
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
rare disease today day is February 28th
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
and we are going to be trying to be here
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
to bring
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
awareness um the uh rare disease
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
advisory Council was formed in 2019 here
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um this year I was
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
fortunate to be able to travel to
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
Washington DC for the National
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
Organization of rare diseases um and
 
01:05:56.269 --> 01:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
meet with other arxs um around the
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
United States not every state has one we
 
01:06:02.589 --> 01:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
are one of the beginning ones um and uh
 
01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
one of our we have an RSA 126 a79 and uh
 
01:06:09.069 --> 01:06:09.079 align:start position:0%
one of our mandates is to collect data
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
and explore data collected by the
 
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
Department of Human Services so
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
representative M Clean yes there are
 
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
many of us that would like to add more
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
rare diseases to a registry to find out
 
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
exactly what is going on um for my own
 
01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
child yes her genetic disease showed up
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
at BIR
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
um but it took until the age of 14 to
 
01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
get a diagnosis I knew there was
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
something up I knew something was wrong
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
I didn't know what it was I knew there
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
was stuff going on in my whole family I
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
mean I just thought it was normal that
 
01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:39.640 align:start position:0%
every family had all kinds of medical
 
01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
issues I later found out that isn't
 
01:06:45.309 --> 01:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
normal um you know when we finally got
 
01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
her diagnosis it's like oh you all have
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
it so I felt like I was Oprah you have
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
it and you have it and you have it to
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
all our family members at Christmas one
 
01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
year once we found out what it was um
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
but also getting um access to genetic
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
counselors and information is very
 
01:07:03.069 --> 01:07:03.079 align:start position:0%
difficult and having a rare disease it's
 
01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
hard to find doctors um we spend our
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
days and weeks in Massachusetts
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
traveling down there to get to experts
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
because they don't exist here in New
 
01:07:14.829 --> 01:07:14.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so um uh the rare disease
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
advisory Council would definitely
 
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
support this bill and trying to get a
 
01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:21.799 align:start position:0%
registry and also to add other um rare
 
01:07:24.109 --> 01:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
diseases to be tracked because a lot of
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
rare diseases are going off of the list
 
01:07:29.269 --> 01:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
of being rare and becoming more and more
 
01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
common thank you any questions any
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative nan oh hi thank
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
questions nice to see you again nice to
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
see you um You' said something really
 
01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:44.200 align:start position:0%
interesting several times that your rare
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
disease is no longer rare why do you
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
think that is um because of the uh
 
01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:54.200 align:start position:0%
leader uh of that's been doing all the
 
01:07:57.269 --> 01:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
research um he stated last year that
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's no longer considered rare with the
 
01:07:59.950 --> 01:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
number of people that are being
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with it so um statistically I
 
01:08:05.309 --> 01:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
don't have the numbers I'm not a math
 
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
person but just with the number that's
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
coming up and one of my other uh one of
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
my daughter's other rare diseases were I
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
know social media is not the best data
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
collection but um we have people on
 
01:08:20.829 --> 01:08:20.839 align:start position:0%
there from all over the world and when
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
we're getting two to three new people
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
joining and saying hey I just was
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with this that's
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
alarming and um and people are looking
 
01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
for help looking for answers how do I
 
01:08:34.030 --> 01:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
treat this how do I keep my two-year-old
 
01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
safe and um the disease I'm talking
 
01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
about is called uticaria and um we've
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
had a lot of new diagnosises and um and
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
it's alarming the number of children and
 
01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
little ones um that are being diagnosed
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
and it's dangerous um you can go into
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
anaphylaxis and you can die very quickly
 
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
from this because if you're not aware of
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
it and other people aren't aware aare of
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
it and doctors will just tell parents oh
 
01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
you don't need an upy pen it's no big
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
deal it is a big deal um if they're
 
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
exposed to cold and you don't even know
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
what's going to trigger it it can be the
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
air it can be the water it can be air
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
conditioning it can be a difference in
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
temperature my daughter's first
 
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
experience was at Lake Sunapee in the
 
01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
summer um that's not a cold time of the
 
01:09:21.789 --> 01:09:21.799 align:start position:0%
year um and uh you just don't ever know
 
01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
what's going to trigger it and when you
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
have Littles that don't tell what's
 
01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
going on and how they're feeling because
 
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
they don't know that it's different it's
 
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
very dangerous and we've had quite a few
 
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
parents like oh my gosh we ended up in
 
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
the emergency room and I had no idea and
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
so they're sharing the symptoms that
 
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
their child had in order to let other
 
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
parents know hey if your kid acts like
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
this after being out in the cold or
 
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
being exposed to cold it also is eating
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
cold things try to tell a 5-year-old you
 
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
can't have ice cream not easy um so you
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
you have to be very aware of anything
 
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
and everything that can be that can
 
01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
trigger that disease and we're all
 
01:10:02.669 --> 01:10:02.679 align:start position:0%
different and we all react differently
 
01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
and you know some of them they can't
 
01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
even take a shower they take a shower
 
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
and they get out of the shower and they
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
reaction thank you any other questions

Bill
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
634 titled relative to the New Hampshire
 
01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
Council on autism spectrum
 
01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:13.640 align:start position:0%
disorders the purpose of this bill is to
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
update the mission and membership of the
 
01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Council on autism spectrum
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
disorders so that it can be more
 
01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
effective in serving the needs of
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
individuals and families living with
 
01:11:29.189 --> 01:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
autism across our
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
state as many of you know autism
 
01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
spectrum disorder affects a significant
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
number of individuals in New Hampshire
 
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
according to the CDC one in 36 children
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
in the US are diagnosed with autism and
 
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
we know that New Hampshire is no
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
exception our understanding of autism
 
01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
spectrum disorder or ASD continues to
 
01:11:56.629 --> 01:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
evolve and so so too must our support
 
01:11:56.639 --> 01:12:00.070 align:start position:0%
evolve and so so too must our support
and

01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.669 --> 01:12:02.679 align:start position:0%
services uh the council was created to
 
01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
advise state government on policy
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
services and programs related to a
 
01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
autism and to be a resource for
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
individuals and families impacted uh
 
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
this Council was created 15 years ago
 
01:12:18.629 --> 01:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
however as time has passed we realized
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
that some updates to the council's
 
01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
mission and membership are necessary to
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
keep Pace with the growing and diverse
 
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
needs of the autism community and its
 
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
utility is actually fallen off over the
 
01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
past 6 years and this bill is an
 
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
important step to revive the council and
 
01:12:39.070 --> 01:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
fulfill its Mission House Bill 634 Pro
 
01:12:41.709 --> 01:12:41.719 align:start position:0%
uh proposes key updates that will ensure
 
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:43.960 align:start position:0%
the council is truly representative of
 
01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
the various uh varied experiences within
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
the autism community and that has the
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
ability to address emerging needs uh
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
specifically uh this bill Alters the
 
01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.750 align:start position:0%
specifically uh this bill Alters the
membership

01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
membership
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh the bill proposes to add members uh
 
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
with a broader range of backgrounds but
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
also simplify the process to fill
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
vacancies where there are a large number
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
of them right now uh but further refines
 
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
the mission of the council uh basically
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
it narrowly focuses on enhancing uh
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
access to services and
 
01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
information uh and ensure that the
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
services are inclusive and available
 
01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
across the state of New Hampshire for
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
those who need access to
 
01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
information our state's autism Community
 
01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
is diverse and complex and as such our
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
efforts to support those with ASD must
 
01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
be flexible and responsive uh the
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
updates proposed in the house bill 634
 
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
are aimed at uh ensuring the New
 
01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Council on autism spectrum
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
disorders can become more effective in
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
addressing the needs of individuals with
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
autism and their family so I urge you uh
 
01:13:57.870 --> 01:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
to support this uh important bipartisan
 
01:13:59.830 --> 01:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
bill so that we can ensure that New
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire continues to be a place where
 
01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
all individuals regardless of their
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
challenges have the opportunity uh to
 
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
thrive uh I would like uh to further
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
mention that the the um uh contents of
 
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
this bill uh were as a recommended by
 
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
the council chair uh Vice chair and
 
01:14:22.590 --> 01:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
secretary and uh so pleased to bring
 
01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
that forward uh with that I'm happy to
 
01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you may have
 
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
but U some may be uh answered by others
 
01:14:33.709 --> 01:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
that are here as well thank
 
01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
you so based on your last sentence you
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
may not be the right person to answer so
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
feel free to pass if if you're not the
 
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
right one um we received an email from
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
somebody who suggests that actually the
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
right place to address these issues is
 
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
in the U developmental servic quality
 
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
Council and I wondered if you had any uh
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
thoughts on whether that was uh a better
 
01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:06.679 align:start position:0%
place uh a Le less effective place or or
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
just something that runs in parallel
 
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
well I will say you know that I I did
 
01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
read the the note that came in and the
 
01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
the author was nice enough to con uh to
 
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
copy the sponsors on the bill as well as
 
01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
the committee and I you know I think uh
 
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
that person's
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
frustration um you know with the with
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
the count
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know effectively not have not
 
01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
being fully staffed not not producing a
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
report is shared by the council itself
 
01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh I think that um the fact that the the
 
01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
members of the council uh are the ones
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
who are you know put forward putting
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
forward uh this solution uh or or uh you
 
01:15:50.669 --> 01:15:50.679 align:start position:0%
know this uh language in order to make
 
01:15:53.229 --> 01:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
the council more effective as and and
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
that we're not uh really looking at uh a
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
delu of effort uh I think it should be
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
you representative redwoods out in the
 
01:16:17.199 --> 01:16:25.470 align:start position:0%
you representative redwoods out in the
hall

01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards who is a
 
01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill uh thank you Mr
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee I um
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm here essentially to uh just
 
01:16:42.669 --> 01:16:42.679 align:start position:0%
back up and reinforce uh what the prime
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor said um he invited me to work
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
with him on this bill I've actually put
 
01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
in very little work uh on this bill but
 
01:16:55.709 --> 01:16:55.719 align:start position:0%
the the the clinching point the in point
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
of why I think you should be looking at
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is it's it's my understanding
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
that uh this board this commission has
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
been having trouble establishing quorums
 
01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
and because they can't establish quorums
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
regularly they're not producing they're
 
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
not gathering information they're not
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
producing reports so so whether this is
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
the right membership and approach to fix
 
01:17:25.229 --> 01:17:25.239 align:start position:0%
the quum issue um I I you you know
 
01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
you're you're in a better position for
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
that um but um if the board can't meet
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
it can't do its job and I think we want
 
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
it to do its job so so that's to me
 
01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
that's the main reason I'm supporting
 
01:17:42.189 --> 01:17:42.199 align:start position:0%
this bill let's give this uh committee
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to to to have their
 
01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
quorums and to gather the information
 
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
and to meet beyond that the fine-tuning
 
01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
of the membership and how they meet and
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
what they talk about that's that's uh
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
levels uh deeper than what I've really
 
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
looked at thank you any questions for
 
01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.149 align:start position:0%
looked at thank you any questions for
representative

01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:11.880 align:start position:0%

autism and Spectrum

01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
correctly okay okay
 
01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
great you've asked for five minutes
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
again closer to three would be great if
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
you can do
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
it you could turn on your microphone
 
01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
yeah at about there go there we go um so
 
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh esteemed chair members of the health
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
and human services and elderly Affairs
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Marissa ber I am a
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
member of the Council on autism spectrum
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
disorders and this council is uh their
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
role is outlined in RSA 171a col
 
01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
32 uh the proposed changes that were
 
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
outlined in this legislation were
 
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
developed based on feedback that we
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
received from people with Autism and
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
their family members and other people
 
01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
that support them during two feedback
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
sessions um we had some listening
 
01:19:14.629 --> 01:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
sessions in November of
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
2024 um and we really wanted to realign
 
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this uh Council to make
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
sure that it was serving its purpose and
 
01:19:25.629 --> 01:19:25.639 align:start position:0%
and really supporting people with Autism
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
in their families so some of those
 
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
highlights uh included that individuals
 
01:19:32.430 --> 01:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
with autism in their families wanted a
 
01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
greater presence on the council the
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
council should focus on educating
 
01:19:39.629 --> 01:19:39.639 align:start position:0%
individuals and families on resources
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
that were available to them there needed
 
01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
to be a way for adults with autism to
 
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
advocate for their real life concerns
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
and needs not what people thought they
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
needed professionals at all
 
01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
levels and the public need education on
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
autism and what it's like to experience
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
the world um with an Autism diagnosis
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
many people with Autism want jobs and
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
they want employers who understand the
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
positive aspects of employing someone
 
01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
with autism and people who understand
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
how to best support those
 
01:20:15.629 --> 01:20:15.639 align:start position:0%
employees and people with Autism should
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
not be the only ones advocating and
 
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
there is a need for in information and
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
education to be championed by
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
professionals as well
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
so the proposed changes to this
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
legislation include clarifying two
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
Council appointed seats for people with
 
01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
Autism adding a dedicated seat for a
 
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
family member bringing the total
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
dedicated to family members to two seats
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
clarifying that five at large members
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
will be appointed by the council and
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
although it's not outlined in the
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
language before you these were discussed
 
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
to be prioritized for people with Autism
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
or secondarily for family members of
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
some with somebody with
 
01:20:59.149 --> 01:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
autism um this also adds a seat for a
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire-based self- advocacy
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
organization adds a seat for a clinical
 
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
service provider who works with people
 
01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.030 align:start position:0%
service provider who works with people
with

01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
Autism um it also clarifies some roles
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
so clarifies that the role is to be
 
01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
aligned with available resources and
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
build on collaboration with other groups
 
01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:17.709 align:start position:0%
build on collaboration with other groups
and

01:21:17.709 --> 01:21:17.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
organizations and also clarifying that
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
they will make Reser recommendations on
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
best practices for supporting people
 
01:21:26.669 --> 01:21:26.679 align:start position:0%
with Autism and provide an online
 
01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
listing of resources for people and
 
01:21:31.629 --> 01:21:31.639 align:start position:0%
their families and others who support
 
01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
them in a personal or professional
 
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
capacity so we have heard from people
 
01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
with Autism and their families that
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
having a dedicated Council would be a
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
valuable way for them to Advocate and
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
access resources and that is why we have
 
01:21:48.990 --> 01:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh brought this legislation forth today
 
01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
and we really appreciate our our
 
01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
sponsors um for helping us with that and
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your time and I'm open
 
01:21:56.159 --> 01:21:57.070 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your time and I'm open
to

01:21:57.070 --> 01:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:21:59.669 --> 01:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you I I'm just reviewing the
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
makeup of the council as it is proposed
 
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
and I have the concern and
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
question uh about increasing the size
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
although I understand the balance is
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
different of an organization that's
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
already having trouble meeting its
 
01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
Quorum and that may be be so my my first
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
question is is the lack of a quorum
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
simply because not enough people have
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
been appointed or because not enough
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
people have shown up so we have been in
 
01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
significantly increasing the number of
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
people who show up one of the things
 
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
that has been slowing us down a little
 
01:22:44.110 --> 01:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
bit is that a lot of those seats are
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
Governor appointed so um what this does
 
01:22:49.149 --> 01:22:49.159 align:start position:0%
is this changes the language so that
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's Council appointed um but also
 
01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
includes a the governor or a design as
 
01:22:56.510 --> 01:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
as part of that that is one of the
 
01:22:59.790 --> 01:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
vacant seats right now um so out of
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
those vacant seats that we don't have to
 
01:23:05.629 --> 01:23:05.639 align:start position:0%
meet Quorum six of those are for family
 
01:23:09.669 --> 01:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
members um that require uh some sort of
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
involvement from um the governor uh to
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
to be appointed may have a follow follow
 
01:23:19.149 --> 01:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
thank you that's very helpful um and the
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
other question I have although I it's a
 
01:23:26.430 --> 01:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
technique that I often
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
deplore is have you considered lowering
 
01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
simply lowering the Quorum requirements
 
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
because that happens often with
 
01:23:36.669 --> 01:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
committees yeah so we do have language
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
in here uh that aligns with the current
 
01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
language for uh 91a so I'm not sure how
 
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm unfortunately I'm not
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
familiar enough to know uh how much
 
01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:53.239 align:start position:0%
outside of 91a we are able to go that we
 
01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
are simply expecting that um you know we
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
we do have to follow those guidelines
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
there is language in here though uh that
 
01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
allows um for individuals with
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities um to count toward a quorum
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
um because we had seen there was some
 
01:24:12.669 --> 01:24:12.679 align:start position:0%
precedent for that with the quality
 
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
Council to make sure you know many
 
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities don't have
 
01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
access to any sort of Transportation
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
they can't necessarily Drive um public
 
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
transportation is scarce so
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
so am I correct in thinking that that's
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
allowing them to participate remotely
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
and count as part of the Quorum correct
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that's very helpful
 
01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.629 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that's very helpful
other

01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none okay thank you
 
01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:44.709 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none okay thank you
thank

01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is is Adora
 
01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
Rodriguez leand from the New Hampshire
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
morning there you go oh yeah when the
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
red light is on you all set so for the
 
01:25:07.709 --> 01:25:07.719 align:start position:0%
record my name is isidora Rodriguez
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
LeAndre I serve as the executive
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
director at the New Hampshire Council on
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities I'm also
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
currently the interim Vice chair of the
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
um Council on autism spectrum disorder
 
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
and um a Ed member on the New Hampshire
 
01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
developmental Services quality Council
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
so I may be able to shed a little bit of
 
01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
light on how all those are different and
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
the intent of having a dedicated Council
 
01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
for individuals and families who
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
experience Autism Spectrum
 
01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:47.719 align:start position:0%
Disorder so I have um written testimony
 
01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
I won't go through and read all of it
 
01:25:54.669 --> 01:25:54.679 align:start position:0%
but um having heard some of the previous
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
testimony and some of the questions I I
 
01:25:59.950 --> 01:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
would like to point out that yes indeed
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
um this request would allow for
 
01:26:06.910 --> 01:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
individuals and family members impacted
 
01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
by disability to count towards in-person
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
Quorum um for that group we uh in the
 
01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
last couple of meetings have seen you
 
01:26:19.109 --> 01:26:19.119 align:start position:0%
know upwards of you know 20 people
 
01:26:21.629 --> 01:26:21.639 align:start position:0%
participating online but the in-person
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
Quorum is what's been difficult to meet
 
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
and so this would allow for onethird of
 
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
the membership to be have to be in
 
01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
person versus half um and for anyone
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
online who experiences a disability or
 
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
has a family member who experiences a
 
01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
disability to be counted towards
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
inperson Quorum if they are
 
01:26:45.390 --> 01:26:45.400 align:start position:0%
participating remotely um the other
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
thing that I would like to point out is
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
that um the New Hampshire developmental
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
Services quality Council specifically
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
targets people who are receiving
 
01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
supports and services in the
 
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
developmental services and the Brain
 
01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
Injury um Services
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
systems however a lot of folks who are
 
01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:12.280 align:start position:0%
autistic autistic um have very different
 
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
functional and support needs than those
 
01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
that are provided through the
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
developmental Services System so a lot
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
of times people with Autism don't even
 
01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
qualify for services because they may
 
01:27:25.870 --> 01:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
not have an intell ual disability or a
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
functional need that makes them eligible
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
and so that makes this Council very
 
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
unique in that it can help identify the
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
needs and address the needs of folks who
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily qualify for paid
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
Services through our system and that is
 
01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
a big um difference from all of the
 
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
other councils uh that exist
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
currently um I think the last point I
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
have is that it's really important to
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
elevate the voices of those who
 
01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
experience um disability and autism
 
01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
specifically um and their family members
 
01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that uh any any uh goals
 
01:28:08.910 --> 01:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
and objectives and activities are led by
 
01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
people with Autism and um that is why we
 
01:28:14.669 --> 01:28:14.679 align:start position:0%
are looking to increase the membership
 
01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
and we have seen people with lived
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
experience kind of show up at these
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
meetings virtually but it is difficult
 
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
to get the agency seat if you will in
 
01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:26.590 align:start position:0%
to get the agency seat if you will in
the

01:28:26.590 --> 01:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:29.629 --> 01:28:29.639 align:start position:0%
room sure I'm on another commission
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
myself and I know it was some of the
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
agencies were very slow in making their
 
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
appointments and the statute of this
 
01:28:39.629 --> 01:28:39.639 align:start position:0%
particular commission said there it's a
 
01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
14 member commission 8 constitute a
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
quorum and when you don't have all 14
 
01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
appointed it can be difficult to get to
 
01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any thank you very
 
01:28:57.229 --> 01:28:57.239 align:start position:0%

01:29:02.590 --> 01:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
testify in HB 634 does anyone else wish
 
01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:03.950 align:start position:0%
testify in HB 634 does anyone else wish

01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
I've worked for 30 years um advocating
 
01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
for the rights of people with
 
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
disabilities including pain um my
 
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
primary focus in life has been to
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
achieve a public policy balance between
 
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
the needs of those in pain and those
 
01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
with addiction and um I would say that
 
01:30:13.149 --> 01:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
for the most part that's been a total
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
failure but we can never stop trying um
 
01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
I also am the uh acting chair of the
 
01:30:21.310 --> 01:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement commission and I'm the
 
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
chair of the State Health assessment and
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
State Health implementation plan Council
 
01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
and um this bill that we're talking
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
about today is very important for both
 
01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
of those um I'm honored that my two
 
01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
friends here um representative Edwards
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
and Senator waters are here um I call
 
01:30:40.990 --> 01:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
this a quick sand Bill not for the
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
reason you might think but Senator
 
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
Waters proposed this bill last session
 
01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
and I basically got sucked into it I
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
didn't sponsor it but the more I heard
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
about it the more I liked about it the
 
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
more important it got the more work we
 
01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
put into it to give you a little history
 
01:30:58.590 --> 01:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
and while I'm talking on page three and
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
four of the bill is a definition of harm
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
reduction rather than me go over that in
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
detail I thought you could take a peek
 
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
at that but anyways um the reason why
 
01:31:10.750 --> 01:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
this bill came up was because we're
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
already doing harm reduction um it's the
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
one of the pillars of the governor's
 
01:31:18.430 --> 01:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
commission um the opioid Oatman
 
01:31:20.830 --> 01:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
commission allows this as a reason for
 
01:31:23.629 --> 01:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
uh Distributing funds as one of their 19
 
01:31:26.950 --> 01:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
indic ation so we're already doing it
 
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
the problem is unlike other things that
 
01:31:31.149 --> 01:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
we do there's a little bit of
 
01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
controversy in it and there was a
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
feeling that since the term harm
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
reduction and the concept did not appear
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
anywhere in statute that it needed to
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
get there and that and I'm speaking for
 
01:31:43.709 --> 01:31:43.719 align:start position:0%
the senator but that was pretty much
 
01:31:45.629 --> 01:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
what led to this the history of the bill
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
was that um it was brought up in the
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
Senate it passed in the HHS committee
 
01:31:53.950 --> 01:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
there five Z was Voice vote in their
 
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
finance and and then in the Senate that
 
01:31:59.149 --> 01:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
then came to us in this committee where
 
01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
we sent it without a recommendation
 
01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
initially but on my good friend um
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt and I sat down
 
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
worked on this at length to try to get a
 
01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
good definition of what harm reduction
 
01:32:13.149 --> 01:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
meant for us and um with that we were
 
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
able to pass the bill um or at least the
 
01:32:18.030 --> 01:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that we created um I give you
 
01:32:24.109 --> 01:32:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:26.119 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't normally use notes but it
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
was 249 to
 
01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
1227 and then it passed the house at 359
 
01:32:33.709 --> 01:32:33.719 align:start position:0%
to 18 it then went to the finance
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
commission where my um my friend um
 
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
decided that it needed more work and it
 
01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
went to an her study and you know at
 
01:32:42.510 --> 01:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
first I was really angry about that
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
because I put a lot of effort into this
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
but the more we talked the more it
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
became apparent that he was right and to
 
01:32:52.510 --> 01:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
his credit um He suggests that we sit
 
01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
down over the summer and meet and so
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
Patrick tus from the governor's
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
commission U Senator Waters myself and
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
and representative Edwards sat down
 
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
several times over the summer to try to
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
figure out how to make this workable so
 
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
that we could all be at least somewhat
 
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
miserable but nobody really miserable
 
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
with the outcome and I think this Bild
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
achieves that
 
01:33:17.109 --> 01:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
um it's important that you know a little
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
bit about what harm reduction is and
 
01:33:22.590 --> 01:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
it's in the bill but there was a
 
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
document that was created that tried to
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
align the strategies of the opioid
 
01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:28.280 align:start position:0%
abatement commission and the governor's
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
commission and it basically looked at
 
01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
all the things that we used do for
 
01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:33.560 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder and like where
 
01:33:35.950 --> 01:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
are the gaps how do can we use this
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
money to really solve problems in our
 
01:33:40.030 --> 01:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
society help people save lives things
 
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
like that and what was interesting when
 
01:33:43.870 --> 01:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
they came up with it there were huge
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
gaps in two things number one was
 
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
prevention and number two was family
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
support and so that really raised a lot
 
01:33:55.709 --> 01:33:55.719 align:start position:0%
of red flags for me as to how this
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
legislation could make a difference
 
01:34:01.870 --> 01:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
there um so that's basically where we
 
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
came from but prevention has three
 
01:34:05.629 --> 01:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
elements to it and this is a public
 
01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
health thing this isn't just an
 
01:34:09.109 --> 01:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
addiction thing but we differentiate
 
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
them between primary secondary and
 
01:34:13.709 --> 01:34:13.719 align:start position:0%
tertiary primary is where we prevent the
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
problem from happening in the first
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
place secondary is early diagnosis or
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
early assessment and then nip the B nip
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
the thing in the bud before it happens
 
01:34:26.350 --> 01:34:26.360 align:start position:0%
example every one of you is in a county
 
01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
delegation you all have an office of
 
01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
restorative justice that's what they do
 
01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
they do secondary prevention tertiary
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
prevention thoughs a different story the
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
problem is ingrained it's complicated
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
and our goal is not necessarily I mean
 
01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
it would be nice if we can eradicate the
 
01:34:44.590 --> 01:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
problem but our goal is to prevent the
 
01:34:46.830 --> 01:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
consequences or minimize the the damage
 
01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
that the consequences can do and that's
 
01:34:51.550 --> 01:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
functionally what harm reduction does
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
it's already in legislation ter AR
 
01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
prevention is in legislation but the
 
01:34:59.470 --> 01:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
words harm reduction is not um the bill
 
01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
itself I think has laudible goals um I
 
01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
did you want to go over that or do you
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
want me to go over what's in the bill
 
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
now let me do it all right fine all
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
right good give me more time to talk
 
01:35:17.070 --> 01:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
here so um the legislation has several
 
01:35:21.550 --> 01:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
elements to it um the first element is
 
01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
um is to provide some level of oversight
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
like for example um we provide Naran for
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
people we provide um sterile needles we
 
01:35:34.030 --> 01:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
provide uh sexually transmitted disease
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
counseling we provide a doorways program
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
that allows access to other things we do
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
all that right now and this bill would
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
allow all those things to continue one
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the controversial issues should we
 
01:35:48.189 --> 01:35:48.199 align:start position:0%
allow safe Drug Administration sites I
 
01:35:49.950 --> 01:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
don't know that we're ready for that
 
01:35:52.590 --> 01:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
that would not allow that to happen the
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
question is should there or should not
 
01:35:56.229 --> 01:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
there be financial support and how is
 
01:35:58.669 --> 01:35:58.679 align:start position:0%
that done that was in the original Bill
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
we came to the conclusion that that
 
01:36:03.109 --> 01:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't is not necessary the funding for
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
all these programs already exists and we
 
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
don't need to provide that um this was
 
01:36:09.390 --> 01:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
an interesting one that I had never
 
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
really thought about but when you're
 
01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
applying for grants for programs
 
01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
terminology is really important you know
 
01:36:18.669 --> 01:36:18.679 align:start position:0%
so if if we're using one language
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
tertiary prevention and this other group
 
01:36:23.070 --> 01:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
samsa is using harm reduction then we're
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
not using the the same language and it
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
makes aligning our grant requests a lot
 
01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
more difficult so by using this bill
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
we're able to actually allow um our
 
01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state to use the
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
same language to more effectively
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
compete um there was an element in the
 
01:36:40.590 --> 01:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
original bill that allowed for promotion
 
01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
or education of Health Care Providers it
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
went way too far only because everything
 
01:36:48.109 --> 01:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
it it put in there already existed so we
 
01:36:52.350 --> 01:36:52.360 align:start position:0%
did eliminate that um the doorways
 
01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
program is really important it's like a
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
an easy access program it's a hub and
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
spoke model in the state if you have a
 
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
problem 24/7 you can go to one of nine
 
01:37:04.189 --> 01:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
centers that's the Hub they will then
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
spoke you out to whoever provides those
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
services and most of us agree that
 
01:37:10.510 --> 01:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
that's important it's an important harm
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
reduction technique um it exists now
 
01:37:15.790 --> 01:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
like a lot of programs there's a danger
 
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
it could not exist so the this bill
 
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
allows um that to
 
01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
continue um let's see what else should
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
we talk talk about this is the most
 
01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
important part of what I call our
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
compromise so I've been working with
 
01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:32.360 align:start position:0%
people in pain for a long time I've been
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
working with people with addiction for a
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
long time I've lived a lot of my life
 
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
with people in pain and I've lived a lot
 
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
of my life with people with
 
01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
addiction the problem that I've had with
 
01:37:44.589 --> 01:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
the whole concept of harm reduction is
 
01:37:47.109 --> 01:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
that although this is not in the sza
 
01:37:49.709 --> 01:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
definition before you is that we focus a
 
01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
lot on the addict and not on the people
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
around them if you look at the Society
 
01:37:56.669 --> 01:37:56.679 align:start position:0%
of American society of addiction
 
01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
medicine's definition of addiction they
 
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
say it's basically aberant Behavior
 
01:38:04.669 --> 01:38:04.679 align:start position:0%
continue despite harm to the self the
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
old definition said the self and you
 
01:38:08.589 --> 01:38:08.599 align:start position:0%
those around you and that really
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
bothered me that they took that out I
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
think that people with addiction have
 
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
are neurophys are victims of their
 
01:38:17.470 --> 01:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
neurophysiological self but at some
 
01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
level they're also perpetrators the
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
things that they do do a lot of harm to
 
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
the people around them and what
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
concerned me about the whole concept of
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
harm reduction is that it doesn't take
 
01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
those people into effect for example um
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%
my family had to bury two people with
 
01:38:38.430 --> 01:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
therosis of liver last in last three
 
01:38:41.390 --> 01:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
years um from a lifelong history of
 
01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:42.910 align:start position:0%
years um from a lifelong history of
alcoholism

01:38:42.910 --> 01:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
alcoholism
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
um you wouldn't believe how much anger
 
01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
there is you know what they did to their
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
families in the process of their
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
alcoholism and how you wanted to shake
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
them tell them to stop
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
whatever and and the family support was
 
01:38:58.830 --> 01:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
lacking but they had 12 step programs
 
01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
they could go to they had this that and
 
01:39:02.350 --> 01:39:02.360 align:start position:0%
the other thing and that's why changing
 
01:39:04.149 --> 01:39:04.159 align:start position:0%
the way we conceptualize what we were
 
01:39:06.270 --> 01:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
doing was important so I'm going to give
 
01:39:09.229 --> 01:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
full credit to um representative Edwards
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
for coming this up with this but we
 
01:39:13.470 --> 01:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
changed the term conceptually from harm
 
01:39:15.629 --> 01:39:15.639 align:start position:0%
reduction to reduction of societal and
 
01:39:18.669 --> 01:39:18.679 align:start position:0%
individual harm if you go through the
 
01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
bill um it's actually very simple and
 
01:39:25.229 --> 01:39:25.239 align:start position:0%
complex at the same time but everything
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
in Black in the bill is new um but all
 
01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
this is is the the the statute that
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
creates the governor's commission um it
 
01:39:37.709 --> 01:39:37.719 align:start position:0%
changes the words um um harm reduction
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
which was in the past to including
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
reduction of society individual harm
 
01:39:44.109 --> 01:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
every word time the word abuse happens
 
01:39:46.709 --> 01:39:46.719 align:start position:0%
it um changes that to misuse which was a
 
01:39:50.350 --> 01:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
real problem for me um
 
01:39:52.750 --> 01:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
because we don't use that terminology
 
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
and pain management and I was really
 
01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
afraid that we would harm my patients so
 
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
there's two places in the bill where we
 
01:40:00.510 --> 01:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
protect my patients rights to access to
 
01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
these things um the definition of of
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
harm reduction at least from a SSA point
 
01:40:07.390 --> 01:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
of view comes in here with some guard
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
rails that for example you cannot do a
 
01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
self Drug Administration site um what
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
else I think that's pretty much
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
everything that I have um I did Define
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
misuse in this I insisted that stay in
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
there because abuse is really what we're
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
looking at not misuse for example I
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
would bet every one of you has misused a
 
01:40:33.229 --> 01:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
a a prescription drug in your life if
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
you took a drug that was prescribed to
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
you for a reason other than it was
 
01:40:39.589 --> 01:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
prescribed to you you misuse that and
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
that is the far the most common cause of
 
01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
misuse how many of you took that coding
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
that you had from a dentist for your hip
 
01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
when it your hip hurt or an antibiotic
 
01:40:50.070 --> 01:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
for a reason that it wasn't so you
 
01:40:52.750 --> 01:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
you're functionally a criminal um most
 
01:40:54.669 --> 01:40:54.679 align:start position:0%
the majority of misuse is actually
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
something that subtle that's not what
 
01:40:58.149 --> 01:40:58.159 align:start position:0%
we're talking about and that's why it
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
was important to me that we Define what
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
we were talking about because the term
 
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
misuse is now used in the addiction
 
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:23.589 --> 01:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
you and Senator Waters welcome I was I
 
01:41:26.109 --> 01:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
was just about to call you so thank you
 
01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
Senator David Waters from District 4
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh Mr chairman
 
01:41:32.350 --> 01:41:32.360 align:start position:0%
members of the committee Senator David
 
01:41:33.990 --> 01:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
Waters District 4 and we're playing tag
 
01:41:35.709 --> 01:41:35.719 align:start position:0%
team with representative Edwards and he
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
thought I should come up now I don't
 
01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:40.360 align:start position:0%
often come into um house hearings on
 
01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
bills that I'm not the prime sponsor but
 
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
I really wanted to be here to to applaud
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
um representative Edwards and
 
01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel hear that I should
 
01:41:50.669 --> 01:41:50.679 align:start position:0%
come up now did you want to join him um
 
01:41:52.589 --> 01:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
no I just was mentioning you that's all
 
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
yeah all right come up whenever you want
 
01:41:58.750 --> 01:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
um so uh we did put a lot of work in
 
01:42:00.189 --> 01:42:00.199 align:start position:0%
this bill and I I really want to thank
 
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards and particular
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
for holding U you know holding this bill
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
so that we come up with a better bill
 
01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
that had a real consensus as to how to
 
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
move forward on a on a difficult issue
 
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
I'd like to point out uh briefly just
 
01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
exactly what the bill um does and why it
 
01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
was first brought forward a couple of
 
01:42:19.589 --> 01:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
years ago uh like representative Edwards
 
01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of the governor's
 
01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
Commission on Alcohol and Other Drugs
 
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
and three years ago it started its
 
01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
strategic planning and decided to create
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
a new task force on what it was calling
 
01:42:33.070 --> 01:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
harm reduction and it seemed to me that
 
01:42:34.229 --> 01:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
if they were going to have that as one
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
of their four pillars that we ought to
 
01:42:39.589 --> 01:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
have that in the legislation for the
 
01:42:42.350 --> 01:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
commission to authorize that and uh then
 
01:42:45.070 --> 01:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
to provide some definition of it so that
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
was the original impetus and that's what
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
we worked on here to get the language um
 
01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
which I think very wisely represented
 
01:42:54.189 --> 01:42:54.199 align:start position:0%
Edwards um brought forward to say
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
including reduction of societal and
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
individual harm so if you look on um
 
01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
page two at the bottom you will see that
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
that has been added to the four main
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
areas of the governor's commission and
 
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
then thus gives the commission authority
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
to pursue that as one of its main areas
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
um and as has been mentioned previously
 
01:43:19.070 --> 01:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
you have a very careful definition of
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
what we are referring to reduction of
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
societal and individual harm I think it
 
01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
is really an effective one that we
 
01:43:29.229 --> 01:43:29.239 align:start position:0%
notice we're trying to deal with the
 
01:43:32.030 --> 01:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
folks who have substance uses disorder
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
but that has impacts on their
 
01:43:35.189 --> 01:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
communities and municipalities and their
 
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
Municipal budget so we have to look at
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
both together and understand what the
 
01:43:42.669 --> 01:43:42.679 align:start position:0%
commission and uh what the prevention
 
01:43:44.589 --> 01:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
programs and recovery programs can do to
 
01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that the larger Community uh
 
01:43:50.270 --> 01:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
is addressed as as well I thought it was
 
01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
particularly important in this bill to
 
01:43:54.589 --> 01:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
add the president of the New Hampshire
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
Association of chiefs of police that
 
01:43:59.510 --> 01:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
this bill envisions a much stronger
 
01:44:01.629 --> 01:44:01.639 align:start position:0%
partnership with local police
 
01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
departments so that they have a say in
 
01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
how these um
 
01:44:10.149 --> 01:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
societal uh and individual harm
 
01:44:13.149 --> 01:44:13.159 align:start position:0%
reduction programs are conducted I think
 
01:44:15.589 --> 01:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
some municipalities like my Municipality
 
01:44:17.709 --> 01:44:17.719 align:start position:0%
of Dober has had very good partnership
 
01:44:20.350 --> 01:44:20.360 align:start position:0%
with recovery organizations um and the
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
police department and the social worker
 
01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
in the police department I think some
 
01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
departments have felt that they have
 
01:44:27.149 --> 01:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
been a little cut out when it comes to
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
deciding where and how such programs are
 
01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
operate so you see in the language a
 
01:44:34.030 --> 01:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
little bit later in the bill it
 
01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
specifies that there must be
 
01:44:39.589 --> 01:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
consultation with local police forces I
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
think this is an important tool
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
particularly for Manchester and other um
 
01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:45.679 align:start position:0%
other cities we are meeting with mayor
 
01:44:48.189 --> 01:44:48.199 align:start position:0%
Ru on on this bill next week um and I
 
01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:50.360 align:start position:0%
think that this is will form a much
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
stronger partnership uh with law
 
01:44:54.910 --> 01:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement and and with these recovery
 
01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:55.990 align:start position:0%
enforcement and and with these recovery
um

01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:59.709 --> 01:44:59.719 align:start position:0%
efforts um so I won't rehearse again on
 
01:45:03.550 --> 01:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
page four but I I think that uh this um
 
01:45:05.310 --> 01:45:05.320 align:start position:0%
essentially identifies a lot of the
 
01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
activities that there is bipartisan and
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
Municipal and state consensus on with
 
01:45:12.910 --> 01:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
HHS of the kinds of activities that are
 
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
involved in uh in harm harm reduction um
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
and uh then I would also you know the
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
last thing I'll really point to um is on
 
01:45:26.189 --> 01:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
page uh
 
01:45:29.589 --> 01:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
8 or the doorways
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
program um I think that the doorways
 
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
program is one of Governor sununu's
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
great legacies uh he established them by
 
01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
executive order at a period of
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
extraordinary crisis with uh opioid um
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
misuse and and and deaths in the state
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
we were after West Virginia hardest hit
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
by the opioid crisis per capita second
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
highest number of of deaths and Governor
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
sunu stepped forward we had substantial
 
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
grant funding and said we will establish
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
this this doorway program where in the
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
communities across the state there is a
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
one place to go where people can connect
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
with services and uh I I think you know
 
01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
I talked with the governor about this
 
01:46:16.350 --> 01:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
last year and I said you know when we
 
01:46:18.189 --> 01:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
have executive orders after a few years
 
01:46:19.709 --> 01:46:19.719 align:start position:0%
when they've proven themselves it's I
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
think it's very important to have it in
 
01:46:23.629 --> 01:46:23.639 align:start position:0%
statute so that they statutory Authority
 
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
and the doorways program um now as
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see described um and this is a
 
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
language that I was given through Health
 
01:46:34.830 --> 01:46:34.840 align:start position:0%
Human Services as a an appropriate way
 
01:46:36.669 --> 01:46:36.679 align:start position:0%
to define what the doorways program is
 
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
and now we'll have it in statute and um
 
01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
the appropriate legislative involvement
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
uh there as as well I had pointed to the
 
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
um law enforcement issues you'll see on
 
01:46:50.350 --> 01:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
that same page on page eight down around
 
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh line 22 I think this is the Crux the
 
01:46:55.589 --> 01:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
matter um coordinate and collaborate
 
01:46:58.189 --> 01:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
with other local agencies including law
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies and I think that's
 
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
just really crucial thing that the bill
 
01:47:07.629 --> 01:47:07.639 align:start position:0%
uh does as well um so uh with that the
 
01:47:09.629 --> 01:47:09.639 align:start position:0%
only other comment I'll make is that I
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
think the drafting attorney just took
 
01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
the original bill on the effective date
 
01:47:16.470 --> 01:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
and added two years to it um I don't
 
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
know that we necessarily have to wait
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
until July 1st 2026 um I think would be
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
awfully good
 
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
to get the uh police chief onto the
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
commission as soon as the bill passes
 
01:47:30.030 --> 01:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
and to have the other tools for law
 
01:47:32.189 --> 01:47:32.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement as well as the doorways
 
01:47:34.109 --> 01:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
program and statute so I mean please do
 
01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
consider whether we whether it seemed
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate to say the usual 60 days
 
01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
after passage or upon passage instead of
 
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
the 2026 so thank you Mr chairman for
 
01:47:45.790 --> 01:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
your time thank you thank you any
 
01:47:48.990 --> 01:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
questions repres uh representative Weber
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
well that last comment kind of bed the
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
question why was 2020 six put in here to
 
01:47:57.310 --> 01:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
begin with given that this is an
 
01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
existing commission that's being
 
01:48:00.510 --> 01:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
modified rather than something that's
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
being set up to begin with so why choose
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
2026 in the drafting process thanks for
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
the question I I think that what they
 
01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679 align:start position:0%
did is that they had the bill that you
 
01:48:11.310 --> 01:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
know the original bill which had the
 
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
2024 data on it and I think they just
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
added two years to it because it was the
 
01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:17.470 align:start position:0%
added two years to it because it was the
older

01:48:17.470 --> 01:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
older
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
Bill uh so I I I think that it more
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
appropriately would be um July 1st 2025
 
01:48:27.070 --> 01:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
or upon P 60 days after passage but um
 
01:48:28.510 --> 01:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
maybe representive Edwards have some
 
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
comments on I I just wanted specifically
 
01:48:34.990 --> 01:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
to know whether upon passage or 60 days
 
01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
after passage what would be your
 
01:48:39.070 --> 01:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
preference if we have July 1 it's sort
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
of an
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
arbitrary yeah I I mean you know who
 
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
knows when bills get signed right so I I
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
think 60 days would be appropriate um
 
01:48:50.350 --> 01:48:50.360 align:start position:0%
just some time for the okay you know for
 
01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
the for the agencies to do it they may
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:59.790 --> 01:48:59.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:49:03.149 --> 01:49:03.159 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr chairman Senator good
 
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
to see you uh on it says a
 
01:49:10.589 --> 01:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
representative of the state's
 
01:49:10.599 --> 01:49:11.790 align:start position:0%
representative of the state's
faith-based

01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:11.800 align:start position:0%
faith-based
 
01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
commun faith-based Community who shall
 
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
be a nonvoting
 
01:49:20.830 --> 01:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
member why is why is that in there I
 
01:49:23.229 --> 01:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
mean it seems very strange
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
that uh that that's on page
 
01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
23 that's the existing
 
01:49:37.709 --> 01:49:37.719 align:start position:0%
language it's is there any reason why we
 
01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:40.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't take that out I mean what why
 
01:49:43.390 --> 01:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
is he on there if he can't vote I uh
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question representative
 
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
um you know I this this commission was
 
01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
established a number of years ago in
 
01:49:51.950 --> 01:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
statute I this is that's the existing
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
statutary line if the wisdom of this
 
01:49:55.550 --> 01:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
committee is that they'd like to change
 
01:49:57.390 --> 01:49:57.400 align:start position:0%
that that's the wisdom of the committee
 
01:50:00.750 --> 01:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I used to serve on that
 
01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
questions did you have a clarification
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:50:18.109 --> 01:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you for the question it was
 
01:50:20.229 --> 01:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
a good question um faith-based
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
communities do an awful lot of on the
 
01:50:26.229 --> 01:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
ground work in addiction management um
 
01:50:28.270 --> 01:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
and so I think that was probably why
 
01:50:29.669 --> 01:50:29.679 align:start position:0%
they were included in this because they
 
01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
are really critical to the work we do in
 
01:50:32.910 --> 01:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of different
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
ways I suppose they might have to recuse
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
themselves um frequently so but I again
 
01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:40.719 align:start position:0%
I this is the existing language so I
 
01:50:42.990 --> 01:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
don't really have an answer to
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
it representative Woods did you have
 
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
01:50:49.069 --> 01:50:49.079 align:start position:0%
up representative har
 
01:50:51.390 --> 01:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
haret thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
taking the question I'm uh very
 
01:50:55.950 --> 01:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
appreciative of this bill helping you
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
bring harm reduction into Focus for the
 
01:51:00.510 --> 01:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
state it's wonderful just had a couple
 
01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
questions about needle exchange um is
 
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
there any evidence that needle exchange
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
increases intravenous drug use thanks
 
01:51:11.310 --> 01:51:11.320 align:start position:0%
for the question uh I'm not a scholar on
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
this but I think HHS can point to
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
studies that it it uh does not it is I
 
01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
was here in the legislature um when with
 
01:51:22.069 --> 01:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
Senator gray and others we passed that
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
it really is disease prevention it's
 
01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:25.390 align:start position:0%
it really is disease prevention it's
about

01:51:25.390 --> 01:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:29.159 align:start position:0%
HIV um it's about he hepatitis it's
 
01:51:31.950 --> 01:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
about heart disease um and so that's
 
01:51:34.350 --> 01:51:34.360 align:start position:0%
that's been the main that was that's why
 
01:51:36.750 --> 01:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
we passed that program and again there's
 
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
no change to it here in this bill
 
01:51:42.669 --> 01:51:42.679 align:start position:0%
followup uh just a a slightly different
 
01:51:45.229 --> 01:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
subject is there any uh evidence about
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh syring exchanges
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease the likelihood of
 
01:51:52.750 --> 01:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
Engagement and treatment
 
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
um thanks for the that question and I I
 
01:51:56.790 --> 01:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
can actually answer that um personally
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
because um I have been out to um you
 
01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
know to I've been out with some of the
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
recovery organizations um that offer
 
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
these services and nashille in
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
particular I went out to parking lot
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
behind the library where they go up a
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
few days a week and and provide the uh
 
01:52:18.069 --> 01:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
the kits and so on and um to participate
 
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
in needo exchange program you have to
 
01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:52:24.430 --> 01:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
card um and what I saw was that these
 
01:52:25.790 --> 01:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
were people who were known and had
 
01:52:27.550 --> 01:52:27.560 align:start position:0%
familiarity relationships with the
 
01:52:29.669 --> 01:52:29.679 align:start position:0%
people delivering the services so there
 
01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
was a check-in about their health about
 
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
recovery they're also Distributing the
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
lock Zone and so they can have
 
01:52:40.109 --> 01:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
conversations about what were their
 
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
incidents in which that was used and so
 
01:52:46.350 --> 01:52:46.360 align:start position:0%
um I saw relationships develop there and
 
01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:47.639 align:start position:0%
I've talked to other recovery
 
01:52:49.229 --> 01:52:49.239 align:start position:0%
organizations and they say the needle
 
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
exchange programs and they offer other
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
services too because they say line and
 
01:52:55.830 --> 01:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh health health kits of various kinds
 
01:52:58.950 --> 01:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
to offer to to people and they all they
 
01:53:02.069 --> 01:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
they tell me that this can this point of
 
01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
contact and relationship can be
 
01:53:05.589 --> 01:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily important for getting
 
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
people to take the next step to uh enter
 
01:53:12.030 --> 01:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
recovery programs and treatment so I I I
 
01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
I I don't know what kind of Statistics
 
01:53:15.790 --> 01:53:15.800 align:start position:0%
may may be but I can just that one I can
 
01:53:17.629 --> 01:53:17.639 align:start position:0%
speak for my personal
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
much also signed up to speak is
 
01:53:34.030 --> 01:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
Edwards you say your testimony is going
 
01:53:37.709 --> 01:53:37.719 align:start position:0%
to last six minutes if it could be
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
shorter that would be wonderful I I I'll
 
01:53:43.069 --> 01:53:43.079 align:start position:0%
I'll try um there's an they they've said
 
01:53:46.030 --> 01:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
a lot um but uh I've got some things
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
that I think are important for the
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
context of this I'm representative Jess
 
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:51.960 align:start position:0%

Deerfield
 
01:54:03.709 --> 01:54:03.719 align:start position:0%
um now uh I last year um as the chair of
 
01:54:05.709 --> 01:54:05.719 align:start position:0%
division three I'm the chair again this
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
year um uh the bill came to me to our
 
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
our our committee it had passed the
 
01:54:14.910 --> 01:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
Senate it had gone to the house it
 
01:54:17.709 --> 01:54:17.719 align:start position:0%
passed the house policy committee passed
 
01:54:19.870 --> 01:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
the house with a pretty overwhelming
 
01:54:22.830 --> 01:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
vote and it came to me and I looked at
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
it and I had some real issues with it
 
01:54:28.510 --> 01:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
and so I tugged on Superman's cape a
 
01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
little bit uh messing with a a senator's
 
01:54:34.830 --> 01:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
Bill and a bill that this committee had
 
01:54:37.629 --> 01:54:37.639 align:start position:0%
supported uh but I I thought it needed
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
to be done and I'll I'll explain to you
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
you know why that was and that
 
01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
is um you you need to understand how the
 
01:54:49.830 --> 01:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
governor's commission operates with its
 
01:54:53.069 --> 01:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
money uh the legislature has set it up
 
01:54:56.430 --> 01:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
to where the the the default um funding
 
01:54:59.229 --> 01:54:59.239 align:start position:0%
for that commission is at 5% of the
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
alcohol Fund in this coming budget cycle
 
01:55:04.109 --> 01:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
we think that's going to be about $1
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
million somewhere in that range um and
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh the the then that money goes to the
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
commission the commission has I don't
 
01:55:17.109 --> 01:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
know 40 some people from around the
 
01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
state stakeholders to uh talk and they
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
get put on various tasks Force within
 
01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
the committee and they form a budget uh
 
01:55:28.069 --> 01:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
and then they vote on the budget they
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
act as a miniature legislature with
 
01:55:34.390 --> 01:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
their focus on the the the pillars that
 
01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh the senator had just explained um and
 
01:55:40.990 --> 01:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
when they come up with uh their budget
 
01:55:43.790 --> 01:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
and they vote on it that starts the
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
process of generating contracts the only
 
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
check on their decision to spend money
 
01:55:54.629 --> 01:55:54.639 align:start position:0%
becomes the executive counsel cu the
 
01:55:57.870 --> 01:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
legislature has delegated the the the
 
01:56:01.310 --> 01:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
money to them and delegated the decision
 
01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:04.639 align:start position:0%
authority to them to determine what gets
 
01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
how the money gets spent and then it's
 
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
only the executive Council that serves
 
01:56:12.189 --> 01:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
as the people's check if if um if
 
01:56:14.350 --> 01:56:14.360 align:start position:0%
there's a disagreement about the the
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
social policy and and so that that
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
concerned me in this particular case
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
although we had a have had a very nice
 
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
history with the commission where they
 
01:56:28.030 --> 01:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
have U behaved extremely reasonably and
 
01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
funded good programs and I'm on the
 
01:56:32.510 --> 01:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
commission so I'm at the risk of
 
01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
bragging about my participation uh I
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
didn't screw it up they still kept doing
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
good work and or we're expected to do
 
01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
good work but as the bill came in with
 
01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
the key thing of of having harm
 
01:56:49.550 --> 01:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
reduction added as an explicit uh new
 
01:56:54.149 --> 01:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
term of art um uh I got to be concerned
 
01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:57.320 align:start position:0%
because uh I was paying attention to the
 
01:57:01.310 --> 01:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
National media and um and what I picked
 
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
up was that uh harm reduction was such a
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
flexible term with no back stop to it
 
01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
that um you could take pretty much any
 
01:57:14.830 --> 01:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
issue related to the social determinance
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%
of health and fund it under the title of
 
01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
harm reduction and so what would that
 
01:57:23.950 --> 01:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
include that would include education and
 
01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
access to it it would include economic
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
stability it would include Health Care
 
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
access it would include neighborhood and
 
01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
built environment it it would include
 
01:57:38.830 --> 01:57:38.840 align:start position:0%
social and Community context and so you
 
01:57:42.109 --> 01:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
could go almost anywhere with something
 
01:57:45.229 --> 01:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
and label it harm reduction and the the
 
01:57:47.589 --> 01:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
legislature would basically be out of
 
01:57:51.390 --> 01:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
the loop so significant social policy
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
could become
 
01:57:56.510 --> 01:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh practice in New Hampshire without the
 
01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
the representatives of the of the people
 
01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
really being involved and so am I
 
01:58:05.910 --> 01:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
fear-mongering well uh if you look at
 
01:58:08.109 --> 01:58:08.119 align:start position:0%
Portland Seattle Minneapolis and New
 
01:58:10.830 --> 01:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
York City what you'll see is under the
 
01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
term harm reduction uh in um I think it
 
01:58:18.069 --> 01:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
was Portland where U the the homeless
 
01:58:20.270 --> 01:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
and drug addicted who they were mostly
 
01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
drug addicted were hanging out in front
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
of all the retail downtown and the mayor
 
01:58:28.229 --> 01:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
said this is killing our tax base we
 
01:58:30.830 --> 01:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
have to relocate these people she was
 
01:58:33.069 --> 01:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
stopped in doing that because of a
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that uh said that under the uh
 
01:58:40.589 --> 01:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
the Oregon law um harm reduction had to
 
01:58:42.990 --> 01:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
be considered and that by moving the
 
01:58:46.069 --> 01:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
loiterers out of where they were staying
 
01:58:48.189 --> 01:58:48.199 align:start position:0%
that that would cause harm and the
 
01:58:50.750 --> 01:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
government should not be inflicting harm
 
01:58:52.830 --> 01:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
so this was an issue where where there
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
was this tradeoff between how do we
 
01:58:58.430 --> 01:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
protect the health concerns that we have
 
01:59:01.629 --> 01:59:01.639 align:start position:0%
for uh the addicted and balance it
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
against the societal needs and
 
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
obligations to make sure that we overall
 
01:59:08.669 --> 01:59:08.679 align:start position:0%
have a healthy environment staying in
 
01:59:12.069 --> 01:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
front of I think the retail is probably
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
as good an example as you're going to
 
01:59:17.069 --> 01:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
find of this tradeoff between taking
 
01:59:18.990 --> 01:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
care of the individual harm reduction
 
01:59:21.189 --> 01:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
and making sure that you know we have
 
01:59:24.149 --> 01:59:24.159 align:start position:0%
the societal interests of tax collection
 
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
which funds all of this stuff so so
 
01:59:30.149 --> 01:59:30.159 align:start position:0%
there needed to be a balance there um in
 
01:59:32.350 --> 01:59:32.360 align:start position:0%
uh New York City they uh were having
 
01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
vending machines proposed that would be
 
01:59:37.310 --> 01:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
free and you could pull out any number
 
01:59:39.149 --> 01:59:39.159 align:start position:0%
of things to help with harm reduction
 
01:59:41.790 --> 01:59:41.800 align:start position:0%
one of them were new crack pipes now
 
01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
that may be a good idea you know but I
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
think it's a legislative idea I don't
 
01:59:48.990 --> 01:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
think a group of people appointed to a
 
01:59:51.189 --> 01:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
board who are delegated the authority to
 
01:59:53.910 --> 01:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
spend State money money should be able
 
01:59:58.350 --> 01:59:58.360 align:start position:0%
to uh just go ahead and Implement new uh
 
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
um uh serious State uh policy without uh
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
a check of the legislature and then of
 
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
course housing uh keeps coming up as
 
02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
something you know every attic needs a
 
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
place to sleep so so so that's always an
 
02:00:16.709 --> 02:00:16.719 align:start position:0%
issue and I'm I'm so sorry I I I I I can
 
02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
wrap it up but I think I do need two
 
02:00:21.550 --> 02:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
more minutes Mr chair sorry and I'll try
 
02:00:24.430 --> 02:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
not to your time Qui possible please uh
 
02:00:26.790 --> 02:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank thank you sir okay so even just
 
02:00:28.470 --> 02:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
this week in New Hampshire let's bring
 
02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
it home one of uh our our more
 
02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:34.719 align:start position:0%
well-known representatives in a public
 
02:00:39.390 --> 02:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
discussion about um Sanctuary status uh
 
02:00:42.109 --> 02:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
you know made the point that our policy
 
02:00:45.350 --> 02:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
on Sanctuary status ought to be viewed
 
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
as a an aspect of our harm reduction
 
02:00:51.229 --> 02:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
programs and so this this communicates
 
02:00:54.870 --> 02:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
the broader point that creating the term
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
harm reduction is could potentially be
 
02:01:01.709 --> 02:01:01.719 align:start position:0%
this endless uh possibility of anything
 
02:01:04.470 --> 02:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
that could be defined under the term and
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
since we're delegating tremendous money
 
02:01:09.629 --> 02:01:09.639 align:start position:0%
Authority the idea was let's go ahead
 
02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
and and have a reasonable boundary
 
02:01:14.430 --> 02:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
around the kinds of things that we think
 
02:01:16.510 --> 02:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
are are legitimate harm reduction
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
policies they' found their way
 
02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
specifically into the statute um and say
 
02:01:23.790 --> 02:01:23.800 align:start position:0%
you know go forth and do these things
 
02:01:25.950 --> 02:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
but if you want to do something outside
 
02:01:28.589 --> 02:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
this this boundary uh you're going to
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
need to come and get um legislative
 
02:01:34.750 --> 02:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
support and that's why you see this uh
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
ambiguous term many people will think
 
02:01:40.229 --> 02:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
it's ambiguous where uh there's a a need
 
02:01:44.310 --> 02:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
to uh balance societal and individual
 
02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
harm um if you were a systems manager
 
02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
you would look at this the way systems
 
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
manag ERS look at the concept of
 
02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:55.830 align:start position:0%
manag ERS look at the concept of
subsystem

02:01:55.830 --> 02:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
subsystem
 
02:01:59.189 --> 02:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
optimization and subsystem optimization
 
02:02:02.550 --> 02:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
is if as you're building and designing
 
02:02:04.669 --> 02:02:04.679 align:start position:0%
organizations and processes and
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
procedures if you focus on
 
02:02:10.109 --> 02:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
maximizing the the potential and
 
02:02:12.390 --> 02:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
capability of one component of the
 
02:02:15.310 --> 02:02:15.320 align:start position:0%
system you can actually do harm to the
 
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
entire system because you've
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
overemphasized the one component and so
 
02:02:24.510 --> 02:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
sub system optimization is is a a
 
02:02:27.870 --> 02:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
warning to systems thinkers that you
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
have to maintain a balance of the system
 
02:02:33.149 --> 02:02:33.159 align:start position:0%
and that if you ever see yourself like
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
overemphasizing uh one component of it
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
then you're probably doing harm to the
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
overall system that's two minutes is
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
almost done yeah yeah um and um and all
 
02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
of the people that are going to be
 
02:02:48.189 --> 02:02:48.199 align:start position:0%
involved in this once we let it go um
 
02:02:51.870 --> 02:02:51.880 align:start position:0%
are are good people with good intent but
 
02:02:54.270 --> 02:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
in general they have a very specific
 
02:02:58.430 --> 02:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
focus on the individual and we just want
 
02:03:02.069 --> 02:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
I think we we we want them to push that
 
02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
canoe out into the lake understanding
 
02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
that it's not just the individual they
 
02:03:11.109 --> 02:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
have to be careful and cautious about um
 
02:03:13.149 --> 02:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
any impact it may have to the broader
 
02:03:16.350 --> 02:03:16.360 align:start position:0%
community and Society so uh I could I
 
02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
could say more this is such a great
 
02:03:21.790 --> 02:03:21.800 align:start position:0%
topic but I'll shut up any questions for
 
02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:23.750 align:start position:0%
topic but I'll shut up any questions for
representative

02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
Edwards I'm saying to say you covered it
 
02:03:28.910 --> 02:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
so well we have no questions well I
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
followed uh the experts um both and I
 
02:03:33.910 --> 02:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
didn't even get a chance to thank them
 
02:03:35.550 --> 02:03:35.560 align:start position:0%
they were just so great with the
 
02:03:37.750 --> 02:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
collegiality and they could have been
 
02:03:40.069 --> 02:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
offended and mad at me but we had some
 
02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
really great conversations and I think
 
02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
it's an example of of of of doing
 
02:03:47.790 --> 02:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan legislation not bipartisan
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:55.709 --> 02:03:55.719 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Chief
 
02:03:58.229 --> 02:03:58.239 align:start position:0%

02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
Police I believe it's the New Hampshire
 
02:04:02.669 --> 02:04:02.679 align:start position:0%
State Police no I'm from the Alexandria
 
02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:11.470 --> 02:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
okay please please put your microphone

morning uh chairman McDonald and members

of the committee thank you very much for
 
02:04:22.109 --> 02:04:22.119 align:start position:0%
having me to speak to this bill my name
 
02:04:23.790 --> 02:04:23.800 align:start position:0%
is Dave suckling I've been a police
 
02:04:25.950 --> 02:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
officer for 14 years and I've been a
 
02:04:28.709 --> 02:04:28.719 align:start position:0%
chief of police for uh 12 of those years
 
02:04:30.189 --> 02:04:30.199 align:start position:0%
I'm currently the chief of police in
 
02:04:33.390 --> 02:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
alexand at the Alexandria PD and I work
 
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
with our Laconia rural community opioid
 
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
response Consortium aror for short which
 
02:04:40.549 --> 02:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
is federally funded program and I
 
02:04:42.069 --> 02:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
present annually at the National
 
02:04:44.350 --> 02:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
Conference in DC about police
 
02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
integration and Community recovery
 
02:04:48.149 --> 02:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
efforts and I'm also here to support the
 
02:04:49.990 --> 02:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Chiefs of Police
 
02:04:52.069 --> 02:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
Association and I'm proud to say that we
 
02:04:54.990 --> 02:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
support this Bel um small towns such as
 
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
ours are not without our own drug rated
 
02:04:59.589 --> 02:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
challenges as I'm sure you all know in
 
02:05:02.390 --> 02:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
2018 I was present in an overdose death
 
02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
that changed my life and my approach to
 
02:05:07.109 --> 02:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
policing forever a young man in our
 
02:05:09.270 --> 02:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
community was late for work and his
 
02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
parents had gone into his room to make
 
02:05:12.549 --> 02:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
sure he was awake and instead of awake
 
02:05:14.510 --> 02:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
they found their son Dead with a bag of
 
02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
powder beside him he had been a
 
02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
meaningful recovery for several
 
02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:22.719 align:start position:0%
years since then Alex Andria PD has
 
02:05:25.149 --> 02:05:25.159 align:start position:0%
distributed hundreds of doses of Naran
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
throughout our community and personally
 
02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
I've taken around 12 people uh to
 
02:05:31.669 --> 02:05:31.679 align:start position:0%
recovery placements last year and this
 
02:05:34.430 --> 02:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
is all possible through Community um
 
02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with recovery agencies and
 
02:05:39.750 --> 02:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
since then we haven't had a documented
 
02:05:42.589 --> 02:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
overdose in Alexandria since we started
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
Distributing n oxone in our town and we
 
02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
acutely learned that dead people don't
 
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
heal which has turned into a bit of a
 
02:05:52.109 --> 02:05:52.119 align:start position:0%
battle cray and AR fits and lo and
 
02:05:54.149 --> 02:05:54.159 align:start position:0%
behold what we were doing was harm
 
02:05:56.430 --> 02:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
reduction we just didn't know what it
 
02:05:58.669 --> 02:05:58.679 align:start position:0%
was uh we just thought we were saving
 
02:05:58.679 --> 02:06:00.629 align:start position:0%
was uh we just thought we were saving
people's

02:06:00.629 --> 02:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
people's
 
02:06:03.629 --> 02:06:03.639 align:start position:0%
lives these efforts haven't been uh in
 
02:06:06.069 --> 02:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
Lee of law enforcement
 
02:06:08.589 --> 02:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
efforts and uh we found that people are
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
often willing to uh explore recovery
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
efforts uh post arrest while in our
 
02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
booking room and we've taken several
 
02:06:17.709 --> 02:06:17.719 align:start position:0%
people to recovery from our booking room
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh for long-term meaningful recovery
 
02:06:22.589 --> 02:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
which we're insanely proud of of uh
 
02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
police New Hampshire have a unique
 
02:06:26.109 --> 02:06:26.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk with people
 
02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
suffering from substance use disorder
 
02:06:30.310 --> 02:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
and save lives in the state hence
 
02:06:33.069 --> 02:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
increasing police legitimacy and more
 
02:06:35.669 --> 02:06:35.679 align:start position:0%
meaningful interactions with the public
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh and this bill will help bridge the
 
02:06:39.549 --> 02:06:39.559 align:start position:0%
gap between uh law enforcement and
 
02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
Recovery agencies uh New Hampshire
 
02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
Chiefs of police would welcome the
 
02:06:44.790 --> 02:06:44.800 align:start position:0%

question so uh uh representative Edwards
 
02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh gave a scenario when certain um
 
02:08:41.910 --> 02:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
policy decisions are being
 
02:08:45.950 --> 02:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
challenged in the court uh on the basis
 
02:08:49.910 --> 02:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
of definition of h reduction have you
 
02:08:52.189 --> 02:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
seen anything like
 
02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
that in New Hampshire
 
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
and what are your thoughts on this bill
 
02:08:58.750 --> 02:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
in regards
 
02:08:58.760 --> 02:09:00.310 align:start position:0%
in regards
to

02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
um uh addressing
 
02:09:06.189 --> 02:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
situations like that challenges in
 
02:09:10.350 --> 02:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
court yes so the current um programs
 
02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
that we are implementing in New
 
02:09:14.030 --> 02:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in this space really are
 
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
within our prevention treatment and
 
02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
Recovery Support Services we did work
 
02:09:21.149 --> 02:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
closely with sponsors of the bill and in
 
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
the a study committee on harm reduction
 
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
to help with um crafting any of this so
 
02:09:28.510 --> 02:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
I believe that the work that we're doing
 
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
today as many others noted is around
 
02:09:34.109 --> 02:09:34.119 align:start position:0%
saving lives and helping people access
 
02:09:36.549 --> 02:09:36.559 align:start position:0%
care to protect our communities I don't
 
02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
think that anything that we have
 
02:09:40.549 --> 02:09:40.559 align:start position:0%
operating in New Hampshire would is
 
02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
necessarily Up For Debate or would come
 
02:09:46.709 --> 02:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
up in in that way follow up uh thank you
 
02:09:49.950 --> 02:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
for allowing me follow up so reading Z
 
02:09:53.669 --> 02:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
bill I think uh it's mostly a positive
 
02:09:57.310 --> 02:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
definitions what hum reduction is but I
 
02:10:00.109 --> 02:10:00.119 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily see negative
 
02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
definition what hum reduction is not do
 
02:10:05.790 --> 02:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
you think we need to include some
 
02:10:10.109 --> 02:10:10.119 align:start position:0%
negative definitions uh to address like
 
02:10:10.119 --> 02:10:12.030 align:start position:0%
negative definitions uh to address like
Society

02:10:12.030 --> 02:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
Society
 
02:10:16.189 --> 02:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
issues so we don't in the same statute
 
02:10:18.629 --> 02:10:18.639 align:start position:0%
Define prevention treatment or recovery
 
02:10:20.750 --> 02:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
which are all the other places sort of
 
02:10:23.830 --> 02:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
buckets and which we do this work so in
 
02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
the field in uh I think we have an
 
02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
understanding of what these definitions
 
02:10:33.069 --> 02:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
mean and are able to operate based on
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
the best practices in the field and
 
02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
we're able to also make um changes
 
02:10:42.109 --> 02:10:42.119 align:start position:0%
quickly if the on the ground in
 
02:10:43.709 --> 02:10:43.719 align:start position:0%
collaboration with law enforcement and
 
02:10:45.629 --> 02:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and our health departments
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
and Regional public health networks in
 
02:10:50.109 --> 02:10:50.119 align:start position:0%
order to respond to crises or what's
 
02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
happening in our environment
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
and I think part of not needing a
 
02:10:55.790 --> 02:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
definition for prevention treatment and
 
02:10:57.189 --> 02:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
Recovery helps us to have that
 
02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility and be nimble so overly
 
02:11:02.549 --> 02:11:02.559 align:start position:0%
defining how we respond especially when
 
02:11:05.470 --> 02:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
we have major crisis ongoing in the
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
state could be potentially problematic I
 
02:11:10.350 --> 02:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
think we can trust the the work of the
 
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
governor's commission and those that
 
02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:15.270 align:start position:0%
governor's commission and those that
they're

02:11:15.270 --> 02:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:19.149 --> 02:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
much I have no one else signed up to
 
02:11:30.470 --> 02:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
testify on h73 does anyone else wish to
 
02:11:32.669 --> 02:11:32.679 align:start position:0%
testify I'm seeing no one so I'm am
 
02:11:34.589 --> 02:11:34.599 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing on HB
 
02:11:37.549 --> 02:11:37.559 align:start position:0%
73 our next hearing is going to be on
 
02:11:41.310 --> 02:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
hb994 FN at 1 pm we'll be in recess
 
02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:50.229 align:start position:0%

02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:50.239 --> 02:12:20.149 align:start position:0%
 
then

02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:20.159 --> 02:12:50.109 align:start position:0%

bipartisan testimony that you'll be here

ing um circumcision is the uh cutting of

the for skin of the penis in other words
 
03:37:56.910 --> 03:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
uh removing erogenous tissue and
 
03:37:58.830 --> 03:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
replacing it with scar
 
03:38:02.150 --> 03:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
tissue uh we seek to U Save the cost on
 
03:38:05.670 --> 03:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
this and also on the botched
 
03:38:07.870 --> 03:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
circumcisions uh circumcision is
 
03:38:07.880 --> 03:38:09.510 align:start position:0%
circumcisions uh circumcision is
medically

03:38:09.510 --> 03:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
medically
 
03:38:13.030 --> 03:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
unnecessary I myself am proof of that as
 
03:38:15.950 --> 03:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
I am intact along with 90% of the male
 
03:38:17.830 --> 03:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
population on the
 
03:38:21.349 --> 03:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
planet uh who have no problems being
 
03:38:24.710 --> 03:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
intact so far 16 states have passed
 
03:38:24.720 --> 03:38:25.910 align:start position:0%
intact so far 16 states have passed
similar

03:38:25.910 --> 03:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
similar
 
03:38:28.269 --> 03:38:28.279 align:start position:0%
legislation the rate of circumcision in
 
03:38:30.950 --> 03:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
the country is down to
 
03:38:34.030 --> 03:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
50% other countries that have had
 
03:38:37.550 --> 03:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
circumcision but got rid of it are
 
03:38:40.750 --> 03:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
England and Canada when they went to a
 
03:38:43.269 --> 03:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
socialized medicine
 
03:38:45.670 --> 03:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
system uh in Canada another contrib in
 
03:38:48.229 --> 03:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
Factor may have been that a child lost
 
03:38:52.110 --> 03:38:52.120 align:start position:0%
his penis to a botched circumcision very
 
03:38:56.990 --> 03:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
tragic uh person was raised as as a uh
 
03:39:00.189 --> 03:39:00.199 align:start position:0%
girl and then later committed
 
03:39:02.309 --> 03:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
suicide now I would like to draw a
 
03:39:05.429 --> 03:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
distinction between uh religious
 
03:39:09.110 --> 03:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
circumcision and secular circumcision
 
03:39:12.030 --> 03:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
and how it's related to harm I'm going
 
03:39:15.990 --> 03:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
to quote from a rabbi rabbis perform
 
03:39:18.950 --> 03:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
circumcision from a documentary uh
 
03:39:21.189 --> 03:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
called cut slice slicing through the
 
03:39:24.550 --> 03:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
midst of circumcision it's a rabbi uh
 
03:39:28.630 --> 03:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
Hershey warsh he's brutally honest here
 
03:39:33.309 --> 03:39:33.319 align:start position:0%
he says it's painful it's abusive it's
 
03:39:35.910 --> 03:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
traumatic and if anyone not in the
 
03:39:38.710 --> 03:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
Covenant does it I think they should be
 
03:39:39.550 --> 03:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
put in
 
03:39:42.670 --> 03:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
prison I don't think anybody has an
 
03:39:46.110 --> 03:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
excuse for mutilating a child now we
 
03:39:47.469 --> 03:39:47.479 align:start position:0%
have to draw the
 
03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
religious uh ethics here it's in the
 
03:39:54.510 --> 03:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
Covenant versus the secular ethics which
 
03:39:56.510 --> 03:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
is what we're supposed to be doing we're
 
03:40:00.229 --> 03:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
in a secular secular category now how
 
03:40:03.389 --> 03:40:03.399 align:start position:0%
did circumcision become a secular thing
 
03:40:07.070 --> 03:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
I handed that the history out but in a
 
03:40:09.990 --> 03:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
nutshell um during the late
 
03:40:13.110 --> 03:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
1800s when medicine was more snake oil
 
03:40:14.150 --> 03:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
and less
 
03:40:16.790 --> 03:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
science there there are
 
03:40:20.150 --> 03:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
puritanical uh prudish quacks promoting
 
03:40:23.950 --> 03:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
circumcision and they outright uh say it
 
03:40:27.309 --> 03:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
it's to diminish sexual
 
03:40:30.950 --> 03:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
pleasure it cures
 
03:40:32.910 --> 03:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
nothing even though there are many
 
03:40:34.510 --> 03:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
claims that it
 
03:40:38.070 --> 03:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
does uh it's a cure in search of a
 
03:40:40.990 --> 03:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
disease and it's backwards that's
 
03:40:44.070 --> 03:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
backwards science there's a lot of bogus
 
03:40:47.110 --> 03:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
funding uh generally by people who have
 
03:40:49.990 --> 03:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
been circumcised and want to get the
 
03:40:51.590 --> 03:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
results that they want to get because
 
03:40:54.229 --> 03:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
they're funding the the studies and I
 
03:40:56.950 --> 03:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
find it very strange um people are
 
03:40:59.389 --> 03:40:59.399 align:start position:0%
missing a body part extoling the virtues
 
03:41:02.309 --> 03:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
of missing that body part and you know I
 
03:41:03.550 --> 03:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
ask them about and they say oh I know
 
03:41:07.150 --> 03:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
what I'm missing I think how no you
 
03:41:09.150 --> 03:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
can't you don't have that
 
03:41:12.229 --> 03:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
part you can't feel what you don't have
 
03:41:15.790 --> 03:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
that is epistemologically impossible
 
03:41:17.670 --> 03:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
you've never felt the natural normal
 
03:41:20.030 --> 03:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
function of your penis you have no
 
03:41:24.389 --> 03:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:27.070 --> 03:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
intended it's it's like the colorblind
 
03:41:30.469 --> 03:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
person touting the merits of being
 
03:41:34.469 --> 03:41:34.479 align:start position:0%
Colorblind on and by the way um also in
 
03:41:37.510 --> 03:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
the with regards to female circumcision
 
03:41:39.750 --> 03:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing there are women who
 
03:41:41.870 --> 03:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
have been had female circumcision
 
03:41:44.429 --> 03:41:44.439 align:start position:0%
performed on them in some societies and
 
03:41:46.710 --> 03:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
they want to do it to their
 
03:41:49.590 --> 03:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
girls they have no standing there too
 
03:41:51.990 --> 03:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
total color blindness on the
 
03:41:54.269 --> 03:41:54.279 align:start position:0%
issue well so so to
 
03:41:57.830 --> 03:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
conclude I would ask the people who are
 
03:42:01.189 --> 03:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
promoting circumcision tell me again why
 
03:42:05.070 --> 03:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
I should have had highly innervated
 
03:42:08.550 --> 03:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
aerogenous tissue cut off of my body or
 
03:42:09.950 --> 03:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
my children's
 
03:42:12.950 --> 03:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
body for Medicaid to pay for
 
03:42:16.309 --> 03:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
circumcision is an immoral harmful
 
03:42:22.349 --> 03:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:25.269 --> 03:42:25.279 align:start position:0%
autonomy and I think with
 
03:42:29.870 --> 03:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
that I'll finish up oh one other thing
 
03:42:32.269 --> 03:42:32.279 align:start position:0%
last time when I put in some testimony I
 
03:42:34.309 --> 03:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
quoted from various people who had been
 
03:42:36.510 --> 03:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
harmed from circumcision some of them
 
03:42:39.870 --> 03:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
were celebrities and I found it quite
 
03:42:41.590 --> 03:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
offensive how the other side mockingly
 
03:42:45.630 --> 03:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
referred to them it's very offensive to
 
03:42:47.110 --> 03:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
mockingly refer to people who have been
 
03:42:48.830 --> 03:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
harmed by circumcision just because some
 
03:42:50.630 --> 03:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
of them were
 
03:42:53.349 --> 03:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
Comedians and with that if anybody has
 
03:42:57.309 --> 03:42:57.319 align:start position:0%
any questions I have I guess I've become
 
03:43:00.309 --> 03:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
a expert on this
 
03:43:00.319 --> 03:43:02.070 align:start position:0%
a expert on this
topic

03:43:02.070 --> 03:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
topic
 
03:43:06.630 --> 03:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:10.389 --> 03:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
questions I'm oh representative Woods uh
 
03:43:11.550 --> 03:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:43:14.510 --> 03:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um was there any
 
03:43:16.389 --> 03:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
reason your microphone a little closer
 
03:43:18.990 --> 03:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
representative Woods I'm having a little
 
03:43:21.790 --> 03:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
heing thank you um was there any
 
03:43:24.229 --> 03:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
particular reason I mean I can imagine a
 
03:43:27.389 --> 03:43:27.399 align:start position:0%
few but why did you focus just on
 
03:43:29.870 --> 03:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid well
 
03:43:33.910 --> 03:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
um one of one of the ways to save I
 
03:43:37.189 --> 03:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
guess save the money and also on B
 
03:43:37.199 --> 03:43:38.990 align:start position:0%
guess save the money and also on B
circumcisions

03:43:38.990 --> 03:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
circumcisions
 
03:43:42.990 --> 03:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
um the issue as far as on the religious
 
03:43:45.189 --> 03:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
side that's something that they have to
 
03:43:46.429 --> 03:43:46.439 align:start position:0%
within their
 
03:43:50.630 --> 03:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
Community um like Jewish folks have also
 
03:43:51.990 --> 03:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
moved to something that's called Brit
 
03:43:56.670 --> 03:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
Shalom where they don't do cutting so
 
03:43:59.630 --> 03:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
um basically this is where we need to
 
03:44:03.630 --> 03:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
start with public awareness by cutting
 
03:44:07.710 --> 03:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:10.149 --> 03:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
level other
 
03:44:12.389 --> 03:44:12.399 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:44:15.269 --> 03:44:15.279 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:44:18.070 --> 03:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh does the State
 
03:44:21.870 --> 03:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid plan covers female circumcision
 
03:44:24.189 --> 03:44:24.199 align:start position:0%
uh no in fact there's a law that bans
 
03:44:27.110 --> 03:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
you can't even take a pin prick to
 
03:44:30.870 --> 03:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
anything on a woman oh that reminds me I
 
03:44:33.750 --> 03:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
have some other things here there is a
 
03:44:35.469 --> 03:44:35.479 align:start position:0%
testimony that you guys got but I
 
03:44:39.189 --> 03:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
printed it out from an attorney uh Eric
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
Clopper uh he's going to be uh suing all
 
03:44:45.070 --> 03:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
the states for equal protection so I'll
 
03:44:47.590 --> 03:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
hand this out too um he and he's going
 
03:44:49.590 --> 03:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
to be coming around to New Hampshire too
 
03:44:51.229 --> 03:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
maybe we could preemptively do something
 
03:44:53.229 --> 03:44:53.239 align:start position:0%
about this but
 
03:44:55.910 --> 03:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
anyway other questions representative
 
03:44:58.149 --> 03:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
03:45:00.510 --> 03:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um there was a
 
03:45:02.790 --> 03:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
statement somewhere that the state would
 
03:45:05.070 --> 03:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
save something like $100,000 I think
 
03:45:06.990 --> 03:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
that was a FIS note or something yeah I
 
03:45:09.189 --> 03:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
believe is breakdown for that where that
 
03:45:11.790 --> 03:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
comes from it's hard to break it down
 
03:45:15.349 --> 03:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
but uh the um we got it from Department
 
03:45:18.750 --> 03:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
of Revenue I believe um and there's also
 
03:45:20.790 --> 03:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
extra numbers that and and I can send it
 
03:45:24.189 --> 03:45:24.199 align:start position:0%
out to you in an email uh where it the
 
03:45:26.510 --> 03:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
Box circumcisions cost just as much as
 
03:45:29.950 --> 03:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
the initial cost maybe even more to do
 
03:45:29.960 --> 03:45:30.790 align:start position:0%
the initial cost maybe even more to do
the

03:45:30.790 --> 03:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:45:32.910 --> 03:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
repairs but uh I'll have to get those
 
03:45:35.309 --> 03:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
numbers to you and and the re if I can
 
03:45:38.349 --> 03:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
clarify sorry yeah fell the reason why I
 
03:45:39.750 --> 03:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
bring it up is I I'm sure there's an
 
03:45:41.710 --> 03:45:41.720 align:start position:0%
administrative cost and then a a
 
03:45:43.790 --> 03:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursement cost but I mean all the
 
03:45:45.550 --> 03:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
providers that I know that do this say
 
03:45:47.750 --> 03:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
they don't make much money doing it you
 
03:45:50.110 --> 03:45:50.120 align:start position:0%
know it's like 20 30 bucks tops you know
 
03:45:51.550 --> 03:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
so that's why I was struck that the
 
03:45:53.950 --> 03:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
number was so big well the fact that it
 
03:45:55.590 --> 03:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
exists in that chap that administrators
 
03:45:57.550 --> 03:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
and everybody all bureaucrats to dealing
 
03:46:00.030 --> 03:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
with it cost money if you just like
 
03:46:01.269 --> 03:46:01.279 align:start position:0%
strike it
 
03:46:04.990 --> 03:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
from the process you're going to
 
03:46:08.110 --> 03:46:08.120 align:start position:0%
save no matter
 
03:46:11.149 --> 03:46:11.159 align:start position:0%
what other
 
03:46:14.070 --> 03:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
questions saying none okay thank you
 
03:46:22.950 --> 03:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:24.269 --> 03:46:24.279 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
03:46:25.710 --> 03:46:25.720 align:start position:0%
representative Jonah
 
03:46:30.030 --> 03:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:32.870 --> 03:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
33 thank you Mr chair friends and
 
03:46:35.110 --> 03:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the house Health and Human
 
03:46:36.550 --> 03:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
Services committee my name is
 
03:46:38.870 --> 03:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative Jonah oan wheeler I
 
03:46:41.870 --> 03:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of petero and Sharon
 
03:46:44.030 --> 03:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
I'm here today just to quickly say that
 
03:46:45.429 --> 03:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
I don't support
 
03:46:48.830 --> 03:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
State sanctioned circumcision plain and
 
03:46:51.870 --> 03:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
simple uh it really isn't about cost
 
03:46:53.710 --> 03:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
savings although it's always good to
 
03:46:55.349 --> 03:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
save money where we can for me it's
 
03:46:58.309 --> 03:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
about this is an elective procedure that
 
03:46:58.319 --> 03:47:00.309 align:start position:0%
about this is an elective procedure that
is

03:47:00.309 --> 03:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:47:03.429 --> 03:47:03.439 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think as beneficial as is
 
03:47:06.269 --> 03:47:06.279 align:start position:0%
purported by supporters of circumcision
 
03:47:09.830 --> 03:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
and it is elective and Medicaid services
 
03:47:12.590 --> 03:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't in my opinion cover such
 
03:47:17.309 --> 03:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
elective procedures so I'm happy to take
 
03:47:19.510 --> 03:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
any questions but that's really all I'm
 
03:47:24.110 --> 03:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
here to say I yeah thank you Mr chairman
 
03:47:27.469 --> 03:47:27.479 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative
 
03:47:29.750 --> 03:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
Woods thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
03:47:32.030 --> 03:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question absolutely I just
 
03:47:34.790 --> 03:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
need two questions clarification you
 
03:47:36.910 --> 03:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
said it's elective and therefore
 
03:47:39.429 --> 03:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be covered I that's kind of a
 
03:47:42.870 --> 03:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
confusing statement could you clarify
 
03:47:45.349 --> 03:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
that well you would know better than I
 
03:47:47.389 --> 03:47:47.399 align:start position:0%
as a doctor I
 
03:47:50.670 --> 03:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that uh circumcision
 
03:47:52.030 --> 03:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
should be covered by Medicaid maybe
 
03:47:53.469 --> 03:47:53.479 align:start position:0%
that's what I should have said instead
 
03:47:55.309 --> 03:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
of the word elective I mean I have a
 
03:47:58.510 --> 03:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
total hip which is an elective
 
03:48:00.870 --> 03:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
procedure but that was
 
03:48:03.030 --> 03:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
covered like I just said I'll change
 
03:48:05.229 --> 03:48:05.239 align:start position:0%
what I said to circumcision shouldn't be
 
03:48:10.510 --> 03:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
covered to Medicaid follow follow up um
 
03:48:13.229 --> 03:48:13.239 align:start position:0%
in medicine we try and emphasize the
 
03:48:15.269 --> 03:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
relationship between the phys phys and
 
03:48:15.279 --> 03:48:16.110 align:start position:0%
relationship between the phys phys and
the

03:48:16.110 --> 03:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:48:19.590 --> 03:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
patient um to what extent should that be
 
03:48:22.550 --> 03:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
considered in in this
 
03:48:27.389 --> 03:48:27.399 align:start position:0%
venue I think that the Medicaid services
 
03:48:29.910 --> 03:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
here you know we're not Banning
 
03:48:32.030 --> 03:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
circumcision just means that it's not
 
03:48:35.750 --> 03:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
funded by the state and uh if the doctor
 
03:48:36.790 --> 03:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
and the patient want to have a
 
03:48:38.229 --> 03:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
conversation about cutting the tip of
 
03:48:40.910 --> 03:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
the penis off of their newborn baby then
 
03:48:42.990 --> 03:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
they're absolutely able to have that
 
03:48:45.750 --> 03:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
conversation but to me the procedure
 
03:48:47.950 --> 03:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
should be a lot more researched studied
 
03:48:50.389 --> 03:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
by those parents and with informed
 
03:48:52.830 --> 03:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
consent proper informed consent I don't
 
03:48:55.830 --> 03:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
think a parent regardless of or uh
 
03:48:57.990 --> 03:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
irrespective of their religious re views
 
03:49:00.030 --> 03:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
would would elect to have this procedure
 
03:49:02.910 --> 03:49:02.920 align:start position:0%

my name is Paige Bosman I am a
 
03:49:50.469 --> 03:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
representative from Hillsboro 3 I
 
03:49:53.990 --> 03:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
represent NASA's Ward 4 I am oh let me
 
03:49:55.269 --> 03:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
get my
 
03:49:58.550 --> 03:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
notes I am also a registered nurse and I
 
03:50:00.590 --> 03:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
am certified in maternal mental health
 
03:50:02.590 --> 03:50:02.600 align:start position:0%
from the only certifying board in this
 
03:50:05.429 --> 03:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
country um I have been working for 15
 
03:50:07.389 --> 03:50:07.399 align:start position:0%
years in both Maternal Child Health as
 
03:50:10.790 --> 03:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
well as Health Equity and uh mental
 
03:50:13.309 --> 03:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
health within the uh maternal
 
03:50:17.429 --> 03:50:17.439 align:start position:0%
space I um as of even just six months
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
ago I was the nurse who talks to the
 
03:50:22.990 --> 03:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
patients about the education around this
 
03:50:24.750 --> 03:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm the one that would assist the
 
03:50:27.149 --> 03:50:27.159 align:start position:0%
physicians in the circumcisions and I I
 
03:50:30.670 --> 03:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
did uh I did speak to this last year um
 
03:50:34.110 --> 03:50:34.120 align:start position:0%
I am here because as written or excuse
 
03:50:37.870 --> 03:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
me I I am uh opposed to this bill for
 
03:50:40.870 --> 03:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
some very specific reason so I would
 
03:50:43.229 --> 03:50:43.239 align:start position:0%
like to just kind of put out there um
 
03:50:45.189 --> 03:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
you may hear testimony
 
03:50:47.349 --> 03:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh to to the opposite of this but
 
03:50:51.070 --> 03:50:51.080 align:start position:0%
circumcision is well um uh it is well
 
03:50:52.790 --> 03:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
accepted that it is not medically
 
03:50:55.389 --> 03:50:55.399 align:start position:0%
necessary so we we should start from
 
03:50:57.110 --> 03:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
that position the American Academy of
 
03:50:59.229 --> 03:50:59.239 align:start position:0%
Pediatricians for many years now maybe 5
 
03:51:01.670 --> 03:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
to 10 um have said that it is not
 
03:51:04.550 --> 03:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
medically necessary now I have been an
 
03:51:07.149 --> 03:51:07.159 align:start position:0%
educator for 15 I teach newborn care I
 
03:51:09.229 --> 03:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
have been teaching parents that for 15
 
03:51:12.870 --> 03:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
years I am uh in agreement with most of
 
03:51:14.830 --> 03:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
the anti-circumcision information that
 
03:51:18.550 --> 03:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
you will hear today um and I agree that
 
03:51:20.790 --> 03:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
we should significantly decrease that I
 
03:51:23.550 --> 03:51:23.560 align:start position:0%
do believe it is a body autonomy issue
 
03:51:27.510 --> 03:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
with that being said I do not believe
 
03:51:29.830 --> 03:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
that de that taking away Medicaid
 
03:51:32.189 --> 03:51:32.199 align:start position:0%
funding is the right way that we do that
 
03:51:34.750 --> 03:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
representative Woods as you said we in
 
03:51:36.950 --> 03:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
medicine prefer to work with our
 
03:51:39.030 --> 03:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
patients and meet them where they are
 
03:51:40.830 --> 03:51:40.840 align:start position:0%
nationally the rate of circumcision
 
03:51:44.149 --> 03:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
right now is about uh in the 60% while
 
03:51:46.149 --> 03:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it's
 
03:51:48.950 --> 03:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
76% most parents do not know that it's
 
03:51:51.830 --> 03:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
not medically necessary given that
 
03:51:56.070 --> 03:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
circumcision has very deep cultural and
 
03:51:58.990 --> 03:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
religious um Foundation right people
 
03:52:01.710 --> 03:52:01.720 align:start position:0%
have very deep belief systems about that
 
03:52:04.229 --> 03:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
I very much worry about just taking that
 
03:52:06.750 --> 03:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
away from them um by making it
 
03:52:10.309 --> 03:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
unavailable only to our lower income
 
03:52:14.630 --> 03:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
constituents um if circumcision is is
 
03:52:16.429 --> 03:52:16.439 align:start position:0%
everything and as terrible as we say it
 
03:52:18.349 --> 03:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
is I believe we should be banning it
 
03:52:21.149 --> 03:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
outright if we're not convinced that
 
03:52:24.070 --> 03:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's egregious enough to ban it outright
 
03:52:25.870 --> 03:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
then why do we think that it's okay to
 
03:52:28.710 --> 03:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
take it away in a discriminatory way
 
03:52:31.950 --> 03:52:31.960 align:start position:0%
just from a certain group of people my
 
03:52:35.950 --> 03:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be that we work on
 
03:52:37.550 --> 03:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
education although I'll tell you that in
 
03:52:39.710 --> 03:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
Maternal Child Health there's a lot of
 
03:52:41.070 --> 03:52:41.080 align:start position:0%
Education that doesn't get to the
 
03:52:44.110 --> 03:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
parents and we are working on that I
 
03:52:47.670 --> 03:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
work every day on that my final sentence
 
03:52:49.149 --> 03:52:49.159 align:start position:0%
I would recommend that instead of
 
03:52:51.790 --> 03:52:51.800 align:start position:0%
banning this that we find a way to
 
03:52:54.110 --> 03:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
improve the education in the state and
 
03:52:57.149 --> 03:52:57.159 align:start position:0%
then in a few years look at legislating
 
03:52:59.030 --> 03:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
how we might decrease it if we need to
 
03:53:00.990 --> 03:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
at that point thank you very much thank
 
03:53:04.510 --> 03:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
you any questions representative Nagel
 
03:53:06.229 --> 03:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
03:53:08.030 --> 03:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
my question I always struggle with this
 
03:53:10.110 --> 03:53:10.120 align:start position:0%
whole concept of medical necessity and
 
03:53:12.590 --> 03:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
electivity sure um I mean one of the
 
03:53:14.070 --> 03:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
reasons I think this bill is being
 
03:53:18.149 --> 03:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
pursued by some is to cut costs um and
 
03:53:20.389 --> 03:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
and and moving on from that when they
 
03:53:22.110 --> 03:53:22.120 align:start position:0%
tell me if I'm wrong but when they
 
03:53:25.309 --> 03:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
studied this in Florida and they removed
 
03:53:28.149 --> 03:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid reimbursement the the the
 
03:53:30.590 --> 03:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
cost of the system actually Rose because
 
03:53:33.870 --> 03:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
of the increased number of post neonatal
 
03:53:36.030 --> 03:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
or newborn circumcisions they had to do
 
03:53:38.229 --> 03:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
is that your experience or you know that
 
03:53:40.110 --> 03:53:40.120 align:start position:0%
actually brings up a really really
 
03:53:43.110 --> 03:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
really good point um I I'm not familiar
 
03:53:44.830 --> 03:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
with that what I can tell you you is
 
03:53:46.710 --> 03:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
that when people are not getting the
 
03:53:49.550 --> 03:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate education on how to care for
 
03:53:52.870 --> 03:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
an uncircumcised penis then we do see
 
03:53:55.710 --> 03:53:55.720 align:start position:0%
rates of infection go up so that's
 
03:53:57.750 --> 03:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
another reason that I think education is
 
03:53:59.750 --> 03:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
so important if we're just Banning it
 
03:54:01.910 --> 03:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
without providing the education we may
 
03:54:03.309 --> 03:54:03.319 align:start position:0%
or may not be actually improving
 
03:54:05.910 --> 03:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
outcomes or decreasing costs I do want
 
03:54:08.830 --> 03:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
to add that um I was looking at the bill
 
03:54:11.670 --> 03:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
and I saw in the fiscal note that that
 
03:54:13.750 --> 03:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
it was indetermined and that it was
 
03:54:17.910 --> 03:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
either 100 100,000 increase or decrease
 
03:54:19.590 --> 03:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
in cost so we actually don't know that
 
03:54:21.030 --> 03:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
in the next few years this would
 
03:54:23.229 --> 03:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
decrease cost it could actually increase
 
03:54:26.070 --> 03:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
it by $100,000 according to the note
 
03:54:28.269 --> 03:54:28.279 align:start position:0%
thank you I would also like to say that
 
03:54:32.269 --> 03:54:32.279 align:start position:0%
the um online opposition to this out of
 
03:54:35.389 --> 03:54:35.399 align:start position:0%
about as of a few minutes ago about 150
 
03:54:40.189 --> 03:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
of the 172 in opposition are from out of
 
03:54:43.070 --> 03:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
state thank you did you have a follow-up
 
03:54:46.110 --> 03:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
representative um you all said yeah I
 
03:54:48.870 --> 03:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
guess I do have another one so um do you
 
03:54:52.389 --> 03:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
mind no no all right so the the chief
 
03:54:54.110 --> 03:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
reason medical reason given for
 
03:54:57.469 --> 03:54:57.479 align:start position:0%
circumcision is um to prevent or
 
03:54:58.710 --> 03:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
minimize the risk of sexually
 
03:55:01.630 --> 03:55:01.640 align:start position:0%
transmitted disease later in life um in
 
03:55:04.309 --> 03:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
countries where those are endemic uh
 
03:55:05.950 --> 03:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
especially AIDS it is actually
 
03:55:07.590 --> 03:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
recommended for medical reasons that it
 
03:55:10.429 --> 03:55:10.439 align:start position:0%
be done in the United States is are
 
03:55:12.630 --> 03:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
these STDs particularly AIDS considered
 
03:55:14.309 --> 03:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
endemic enough for us to consider
 
03:55:15.950 --> 03:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
consider this as more than elective or
 
03:55:18.590 --> 03:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
not me medically there is no reason to
 
03:55:21.510 --> 03:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
get this there is it does not decrease
 
03:55:23.910 --> 03:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
overall just having the circumcision
 
03:55:27.349 --> 03:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
does is not what decreases the infection
 
03:55:31.750 --> 03:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
um it it's education or excuse me um
 
03:55:33.510 --> 03:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
it's not the circumcision that will
 
03:55:36.550 --> 03:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
decrease it we can combat that by doing
 
03:55:38.349 --> 03:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
proper education and teaching people how
 
03:55:40.710 --> 03:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
to keep a clean penis and how to have
 
03:55:44.070 --> 03:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
safe sex so a circumcision we don't cut
 
03:55:45.830 --> 03:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
off pieces of people's body for other
 
03:55:48.349 --> 03:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
reasons preventatively right we don't we
 
03:55:50.429 --> 03:55:50.439 align:start position:0%
don't we don't remove everyone's breasts
 
03:55:52.950 --> 03:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
because they might get breast cancer
 
03:55:55.670 --> 03:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
someday some we do right but not but not
 
03:55:57.550 --> 03:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
across the board right we do it when
 
03:56:00.590 --> 03:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
there's a medical necessity for it not
 
03:56:02.429 --> 03:56:02.439 align:start position:0%
as a preventative
 
03:56:04.950 --> 03:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
measure uh representative paza and then
 
03:56:07.790 --> 03:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
representative Woods thank you Mr chair
 
03:56:10.149 --> 03:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question if
 
03:56:12.510 --> 03:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
you can help me with uh
 
03:56:15.389 --> 03:56:15.399 align:start position:0%
terminology so between not medically
 
03:56:18.070 --> 03:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
necessary and elective do I understand
 
03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
correctly that not medically necessary
 
03:56:25.269 --> 03:56:25.279 align:start position:0%
is a sub group of uh larger group of el
 
03:56:28.070 --> 03:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
elective procedures and that elective
 
03:56:31.429 --> 03:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
means uh not urgent but nonmedically
 
03:56:33.950 --> 03:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
necessary is like means there's no no
 
03:56:36.750 --> 03:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
medical benefit I might even refer to
 
03:56:38.550 --> 03:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
some of the dogs here I'm not sure that
 
03:56:40.830 --> 03:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
there is an official definition or where
 
03:56:43.710 --> 03:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
that definition would come from I think
 
03:56:46.070 --> 03:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
commonly they're used interchangeably
 
03:56:48.790 --> 03:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
but I could be incorrect there um what I
 
03:56:50.550 --> 03:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
can tell you is if something is
 
03:56:52.590 --> 03:56:52.600 align:start position:0%
medically my take on it if something is
 
03:56:54.750 --> 03:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
medically unnecessary then choosing it
 
03:56:58.630 --> 03:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
would be elective but I could be
 
03:57:02.389 --> 03:57:02.399 align:start position:0%
corrected representative Woods I'll set
 
03:57:05.389 --> 03:57:05.399 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else any other
 
03:57:08.349 --> 03:57:08.359 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
03:57:09.870 --> 03:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
you very much for this opportunity I
 
03:57:17.950 --> 03:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:19.349 --> 03:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:25.309 --> 03:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
Edwards and if you could hold it to
 
03:57:27.189 --> 03:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
about three minutes
 
03:57:29.790 --> 03:57:29.800 align:start position:0%
representative that should do it uh
 
03:57:32.269 --> 03:57:32.279 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards uh i' I've
 
03:57:35.070 --> 03:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
introduced myself today uh so I'll I'll
 
03:57:38.950 --> 03:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
dive into it um so part of the homework
 
03:57:41.469 --> 03:57:41.479 align:start position:0%
that I've been engaged in with division
 
03:57:44.630 --> 03:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
3 which is the DHHS
 
03:57:47.070 --> 03:57:47.080 align:start position:0%
resource committee budget committee uh
 
03:57:49.750 --> 03:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
finance committee um has been to be
 
03:57:52.710 --> 03:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
taking a look at the agency budget and
 
03:57:55.030 --> 03:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
looking for ways in which we might
 
03:57:58.550 --> 03:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
reduce it um and uh as we're going
 
03:58:01.510 --> 03:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
through there I asked the question what
 
03:58:05.269 --> 03:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
would happen if we were to uh say that
 
03:58:09.630 --> 03:58:09.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid uh should not be paying for and
 
03:58:12.670 --> 03:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
I use the phrase elective surgery and
 
03:58:15.510 --> 03:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
and I think Dr Woods has made me think
 
03:58:17.510 --> 03:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
well maybe the real word I'm looking for
 
03:58:20.630 --> 03:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
is cosmetic surgery you know some
 
03:58:24.309 --> 03:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
category uh where um a certain type of
 
03:58:26.790 --> 03:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
procedure uh isn't banned I don't think
 
03:58:29.110 --> 03:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
we should be in the business of banning
 
03:58:31.950 --> 03:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
but as the stewards of the State dollars
 
03:58:34.590 --> 03:58:34.600 align:start position:0%
we should definitely be in the business
 
03:58:37.309 --> 03:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
of determining what's an appropriate
 
03:58:41.030 --> 03:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable um element of care for uh a
 
03:58:44.790 --> 03:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid recipient and uh and I I think
 
03:58:47.670 --> 03:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
rather than I don't like this shot or
 
03:58:50.469 --> 03:58:50.479 align:start position:0%
this sniper approach of going in and
 
03:58:53.830 --> 03:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
picking a procedure do this procedure by
 
03:58:55.070 --> 03:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
procedure I think that's an
 
03:58:58.229 --> 03:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
inappropriate legislative action um and
 
03:59:00.110 --> 03:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
I developed that with
 
03:59:03.910 --> 03:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
the around representative uh Weber long
 
03:59:06.510 --> 03:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
ago when we were dealing with uh uh
 
03:59:09.630 --> 03:59:09.640 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis and we were nicklin and
 
03:59:13.229 --> 03:59:13.239 align:start position:0%
Diamond uh diagnoses over and over and I
 
03:59:15.510 --> 03:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
just thought this is not the way the
 
03:59:17.309 --> 03:59:17.319 align:start position:0%
legislature should be engaging the
 
03:59:20.750 --> 03:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
medical field so so from that I I
 
03:59:23.189 --> 03:59:23.199 align:start position:0%
develop the Fe feeling that we should be
 
03:59:26.910 --> 03:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
talking about types of care not specific
 
03:59:29.550 --> 03:59:29.560 align:start position:0%
elements of care and if we were to say
 
03:59:31.750 --> 03:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
something like you know Medicaid shall
 
03:59:35.149 --> 03:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
not reimburse for uh cosmetic or
 
03:59:36.950 --> 03:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
whatever I'll I'll let I'll defer to the
 
03:59:39.670 --> 03:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
medical people on what the right word is
 
03:59:42.590 --> 03:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
I think we would also capture in that um
 
03:59:44.950 --> 03:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
the female version which is a
 
03:59:47.110 --> 03:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
clitorectomy uh which is probably
 
03:59:50.149 --> 03:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
something that uh Medicaid dollars also
 
03:59:52.510 --> 03:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
should not be paying for so instead of
 
03:59:54.790 --> 03:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
doing these one bill at a time kinds of
 
03:59:57.389 --> 03:59:57.399 align:start position:0%
things I I think it would be much better
 
04:00:00.469 --> 04:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
if we just stayed at a conceptual level
 
04:00:02.590 --> 04:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
and left the medical profession to
 
04:00:04.870 --> 04:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
interact with their patients we're not
 
04:00:07.229 --> 04:00:07.239 align:start position:0%
in the business of banning we are in the
 
04:00:09.510 --> 04:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
business of deciding how to use scarce
 
04:00:12.229 --> 04:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
Healthcare dollar so with that I'll take
 
04:00:16.070 --> 04:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you hi representative
 
04:00:18.149 --> 04:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and thank you for taking
 
04:00:19.790 --> 04:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:00:24.149 --> 04:00:24.159 align:start position:0%
um and I understand your um schematic
 
04:00:25.910 --> 04:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
for how to deal with these and in many
 
04:00:28.630 --> 04:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
ways I I agree with it because I think
 
04:00:30.309 --> 04:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise you
 
04:00:33.269 --> 04:00:33.279 align:start position:0%
get the question of what's equivalent to
 
04:00:35.149 --> 04:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
what else I think you're going to get
 
04:00:39.990 --> 04:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
that if you try to Define also but my
 
04:00:42.389 --> 04:00:42.399 align:start position:0%
question is if you're looking at a
 
04:00:47.429 --> 04:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
strict cost issue yeah um I know that
 
04:00:50.110 --> 04:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
representative bman used in her te
 
04:00:52.830 --> 04:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
referred in her testimony that need to
 
04:00:56.149 --> 04:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
educate parents about the proper care of
 
04:00:59.670 --> 04:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
the foreskin and I am aware anecdotally
 
04:01:04.429 --> 04:01:04.439 align:start position:0%
of a family where three boys had to have
 
04:01:06.990 --> 04:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
circumcision procedures later in their
 
04:01:10.189 --> 04:01:10.199 align:start position:0%
childhood because that those procedures
 
04:01:14.710 --> 04:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
have not been followed so um do you have
 
04:01:18.630 --> 04:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
any knowledge or opinion about what
 
04:01:21.229 --> 04:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
whether we might be saving
 
04:01:26.630 --> 04:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
on initial care but incurring more in
 
04:01:30.149 --> 04:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
after care if we neglect the educational
 
04:01:33.030 --> 04:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
piece that comes with it in either case
 
04:01:35.030 --> 04:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so thank you for the question and I
 
04:01:36.830 --> 04:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
I have to disclaim my background
 
04:01:38.429 --> 04:01:38.439 align:start position:0%
although I've been working in healthc
 
04:01:41.389 --> 04:01:41.399 align:start position:0%
care from a managerial role for over 40
 
04:01:44.870 --> 04:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
50 years now uh I don't pretend and uh
 
04:01:47.870 --> 04:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
have any diagnostic knowledge uh that's
 
04:01:50.550 --> 04:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
that's worth a Committee hearing um to
 
04:01:54.110 --> 04:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
the question though of of of of finances
 
04:01:57.870 --> 04:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
and the DHHS organization I'd say that
 
04:01:59.950 --> 04:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
they do have a component of Public
 
04:02:02.389 --> 04:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
Health and that we have experts and
 
04:02:05.670 --> 04:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
professionals who worry about you know
 
04:02:07.550 --> 04:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh what kind of Public Health is
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
necessary to maintain a healthy
 
04:02:12.830 --> 04:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
Community we have a public health force
 
04:02:15.670 --> 04:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
that takes look at Health Equity issues
 
04:02:17.870 --> 04:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
to take a look to see if we have any
 
04:02:19.990 --> 04:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
cultures uh or
 
04:02:23.070 --> 04:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
demographics uh who specifically need to
 
04:02:24.910 --> 04:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
be some intervention knowledge
 
04:02:27.389 --> 04:02:27.399 align:start position:0%
intervention so that they can equally
 
04:02:30.590 --> 04:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
access the Health Care system so so so I
 
04:02:32.870 --> 04:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
know that we have a distinct public
 
04:02:36.269 --> 04:02:36.279 align:start position:0%
health education area and I would not be
 
04:02:38.550 --> 04:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
bringing you know circumcision into that
 
04:02:41.149 --> 04:02:41.159 align:start position:0%
or yes or no I would just say let's
 
04:02:43.110 --> 04:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
let's set up the systems and let the
 
04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
professionals run with it with our
 
04:02:48.389 --> 04:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
expertise or with our our general uh
 
04:02:50.990 --> 04:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
consent and and resourcing to the issue
 
04:02:53.710 --> 04:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
of dollars when I'm talking to my LBA I
 
04:02:56.590 --> 04:02:56.600 align:start position:0%
said so how much might we save he said
 
04:02:59.030 --> 04:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's probably 50,000 maybe 100,000 a
 
04:03:01.910 --> 04:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
year now he's not a doctor either so we
 
04:03:03.950 --> 04:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
didn't say okay well if you avoid this
 
04:03:06.550 --> 04:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
procedure you may incur this other
 
04:03:08.630 --> 04:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
procedure we didn't we didn't do the
 
04:03:11.110 --> 04:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
health economics we were just looking at
 
04:03:12.910 --> 04:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
you know how much General funds might we
 
04:03:15.389 --> 04:03:15.399 align:start position:0%
save if we if we uh put a restriction
 
04:03:18.990 --> 04:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:21.469 --> 04:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
Eligibility other
 
04:03:23.790 --> 04:03:23.800 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
04:03:26.429 --> 04:03:26.439 align:start position:0%
Lamonte thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:03:29.189 --> 04:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question some people may
 
04:03:30.950 --> 04:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:03:35.189 --> 04:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
circumcision and the choice to make that
 
04:03:37.469 --> 04:03:37.479 align:start position:0%
um for a family with their doctor as a
 
04:03:40.469 --> 04:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
parental rights issue do you think by
 
04:03:43.269 --> 04:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation we might be
 
04:03:46.510 --> 04:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
saying people on Medicaid have less
 
04:03:49.229 --> 04:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
choice in their parent to exercise their
 
04:03:51.590 --> 04:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
parental rights than than people have
 
04:03:51.600 --> 04:03:52.630 align:start position:0%
parental rights than than people have
private

04:03:52.630 --> 04:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
private
 
04:03:56.189 --> 04:03:56.199 align:start position:0%
insurance I thank you for the question I
 
04:03:58.710 --> 04:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
I I I haven't thought through it so I'm
 
04:04:00.429 --> 04:04:00.439 align:start position:0%
I'm going to Freewheel it a little bit
 
04:04:02.469 --> 04:04:02.479 align:start position:0%
it feels to me like maybe you're you're
 
04:04:04.429 --> 04:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
conflating a couple of very important
 
04:04:06.309 --> 04:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
things that don't necessarily need to be
 
04:04:08.510 --> 04:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
appended to one another there's a
 
04:04:10.149 --> 04:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
there's a parent certainly there's a
 
04:04:13.750 --> 04:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
parental rights thing and and and and I
 
04:04:15.510 --> 04:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
would address that more from the angle
 
04:04:18.269 --> 04:04:18.279 align:start position:0%
of you know let's not ban the procedure
 
04:04:20.269 --> 04:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
you know if if if it's appropriate to
 
04:04:22.710 --> 04:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
educate them around it let's I'm okay
 
04:04:25.830 --> 04:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
with that too um but I I would I would
 
04:04:30.229 --> 04:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
keep that distinct from the obligations
 
04:04:33.550 --> 04:04:33.560 align:start position:0%
of the state to pay for a service and
 
04:04:35.070 --> 04:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
the money that we spend through the
 
04:04:38.309 --> 04:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program in my belief uh we
 
04:04:42.189 --> 04:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
ought to be focusing on taking scarce
 
04:04:44.910 --> 04:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
resources and applying them to where
 
04:04:48.429 --> 04:04:48.439 align:start position:0%
they are of most use and so I would
 
04:04:51.790 --> 04:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
avoid anything that was kind of cosmetic
 
04:04:54.990 --> 04:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
in in nature and uh I could get myself
 
04:04:57.510 --> 04:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
in trouble with that even because if
 
04:05:00.070 --> 04:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
after a a breast
 
04:05:03.510 --> 04:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
removal a patient may want some sort of
 
04:05:07.149 --> 04:05:07.159 align:start position:0%
surgical um rebuild reconstruction and
 
04:05:08.309 --> 04:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know from a
 
04:05:10.349 --> 04:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
psychological perspective if that would
 
04:05:12.870 --> 04:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
be the right way to go I I'm not a I'm
 
04:05:15.110 --> 04:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
not a healthcare provider I'm a i
 
04:05:17.429 --> 04:05:17.439 align:start position:0%
resource healthc care and I'd rather
 
04:05:21.070 --> 04:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
just give them U Concepts and principles
 
04:05:22.950 --> 04:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
and and that should be in the law not
 
04:05:27.229 --> 04:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:30.110 --> 04:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
details other questions representative n
 
04:05:31.950 --> 04:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
04:05:33.710 --> 04:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
my question you just kind of raised an
 
04:05:35.830 --> 04:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
issue for me about this particular bill
 
04:05:37.670 --> 04:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
and I wanted your opinion on this yes
 
04:05:40.510 --> 04:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
sir so um it lists all the indications
 
04:05:42.429 --> 04:05:42.439 align:start position:0%
for which you can do a circumcision and
 
04:05:44.870 --> 04:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
letter k on page who says for any
 
04:05:46.389 --> 04:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
diagnosed condition for which a
 
04:05:48.070 --> 04:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
circumcision is deemed medically
 
04:05:50.910 --> 04:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
necessary by a Health Physician or
 
04:05:52.469 --> 04:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
healthc care provider license in New
 
04:05:53.830 --> 04:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think you know me well
 
04:05:55.550 --> 04:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
enough that I practice what we call
 
04:05:57.510 --> 04:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
biopsychosocial medicine where I look at
 
04:05:59.950 --> 04:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
the entire person and and so there's
 
04:06:03.309 --> 04:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
biological psychological social
 
04:06:06.149 --> 04:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
diagnosis it seems to me that this line
 
04:06:07.950 --> 04:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
pretty much nullifies the whole effect
 
04:06:09.710 --> 04:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
of the entire bill because I can be
 
04:06:11.590 --> 04:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
incredibly creative in coming up with a
 
04:06:13.870 --> 04:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
medical reason to justify why I'm doing
 
04:06:15.710 --> 04:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
from that perspective is that a problem
 
04:06:18.670 --> 04:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
with this bill do you think I you I I
 
04:06:21.110 --> 04:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
have a the my problem comes in a more
 
04:06:22.910 --> 04:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
strategic level so I haven't walked
 
04:06:24.550 --> 04:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
around in the in the muck where you're
 
04:06:28.790 --> 04:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
at uh I I I don't like just overtly
 
04:06:32.910 --> 04:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
picking out a medical procedure and and
 
04:06:35.469 --> 04:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
giving a thumbs up or thumbs down on a
 
04:06:39.349 --> 04:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
procedure I think uh it's up to us to
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
come up with what the right uh concept
 
04:06:44.790 --> 04:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
is to hand over to the Health Care
 
04:06:46.110 --> 04:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
Professionals and the people who
 
04:06:49.349 --> 04:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
reimburse for these services and and
 
04:06:53.229 --> 04:06:53.239 align:start position:0%
basically stay out of um politicizing a
 
04:06:56.429 --> 04:06:56.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:59.990 --> 04:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
procedure other questions representative
 
04:07:02.990 --> 04:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
delus thank you Mr
 
04:07:05.349 --> 04:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
chairman so representative do you think
 
04:07:08.550 --> 04:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:11.630 --> 04:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
amended uh it the the it belongs to the
 
04:07:13.590 --> 04:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
committee now if I were on your
 
04:07:15.790 --> 04:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
committee I would have a real problem
 
04:07:17.429 --> 04:07:17.439 align:start position:0%
with this without a significant
 
04:07:20.510 --> 04:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment because I think uh while well-
 
04:07:23.550 --> 04:07:23.560 align:start position:0%
intended it I I it feels to me like it's
 
04:07:26.830 --> 04:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
a a a horsedrawn wagon going down the
 
04:07:29.750 --> 04:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:32.229 --> 04:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
fast other question representative
 
04:07:34.830 --> 04:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
hartnet thank you Mr chair uh thanks for
 
04:07:36.349 --> 04:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
taking the question this is a little bit
 
04:07:38.790 --> 04:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
off point but are you suggesting that we
 
04:07:41.189 --> 04:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
should uh in effect with Medicaid create
 
04:07:43.990 --> 04:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
a list of prioritized conditions
 
04:07:46.510 --> 04:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
that we would move up or down on uh
 
04:07:48.590 --> 04:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
based on
 
04:07:50.990 --> 04:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
resources that's an interesting concept
 
04:07:52.830 --> 04:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
Oregon has done that you know where
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
they're Medicaid they've got you know
 
04:07:57.830 --> 04:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
1,500 procedures racked and stacked and
 
04:07:59.710 --> 04:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
if you start running out of money you
 
04:08:02.990 --> 04:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
line it out at the bottom um that's that
 
04:08:05.510 --> 04:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
would require a very mature uh
 
04:08:08.229 --> 04:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
organizational structure at DHHS that we
 
04:08:10.309 --> 04:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
don't have today so I wouldn't propose
 
04:08:13.590 --> 04:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
that as a as a solution and so I'm
 
04:08:16.030 --> 04:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
looking for um kind of maybe a more
 
04:08:19.750 --> 04:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
sophomoric approach to keep it
 
04:08:23.030 --> 04:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
simple follow up yeah just but you like
 
04:08:23.040 --> 04:08:24.670 align:start position:0%
simple follow up yeah just but you like
the

04:08:24.670 --> 04:08:24.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:08:27.469 --> 04:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
concept the concept of how uh organ
 
04:08:31.109 --> 04:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid does it on a rack basis I I I
 
04:08:33.870 --> 04:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
actually don't because what they've done
 
04:08:36.109 --> 04:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
is they've gone in and they've
 
04:08:38.469 --> 04:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
determined through whatever process they
 
04:08:42.030 --> 04:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
have of which procedure is more valuable
 
04:08:45.189 --> 04:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
than another and that is the business of
 
04:08:50.389 --> 04:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
health eth ethicists and economists and
 
04:08:53.189 --> 04:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very complicated process and
 
04:08:55.950 --> 04:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know that that's where we want
 
04:08:58.510 --> 04:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
government at that level of
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
detail where we would basically be um
 
04:09:05.309 --> 04:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
putting our own uh Financial protocols
 
04:09:09.389 --> 04:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
in place of a healthy patient um
 
04:09:09.399 --> 04:09:11.149 align:start position:0%
in place of a healthy patient um
provider

04:09:11.149 --> 04:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
provider
 
04:09:13.850 --> 04:09:13.860 align:start position:0%

questions seeing none thank you uh thank

you for your time marel thank you for
 
04:09:23.309 --> 04:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
taking thank you for taking my call uh
 
04:09:26.309 --> 04:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
my question uh so can you give me a
 
04:09:28.750 --> 04:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
working definition of what medically
 
04:09:28.760 --> 04:09:34.550 align:start position:0%
working definition of what medically
necessary

04:09:34.550 --> 04:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:37.990 --> 04:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
is I I I I am not qualified to answer
 
04:09:40.229 --> 04:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
your question if we were sitting around
 
04:09:42.590 --> 04:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
having a beer talking about it i' I'd
 
04:09:45.149 --> 04:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
throw about some ideas at you that I
 
04:09:46.389 --> 04:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't ever want to be held
 
04:09:49.149 --> 04:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
accountable for I I would just ass soon
 
04:09:51.830 --> 04:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
come to a committee that's with has
 
04:09:55.149 --> 04:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
nurses and Physicians and PAs and say
 
04:09:57.950 --> 04:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
hey here as a finance guy here's what
 
04:10:00.189 --> 04:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking would you please take this
 
04:10:02.229 --> 04:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
to the next level of maturity let's
 
04:10:04.269 --> 04:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
figure out how to get this concept in
 
04:10:06.870 --> 04:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
place with the right terminology so that
 
04:10:10.710 --> 04:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
we can delegate to uh the Professionals
 
04:10:13.510 --> 04:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
in the field you know our expectation
 
04:10:15.510 --> 04:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
what needs to be the circumstance under
 
04:10:17.149 --> 04:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
which they get
 
04:10:19.349 --> 04:10:19.359 align:start position:0%
reimbursed thank
 
04:10:21.590 --> 04:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
you other
 
04:10:23.590 --> 04:10:23.600 align:start position:0%

stop state coverage of circumcision my

together we have raised two sons and a

procedure is readily solicited to

unassuming parents as if it was Alle leg
 
04:11:39.550 --> 04:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
legitimate choice to

make I am here to tell you circumcision
 
04:11:46.870 --> 04:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
is not a sound medical Choice Physicians

04:12:12.510 --> 04:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
obvious American parents are sold a lie
 
04:12:14.429 --> 04:12:14.439 align:start position:0%
and the state of New Hampshire should
 
04:12:17.389 --> 04:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
not pay for it parents assume they are
 
04:12:20.550 --> 04:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
doing a favor to their sons but doctors
 
04:12:22.870 --> 04:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
do not share with them information at
 
04:12:25.149 --> 04:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
all on the benefits of keeping their
 
04:12:28.990 --> 04:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
sons intact if your boys were born in
 
04:12:30.990 --> 04:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
most any other part of the
 
04:12:33.630 --> 04:12:33.640 align:start position:0%
world they would be no more likely to be
 
04:12:36.590 --> 04:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
circumcised than your girls if medical
 
04:12:39.269 --> 04:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
quacks in the Victorian era had not
 
04:12:41.670 --> 04:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
popularized this procedure to prevent
 
04:12:44.309 --> 04:12:44.319 align:start position:0%
all imagined ills from
 
04:12:46.590 --> 04:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
masturbation and modern doctors in this
 
04:12:48.950 --> 04:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
country wouldn't have duped you into
 
04:12:51.429 --> 04:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
believing that it's healthier you would
 
04:12:53.189 --> 04:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
have never considered
 
04:12:55.750 --> 04:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
it your protective instincts would have
 
04:12:58.670 --> 04:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
kicked in like ours did and you would
 
04:13:01.229 --> 04:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
not have allowed an authority figure to
 
04:13:03.550 --> 04:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
get anywhere near your precious baby's
 
04:13:05.710 --> 04:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
genitals where they could leave an
 
04:13:08.910 --> 04:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
irreversible mark on
 
04:13:11.990 --> 04:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
it why are doctors subjecting innocent
 
04:13:14.229 --> 04:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
infants to such torturous genital
 
04:13:16.630 --> 04:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
reducing surgeries when they are
 
04:13:18.030 --> 04:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
powerless to
 
04:13:20.550 --> 04:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
resist why would we cut off parts of our
 
04:13:23.030 --> 04:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
bodies for Hygiene when we could just
 
04:13:26.550 --> 04:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
wash them instead why would you trash
 
04:13:29.149 --> 04:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
erogenous tissue when you can just
 
04:13:31.349 --> 04:13:31.359 align:start position:0%
practice safe sex to prevent
 
04:13:35.510 --> 04:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
diseases if I came to you with a scalpel
 
04:13:37.389 --> 04:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
and demanded you give up an erogenous
 
04:13:39.429 --> 04:13:39.439 align:start position:0%
tissue from anywhere in your body you
 
04:13:42.070 --> 04:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
would think I was crazy yet this is
 
04:13:44.189 --> 04:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
exactly what is done to boys every
 
04:13:47.349 --> 04:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
single day in America boys deserve
 
04:13:50.550 --> 04:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
respect just like our girls do it's not
 
04:13:53.710 --> 04:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
their body that needs to be cut but the
 
04:13:56.670 --> 04:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
funds that our state contributes to
 
04:13:59.670 --> 04:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
perpetuating a misguided practice whose
 
04:14:01.750 --> 04:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
time has come to
 
04:14:05.109 --> 04:14:05.119 align:start position:0%
end Moes do not get reimbursed by any
 
04:14:06.870 --> 04:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
health insurance for performing
 
04:14:09.550 --> 04:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
religious circumcision on the eighth day
 
04:14:11.790 --> 04:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
of life which is when their procedure
 
04:14:14.269 --> 04:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
must be done performing this surgery in
 
04:14:17.149 --> 04:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
the hospital doesn't satisfy the
 
04:14:17.159 --> 04:14:18.630 align:start position:0%
the hospital doesn't satisfy the
religious

04:14:18.630 --> 04:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
religious
 
04:14:21.189 --> 04:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
Covenant Muslims also do not typically
 
04:14:22.710 --> 04:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
have their circumcision ceremonies at
 
04:14:24.469 --> 04:14:24.479 align:start position:0%
Birth but when the boy is nearing
 
04:14:26.590 --> 04:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
puberty thank you very much and if you
 
04:14:29.550 --> 04:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
have any questions thank you thank you
 
04:14:29.560 --> 04:14:31.990 align:start position:0%
have any questions thank you thank you
any

04:14:31.990 --> 04:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:34.030 --> 04:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
questions don't see any thank you very
 
04:14:41.469 --> 04:14:41.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:43.870 --> 04:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
04:14:45.149 --> 04:14:45.159 align:start position:0%
representative Ellen Reed from
 
04:14:55.309 --> 04:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:57.910 --> 04:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
10 thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:14:59.389 --> 04:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
honorable members I wasn't sure if I was
 
04:15:01.870 --> 04:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
going to testify or not so I've I've
 
04:15:03.510 --> 04:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
just written down some of the questions
 
04:15:05.550 --> 04:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
I've heard just for introduction my name
 
04:15:10.269 --> 04:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
is Ellen Reed I um serve Rockingham 10
 
04:15:12.750 --> 04:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
that is New Market and newfields I was a
 
04:15:15.469 --> 04:15:15.479 align:start position:0%
CO sponsor of both bills last term spoke
 
04:15:17.510 --> 04:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
on both bills in committee spoke on them
 
04:15:21.510 --> 04:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
on the floor as well um for disclosure I
 
04:15:24.149 --> 04:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
am a staunch proponent of a single-payer
 
04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
Health Care system I believe Healthcare
 
04:15:28.189 --> 04:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
is a human right one of the arguments
 
04:15:30.670 --> 04:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
I've heard about this particular bill is
 
04:15:32.189 --> 04:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
that it might be an attack on Medicaid
 
04:15:33.510 --> 04:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to try to go through some
 
04:15:36.550 --> 04:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
of the questions I heard and um I'm I'm
 
04:15:37.950 --> 04:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
Distributing an amendment which I will
 
04:15:39.429 --> 04:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
explain shortly and I hope the chair
 
04:15:45.229 --> 04:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:46.950 --> 04:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
I think when we talk about a lot of
 
04:15:48.269 --> 04:15:48.279 align:start position:0%
issues like this that we've kind of
 
04:15:49.990 --> 04:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
adopted in our society we have an
 
04:15:52.269 --> 04:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
emotional reaction because we have a an
 
04:15:54.790 --> 04:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
investment in in our knowledge of what
 
04:15:56.750 --> 04:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
the world is what is okay and acceptable
 
04:15:58.269 --> 04:15:58.279 align:start position:0%
what we're used to and so there's often
 
04:16:00.670 --> 04:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
a very emotional reaction but the thing
 
04:16:03.990 --> 04:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
is is that if you look at the facts
 
04:16:06.790 --> 04:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
neonatal non-medically
 
04:16:10.590 --> 04:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
necessary um circumcision is mutilation
 
04:16:13.189 --> 04:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
it's mutilation of a child's body part
 
04:16:15.109 --> 04:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
against that child's will I know we've
 
04:16:16.870 --> 04:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
had the question of Parental Choice come
 
04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
up come up but you can talk about
 
04:16:21.189 --> 04:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
parental choice and I don't think I
 
04:16:23.070 --> 04:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
think in terms of cosmetic procedures
 
04:16:24.750 --> 04:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
it's across the board people without
 
04:16:26.630 --> 04:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
funds don't have as much Choice as
 
04:16:28.630 --> 04:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
people with with funds have when it
 
04:16:30.710 --> 04:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
comes to cosmetic procedures which this
 
04:16:34.349 --> 04:16:34.359 align:start position:0%
is um but it's not really about parental
 
04:16:36.070 --> 04:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
choice because that's a child's body
 
04:16:37.790 --> 04:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
that child will become an 18-year-old
 
04:16:40.429 --> 04:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
one day and that that choice was taken
 
04:16:41.510 --> 04:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
away from
 
04:16:43.630 --> 04:16:43.640 align:start position:0%
them I don't
 
04:16:46.030 --> 04:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
frequently get to say that I agreed with
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
much of what representative Edwards said
 
04:16:51.349 --> 04:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
but I did agree with a lot um he brought
 
04:16:53.229 --> 04:16:53.239 align:start position:0%
up female genital mutilation I wanted to
 
04:16:55.389 --> 04:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
correct the record female genital
 
04:16:56.910 --> 04:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
mutilation which comes in many forms
 
04:16:59.149 --> 04:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
some of which are far more severe a
 
04:17:01.710 --> 04:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
clitorectomy is more severe than a male
 
04:17:03.950 --> 04:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
circumcision um but the most common is
 
04:17:05.910 --> 04:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
the REM removal of the clitoral hood
 
04:17:08.269 --> 04:17:08.279 align:start position:0%
which is exactly analogous to
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
circumcision and that's illegal forget
 
04:17:12.990 --> 04:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that's illegal federally it's
 
04:17:14.309 --> 04:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
legal in the state it's illegal I'm
 
04:17:15.870 --> 04:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
pretty sure in all 50 states in addition
 
04:17:19.389 --> 04:17:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:22.910 --> 04:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
mutilation um the question was brought
 
04:17:27.309 --> 04:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
about the cost versus um save analysis
 
04:17:32.269 --> 04:17:32.279 align:start position:0%
um so the the numbers are um about uh
 
04:17:34.670 --> 04:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
one in six depending on how you define a
 
04:17:37.109 --> 04:17:37.119 align:start position:0%
complication one in six to 1 in 20
 
04:17:39.070 --> 04:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
neonatal circumcisions result in a
 
04:17:41.109 --> 04:17:41.119 align:start position:0%
complication the prime sponsor last year
 
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
had a very compelling story that she
 
04:17:44.830 --> 04:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
said to this committee about what
 
04:17:46.910 --> 04:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
happened with her son that ranges from
 
04:17:47.990 --> 04:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere when you're talking about one
 
04:17:50.790 --> 04:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
in six to like excessive bleeding um and
 
04:17:55.109 --> 04:17:55.119 align:start position:0%
excessive pain to um lifelong disability
 
04:17:57.750 --> 04:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
and in some cases death in fact over and
 
04:17:59.149 --> 04:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
this is not New Hampshire it's across
 
04:18:02.550 --> 04:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
the country but 100 baby boys die from
 
04:18:04.710 --> 04:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
results of complications of neonatal
 
04:18:07.750 --> 04:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
circumcision a year the save analysis of
 
04:18:09.510 --> 04:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
that is if you don't do that how many of
 
04:18:11.950 --> 04:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
them need circumcision later in life
 
04:18:13.790 --> 04:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
that answer is one in
 
04:18:17.309 --> 04:18:17.319 align:start position:0%
16,000 80% of the world is not
 
04:18:20.030 --> 04:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
circumcised animals are not circumcised
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
horses dogs cats they all have
 
04:18:25.590 --> 04:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
forkin complications in their lives from
 
04:18:28.309 --> 04:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
infections for having foreskin very very
 
04:18:31.550 --> 04:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
rare so you can save all of those circum
 
04:18:33.630 --> 04:18:33.640 align:start position:0%
Neal circumcisions and then one in
 
04:18:36.389 --> 04:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
16,000 may need an adult I do think I
 
04:18:38.189 --> 04:18:38.199 align:start position:0%
know who the representative is referring
 
04:18:40.510 --> 04:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
to about that Family who was a genetic
 
04:18:42.149 --> 04:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
predisposition but that particular
 
04:18:45.070 --> 04:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
person please um was in favor of the
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
bill last year um so let me skip over
 
04:18:49.710 --> 04:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
some of these other things and get to
 
04:18:51.790 --> 04:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment that I distributed because
 
04:18:53.710 --> 04:18:53.720 align:start position:0%
I don't want this seen as an attack on
 
04:18:56.109 --> 04:18:56.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid uh even though the the amount
 
04:18:58.950 --> 04:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
is very minor about $100,000 but I have
 
04:19:01.469 --> 04:19:01.479 align:start position:0%
a procedural question Mr Mr chairman
 
04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative Weber sure um the
 
04:19:08.510 --> 04:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
amendment as far as I can see uh relates
 
04:19:10.429 --> 04:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
entirely to the children's vision
 
04:19:12.790 --> 04:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
screening it's a non- ger and how is it
 
04:19:15.229 --> 04:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
it's a non-g gerine Amendment so isn't
 
04:19:17.389 --> 04:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
my understanding we cannot hear it now
 
04:19:19.550 --> 04:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
you're not hearing it I'm explaining
 
04:19:21.510 --> 04:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
what I think is a solution to one of the
 
04:19:23.950 --> 04:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
main arguments of the bill before you if
 
04:19:25.389 --> 04:19:25.399 align:start position:0%
the argument to the bill before you is
 
04:19:27.070 --> 04:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
that it's an attack on Medicaid then the
 
04:19:29.469 --> 04:19:29.479 align:start position:0%
solution is to take those funds and
 
04:19:31.990 --> 04:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
reallocate it to another service this
 
04:19:34.910 --> 04:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
particular service is a service that was
 
04:19:36.790 --> 04:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh very seriously considered by this
 
04:19:38.670 --> 04:19:38.680 align:start position:0%
committee over the last two years which
 
04:19:40.309 --> 04:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
is the idea of a vision screening
 
04:19:42.990 --> 04:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
program you retained that bill you did
 
04:19:45.469 --> 04:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
an interim study on that bill and then a
 
04:19:47.070 --> 04:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
large percentage of this committee was
 
04:19:49.309 --> 04:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
still in favor of that program my
 
04:19:51.349 --> 04:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
understanding is that program costs very
 
04:19:53.710 --> 04:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
little similar to the circumcision so
 
04:19:55.750 --> 04:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's a kind of a one for one you take
 
04:19:57.189 --> 04:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
away this coverage and you give that
 
04:19:59.109 --> 04:19:59.119 align:start position:0%
coverage you're not attacking Medicaid
 
04:20:00.550 --> 04:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
we're still covering children but in
 
04:20:02.109 --> 04:20:02.119 align:start position:0%
this case we're covering actual medical
 
04:20:04.950 --> 04:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
needs instead of covering the only
 
04:20:06.750 --> 04:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
cosmetic procedure non-reconstructive
 
04:20:09.469 --> 04:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
procedure paid for by taxpayer funds we
 
04:20:11.469 --> 04:20:11.479 align:start position:0%
are no longer covering mutilating
 
04:20:13.510 --> 04:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
children and I guess take
 
04:20:15.269 --> 04:20:15.279 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for
 
04:20:18.870 --> 04:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative Reed yes representative
 
04:20:21.710 --> 04:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:20:25.830 --> 04:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
for taking uh my question uh
 
04:20:31.429 --> 04:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
so um in terms of uh medical necessary
 
04:20:34.590 --> 04:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
procedures uh is it true that one of the
 
04:20:39.469 --> 04:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
need for newborns to get vitamin K shot
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
is to help with bleeding after the
 
04:20:46.870 --> 04:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
circumcision and so is it true that if
 
04:20:50.910 --> 04:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
we um diminish cases of circumcision
 
04:20:54.109 --> 04:20:54.119 align:start position:0%
there will be less need and expenses for
 
04:20:56.950 --> 04:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
vitamin K shots um thank you for the
 
04:20:58.950 --> 04:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
question I am under the understanding
 
04:21:01.510 --> 04:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
vitamin K shots are not very expensive
 
04:21:03.590 --> 04:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
but I believe you that that is a a
 
04:21:07.750 --> 04:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
treatment and that does apply um to uh
 
04:21:10.109 --> 04:21:10.119 align:start position:0%
babies who just had part of their body
 
04:21:13.269 --> 04:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
removed for no reason um I will say that
 
04:21:15.830 --> 04:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
I do we brought up the term medically
 
04:21:17.990 --> 04:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
necessary I think that's an actual good
 
04:21:19.269 --> 04:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
thing because it's determined by the
 
04:21:22.030 --> 04:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
doctor and I don't know how saying that
 
04:21:23.429 --> 04:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
it's up to the doctor whether or not
 
04:21:25.109 --> 04:21:25.119 align:start position:0%
it's medically necessary I don't know
 
04:21:26.630 --> 04:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
how that's being a bad thing it's I
 
04:21:28.030 --> 04:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
think it's a very good thing that the
 
04:21:29.830 --> 04:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
doctor is the one determining whether
 
04:21:31.910 --> 04:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's medically
 
04:21:34.990 --> 04:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
necessary other
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:53.990 --> 04:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:56.389 --> 04:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
Evans and again ma'am you've asked for
 
04:21:57.790 --> 04:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
five minutes if you could keep it to
 
04:21:59.469 --> 04:21:59.479 align:start position:0%
three I'd appreciate
 
04:22:02.510 --> 04:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
it hello thank you for this opportunity
 
04:22:05.349 --> 04:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
dear esteem committee members I urge you
 
04:22:08.469 --> 04:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
to support this bill for 40 years I have
 
04:22:10.590 --> 04:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
been educating health professionals and
 
04:22:12.510 --> 04:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
parents on the functions of the four
 
04:22:15.750 --> 04:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
forkin what is lost when a boy is cired
 
04:22:20.109 --> 04:22:20.119 align:start position:0%
and forkin care why in the mid 80s
 
04:22:22.349 --> 04:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
before becoming a mother I was teaching
 
04:22:24.189 --> 04:22:24.199 align:start position:0%
parents to massage their babies and
 
04:22:26.910 --> 04:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
training professionals to do this work
 
04:22:29.309 --> 04:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
to promote my work I exhibited at a
 
04:22:32.389 --> 04:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
health fair where Dr Robert Mendelson
 
04:22:35.910 --> 04:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
was speaking an orthodox pediatrician
 
04:22:38.790 --> 04:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
from the University of Chicago he is one
 
04:22:40.710 --> 04:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
of the few doctors who spoke of the
 
04:22:43.070 --> 04:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
medical myths of circumcision
 
04:22:46.109 --> 04:22:46.119 align:start position:0%
in his book he wrote quote if your
 
04:22:48.109 --> 04:22:48.119 align:start position:0%
doctor suggests circumcision for your
 
04:22:51.469 --> 04:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
baby boy ask him why he wants to expose
 
04:22:54.269 --> 04:22:54.279 align:start position:0%
the poor kid to the pain the possibility
 
04:22:56.670 --> 04:22:56.680 align:start position:0%
of infections or Hemorrhage and the risk
 
04:22:58.710 --> 04:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
of death from surgery that has no
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
medical justification unquote I found
 
04:23:06.109 --> 04:23:06.119 align:start position:0%
this info disturbing no one in my family
 
04:23:10.469 --> 04:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to discuss this being Jewish and
 
04:23:13.550 --> 04:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
obedient I was torn
 
04:23:15.950 --> 04:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
my work was to ensure nurturing peaceful
 
04:23:18.990 --> 04:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
Beginnings for newborns so I could not
 
04:23:23.309 --> 04:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
ignore it I needed to research more once
 
04:23:27.189 --> 04:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
pregnant my maternal Instinct empowered
 
04:23:30.189 --> 04:23:30.199 align:start position:0%
me most people do not realize that the
 
04:23:32.429 --> 04:23:32.439 align:start position:0%
foreskin protects the glands like the
 
04:23:34.950 --> 04:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
eyelid protects the eyeball if the
 
04:23:36.830 --> 04:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
eyelid were removed the eye would no
 
04:23:38.670 --> 04:23:38.680 align:start position:0%
longer be moist and there would be no
 
04:23:41.790 --> 04:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
moving part I learned that the foreskin
 
04:23:43.309 --> 04:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
is attached to to the glands like the
 
04:23:45.429 --> 04:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
nail to the nail bed and before it is
 
04:23:47.510 --> 04:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
removed it must be
 
04:23:49.990 --> 04:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
detached four Skins are used to make
 
04:23:52.469 --> 04:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
derap patch for burn victims and added
 
04:23:55.109 --> 04:23:55.119 align:start position:0%
to cosmetic creams though neither the
 
04:23:57.630 --> 04:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
infant nor his parents get money for
 
04:24:00.269 --> 04:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
this last year while watching the video
 
04:24:02.750 --> 04:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
from this legislative body I heard a man
 
04:24:05.830 --> 04:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
speak about being cired as an adult most
 
04:24:08.510 --> 04:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
of these cirks are unnecessary I
 
04:24:11.790 --> 04:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
recently learned of a 79-year-old intact
 
04:24:14.510 --> 04:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
man who had a persistent rash and was
 
04:24:17.550 --> 04:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
scheduled for circumcision we informed
 
04:24:20.950 --> 04:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
him to to apply liquid acidophilus the
 
04:24:23.830 --> 04:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
rash disappeared and the surgery was
 
04:24:26.189 --> 04:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
cancelled a couple told me a doctor
 
04:24:28.429 --> 04:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
recommended a circumcision for their
 
04:24:30.990 --> 04:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
adolescent son because his foreskin
 
04:24:33.510 --> 04:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't retracting some boys do not
 
04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
retract until puberty this is normal no
 
04:24:38.950 --> 04:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
medical profession should be attempting
 
04:24:42.469 --> 04:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
to retract the the boy
 
04:24:44.550 --> 04:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
and they did not allow the circumcision
 
04:24:47.670 --> 04:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
after getting information from me as the
 
04:24:49.830 --> 04:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
founder of Noir New York Hudson Valley
 
04:24:53.189 --> 04:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
and co- director for 19 years I often
 
04:24:55.550 --> 04:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
exhibited at large baby fairs where I
 
04:24:59.189 --> 04:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
heard many stories mothers who told me
 
04:25:01.389 --> 04:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
their son's circumcision having not been
 
04:25:03.990 --> 04:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
given information beforehand was their
 
04:25:06.790 --> 04:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
worst nightmare one mother told me her
 
04:25:10.630 --> 04:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
2-year-old was in pain every day how can
 
04:25:13.469 --> 04:25:13.479 align:start position:0%
I help to end this needless pain and
 
04:25:16.149 --> 04:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
suffering although the bill is not about
 
04:25:18.990 --> 04:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
circumcision for religious reasons it is
 
04:25:20.870 --> 04:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
important to share that I am a Jewish
 
04:25:23.750 --> 04:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
mother with an intact son I live by
 
04:25:27.189 --> 04:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
first Do no harm I tell people my son's
 
04:25:30.189 --> 04:25:30.199 align:start position:0%
religion is in his heart his soul and
 
04:25:33.510 --> 04:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
not in his genitals by his deeds and his
 
04:25:35.670 --> 04:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
relationships I have searched for a
 
04:25:39.950 --> 04:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
group that supports Jewish life without
 
04:25:42.510 --> 04:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
circumcising I please one more minute
 
04:25:44.550 --> 04:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
I've got to finish this I'm a member of

circumcision due to my work I have heard
 
04:25:57.269 --> 04:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
men negatively impacted by this in
 
04:25:57.279 --> 04:25:58.590 align:start position:0%
men negatively impacted by this in
November

04:26:01.790 --> 04:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
20124 in New York I saw the guy who got
 
04:26:04.149 --> 04:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
cut wrong the true story of Gary
 
04:26:07.469 --> 04:26:07.479 align:start position:0%
steinhart's botch circumcision he also
 
04:26:10.189 --> 04:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
wrote an article in the New Yorker due
 
04:26:12.790 --> 04:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
to the C during the Q&amp;A he shared that
 
04:26:15.429 --> 04:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
men have contacted him to vent their
 
04:26:18.349 --> 04:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
botch circumcision stories and the pain
 
04:26:21.030 --> 04:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
lifelong pain and suffering it has
 
04:26:23.870 --> 04:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
caused some speakers will argue that not
 
04:26:25.870 --> 04:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
allowing Medicaid coverage deprives
 
04:26:28.950 --> 04:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
low-income family in reality it spares
 
04:26:31.269 --> 04:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
more inference from suffering and a
 
04:26:34.269 --> 04:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
lifetime of reduced sexual function I
 
04:26:36.910 --> 04:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
just want to say too as a long-term
 
04:26:40.590 --> 04:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
Advocate sometimes we do bills I would
 
04:26:42.550 --> 04:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
like to have seen last year's bill bill
 
04:26:45.670 --> 04:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
passed on informing parents beforehand
 
04:26:49.070 --> 04:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
but that didn't pass and so we're here
 
04:26:51.710 --> 04:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
to do something I say let's get this
 
04:26:54.149 --> 04:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
bill passed so that less boys and the
 
04:26:56.429 --> 04:26:56.439 align:start position:0%
men they become suffer thank you thank
 
04:27:00.070 --> 04:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
you any questions yes representative
 
04:27:02.469 --> 04:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:27:05.630 --> 04:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so you said that
 
04:27:08.950 --> 04:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
some boys do not retract until puberty
 
04:27:12.349 --> 04:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
is it your position that even if they do
 
04:27:15.710 --> 04:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
not retract it's still easier to to wash
 
04:27:19.429 --> 04:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
the pot and keep it uh clean and healthy
 
04:27:22.469 --> 04:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
the forest skin protects the glands and
 
04:27:25.710 --> 04:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
so there a lot of doctors tell parents
 
04:27:27.990 --> 04:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
to retract it to wash but we just say
 
04:27:30.590 --> 04:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
clean what is seen so there's no problem
 
04:27:33.229 --> 04:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
in keeping clean and there is a minor
 
04:27:35.990 --> 04:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
procedure to be done if as an adult the
 
04:27:38.389 --> 04:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
man is still not retracting but it does
 
04:27:42.389 --> 04:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
not involve circumcision
 
04:27:42.399 --> 04:27:46.550 align:start position:0%
not involve circumcision
other

04:27:46.550 --> 04:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:49.349 --> 04:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
questions you okay go ahead
 
04:27:51.389 --> 04:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
representative n Mr chairman thanks for
 
04:27:53.429 --> 04:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
taking my questions you you seem to have
 
04:27:56.429 --> 04:27:56.439 align:start position:0%
some expertise about the history of this
 
04:27:58.429 --> 04:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
why did people ever start doing this in
 
04:28:00.990 --> 04:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
the first place do you know I think that
 
04:28:04.309 --> 04:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
um representative soti gave out a a
 
04:28:07.070 --> 04:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
handout that I shared with him this was
 
04:28:08.070 --> 04:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:28:12.269 --> 04:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
medical um journals I read them again
 
04:28:15.550 --> 04:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
few nights ago and I was quivering it
 
04:28:19.710 --> 04:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
said that in order to reduce
 
04:28:22.550 --> 04:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
masturbation to inflict pain it
 
04:28:24.910 --> 04:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
specifically says this throughout the
 
04:28:28.750 --> 04:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
years the goal was to inflict pain to do
 
04:28:32.469 --> 04:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
the procedure without anesthesia because
 
04:28:35.550 --> 04:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
what happens when a boy is retracting he
 
04:28:37.830 --> 04:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
he will begin to do that himself that's
 
04:28:40.309 --> 04:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
a natural occurrence like someone else
 
04:28:42.790 --> 04:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
said every male mammal has a force skin
 
04:28:45.710 --> 04:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing wrong with that so
 
04:28:48.950 --> 04:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
um but during the Victorian era they
 
04:28:50.910 --> 04:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
thought that masturbation caused
 
04:28:53.469 --> 04:28:53.479 align:start position:0%
epilepsy hair on your palms and we
 
04:28:55.590 --> 04:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
actually had a woman because every four
 
04:28:58.070 --> 04:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
years we had an event with doctors
 
04:29:00.429 --> 04:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
lawyers men who were botched everybody
 
04:29:03.309 --> 04:29:03.319 align:start position:0%
gets together we have medical textbooks
 
04:29:07.389 --> 04:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
and um I lost my train of thought oh a
 
04:29:10.389 --> 04:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
woman until I think it was the 70s I'd
 
04:29:12.790 --> 04:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
have to verify the year she was caught
 
04:29:15.189 --> 04:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
masturbating by her parents and taken to
 
04:29:17.309 --> 04:29:17.319 align:start position:0%
be circumcised this was done to women
 
04:29:21.550 --> 04:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
back then they wanted to inflict
 
04:29:23.950 --> 04:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
pain thank you any other questions
 
04:29:25.790 --> 04:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative TZ
 
04:29:27.950 --> 04:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:29:31.030 --> 04:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um thank you you
 
04:29:33.990 --> 04:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh have a lot of uh perspective on this
 
04:29:35.030 --> 04:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like you might have
 
04:29:37.469 --> 04:29:37.479 align:start position:0%
knowledge at a national level have there
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
been efforts um to influence the AAP the
 
04:29:44.269 --> 04:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
American Academy pet itions or insurers
 
04:29:46.149 --> 04:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
like not just Medicaid in New Hampshire
 
04:29:48.109 --> 04:29:48.119 align:start position:0%
but just insurers in general because it
 
04:29:51.309 --> 04:29:51.319 align:start position:0%
seems like that would be if if it if the
 
04:29:53.790 --> 04:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
goal is to have it essentially banned
 
04:29:55.429 --> 04:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
except for you know exceptional
 
04:29:57.189 --> 04:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances it seems like that would
 
04:29:59.189 --> 04:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
be the place to be making the efforts
 
04:30:00.790 --> 04:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question we have
 
04:30:05.070 --> 04:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
tried nationally to get um equal and
 
04:30:07.269 --> 04:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
because now that it's ban for women to
 
04:30:10.790 --> 04:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
get um equal legislation on that issue
 
04:30:12.750 --> 04:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
we used to have booths because we have a
 
04:30:15.149 --> 04:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
group doctors opposing circumcision and
 
04:30:17.389 --> 04:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
the National Organization circumcision
 
04:30:20.469 --> 04:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
information Resource Centers um that has
 
04:30:22.510 --> 04:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
now merged with intact America but they
 
04:30:25.030 --> 04:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
used to have booths at the American
 
04:30:27.389 --> 04:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
Academy of pediatrics at the American
 
04:30:29.950 --> 04:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
Medical Student Association events
 
04:30:32.269 --> 04:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
interestingly and I was shocked by this
 
04:30:35.550 --> 04:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
the obies the Obstetricians do I believe
 
04:30:38.349 --> 04:30:38.359 align:start position:0%
maybe someone can verify that do they
 
04:30:40.750 --> 04:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
were doing at least half of the
 
04:30:43.070 --> 04:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
circumcisions why why they do that on a
 
04:30:45.309 --> 04:30:45.319 align:start position:0%
boy and they would not let us have an
 
04:30:47.189 --> 04:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
exhibit at their events so we would
 
04:30:50.070 --> 04:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
stand outside and I still remember we
 
04:30:53.030 --> 04:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
were there our the signs one of the
 
04:30:55.590 --> 04:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
signs said must this be a boy's first
 
04:30:58.229 --> 04:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
sexual experience and to the doctors do
 
04:31:01.830 --> 04:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
your hands harm or heal but a Jewish
 
04:31:04.189 --> 04:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
doctor walked by and screamed at us it's
 
04:31:08.269 --> 04:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
in the Old Testament and um and it's my
 
04:31:10.590 --> 04:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
religion and the man next to me said I
 
04:31:13.229 --> 04:31:13.239 align:start position:0%
was circumcised by a Jewish doctor in a
 
04:31:15.030 --> 04:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
Catholic Hospital and I'm neither of
 
04:31:17.590 --> 04:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
those religions and I feel as a Jewish
 
04:31:20.109 --> 04:31:20.119 align:start position:0%
woman one of the things I can say is the
 
04:31:22.830 --> 04:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
the committee at the AAP the
 
04:31:26.269 --> 04:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
Pediatric um organization they're often
 
04:31:29.630 --> 04:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
Jewish people and so I'm very grateful
 
04:31:32.990 --> 04:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
to bruhe because bruhe is trying to get
 
04:31:35.710 --> 04:31:35.720 align:start position:0%
it used to be we were under the radar Dr
 
04:31:38.510 --> 04:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
Ron Goldman in Massachusetts has a list
 
04:31:40.830 --> 04:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
of thousands of Jewish couples who did
 
04:31:43.429 --> 04:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
not circumcise Sons but we didn't want
 
04:31:45.710 --> 04:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
to tell anyone because we would often
 
04:31:47.950 --> 04:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
feel that we wouldn't be accepted in our
 
04:31:50.149 --> 04:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
communities and so now we have an
 
04:31:53.229 --> 04:31:53.239 align:start position:0%
organization that is working to get us
 
04:31:56.349 --> 04:31:56.359 align:start position:0%
accepted that we are still I was not
 
04:31:58.070 --> 04:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
looking for Jews who had abandoned the
 
04:32:00.750 --> 04:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
religion I wanted to be my religion but
 
04:32:03.469 --> 04:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to harm my son hope that
 
04:32:06.910 --> 04:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
answers some of the questions other
 
04:32:08.950 --> 04:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
questions yeah I'm seeing none thank you
 
04:32:15.590 --> 04:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:18.790 --> 04:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Joseph Harter
 
04:32:29.750 --> 04:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:32.109 --> 04:32:32.119 align:start position:0%
community good afternoon uh Mr
 
04:32:34.469 --> 04:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
chairperson and members of the committee
 
04:32:37.070 --> 04:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
my name is uh Dr Joseph Harter and I'm a
 
04:32:39.710 --> 04:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
general surgery resident physician I'm
 
04:32:42.269 --> 04:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
here today to speak in support of this
 
04:32:44.870 --> 04:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
bill every physician who performs a
 
04:32:46.910 --> 04:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
surgery has sworn to uphold the
 
04:32:49.870 --> 04:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
hypocritic oath which emphasizes first
 
04:32:53.510 --> 04:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
Do no harm and to avoid overtreatment
 
04:32:55.229 --> 04:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
the non- therapeutic circumcision of
 
04:32:58.189 --> 04:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
minors fundamentally contradicts these
 
04:33:00.229 --> 04:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
principles the surgery is typically
 
04:33:02.590 --> 04:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
performed within infant's first days of
 
04:33:04.429 --> 04:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
life and it's during this vulnerable
 
04:33:06.910 --> 04:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
period that the majority of parents have
 
04:33:08.590 --> 04:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
their initial discussion with a
 
04:33:11.789 --> 04:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
physician about circumcision and parents
 
04:33:14.070 --> 04:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
often face undue solicitation to pursue
 
04:33:16.869 --> 04:33:16.879 align:start position:0%
the surgery particularly those who chose
 
04:33:19.269 --> 04:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
to keep their child intact
 
04:33:21.150 --> 04:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
consequentially the decision is largely
 
04:33:23.789 --> 04:33:23.799 align:start position:0%
based on cosmetic preferences rather
 
04:33:25.551 --> 04:33:25.561 align:start position:0%
than an informed evaluation of the
 
04:33:27.551 --> 04:33:27.561 align:start position:0%
Practical risk and benefits of the
 
04:33:29.390 --> 04:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
surgery now one of the greatest
 
04:33:31.830 --> 04:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of a surgeon is knowing
 
04:33:35.230 --> 04:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
when not to operate as every surgery
 
04:33:38.269 --> 04:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
inevitably causes harm this judgment
 
04:33:40.269 --> 04:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
requires a thorough understanding of the
 
04:33:42.590 --> 04:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
condition being addressed to avoid
 
04:33:44.470 --> 04:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
overtreatment and deliver level
 
04:33:46.789 --> 04:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
appropriate care in a case of non-
 
04:33:49.269 --> 04:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
therapeutic circumcision there is no
 
04:33:52.109 --> 04:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
pathology being addressed this bill
 
04:33:54.070 --> 04:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
excels at avoiding harmful overt
 
04:33:56.070 --> 04:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
treatment and highlighting medically
 
04:33:59.150 --> 04:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
indicated reasons for circumcision when
 
04:34:01.629 --> 04:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
these practices are upheld studies shows
 
04:34:03.990 --> 04:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
the lifetime incidence requiring surgery
 
04:34:06.551 --> 04:34:06.561 align:start position:0%
is only 1 to 2% this is because there
 
04:34:09.750 --> 04:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
are far more effective and less invasive
 
04:34:12.551 --> 04:34:12.561 align:start position:0%
alternatives for each potential benefit
 
04:34:12.561 --> 04:34:13.390 align:start position:0%
alternatives for each potential benefit
of

04:34:13.390 --> 04:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:34:15.349 --> 04:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
circumcision now policy statements from
 
04:34:16.949 --> 04:34:16.959 align:start position:0%
medical organizations such as American
 
04:34:18.990 --> 04:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
Academy of Pediatrics heavily influenced
 
04:34:21.551 --> 04:34:21.561 align:start position:0%
providers and parents however the aap's
 
04:34:23.349 --> 04:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
policy statement on circumcision
 
04:34:25.949 --> 04:34:25.959 align:start position:0%
intentionally expired 7 years ago
 
04:34:27.830 --> 04:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
currently no medical organization
 
04:34:30.269 --> 04:34:30.279 align:start position:0%
recommends this surgery on healthy
 
04:34:32.470 --> 04:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
children existing legislation

uh well is is that appropriate if this
 
04:36:13.629 --> 04:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
gentleman is speaking as an
 
04:36:15.590 --> 04:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
individual are you're not representing
 
04:36:17.910 --> 04:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
any I'm representing myself and um the
 
04:36:20.510 --> 04:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
training that I've received and um my
 
04:36:23.189 --> 04:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
experience working with patients okay

thanks I I get that I see okay so be I

just normally when we have something
 
04:36:30.910 --> 04:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
that they're representing there has been
 
04:36:33.551 --> 04:36:33.561 align:start position:0%
an author it's it's an recognized
 
04:36:36.189 --> 04:36:36.199 align:start position:0%
organization with an authorization and I
 
04:36:38.470 --> 04:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to make the distinction clear and
 
04:36:40.349 --> 04:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
I understand you are speaking not only
 
04:36:42.070 --> 04:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
for yourself but those
 
04:36:45.510 --> 04:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
who um follow the same guidelines but I
 
04:36:47.429 --> 04:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to make it clear that it wasn't
 
04:36:51.390 --> 04:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
any recognized correct organization
 
04:36:54.910 --> 04:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative palazov thank
 
04:36:57.189 --> 04:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:37:01.349 --> 04:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
question so in general uh like uh a
 
04:37:05.709 --> 04:37:05.719 align:start position:0%
doctor uh can a doctor decide uh not to
 
04:37:09.551 --> 04:37:09.561 align:start position:0%
perform certain surgeries and is there a
 
04:37:14.390 --> 04:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
risk of backlash from Administration or
 
04:37:16.670 --> 04:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
facility where it's happening or some
 
04:37:19.390 --> 04:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
other difficulty with deciding not to
 
04:37:23.029 --> 04:37:23.039 align:start position:0%
perform certain medically unnecessary
 
04:37:25.510 --> 04:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
surgeries certainly so that decision is
 
04:37:28.029 --> 04:37:28.039 align:start position:0%
up to um The Physician themselves their
 
04:37:30.310 --> 04:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
obligation is to the patient that they
 
04:37:33.230 --> 04:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
are treating or that they are caring for
 
04:37:35.349 --> 04:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
um in certain organizations um speaking
 
04:37:37.150 --> 04:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
with other um Physicians that I work
 
04:37:39.109 --> 04:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
with there is a lot of pressure that
 
04:37:41.510 --> 04:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
they continue to perform this surgery
 
04:37:43.990 --> 04:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
but increasing so more Physicians
 
04:37:47.189 --> 04:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
recognizing the um the increasing um
 
04:37:49.551 --> 04:37:49.561 align:start position:0%
literature supporting that there's um
 
04:37:52.510 --> 04:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
pronounced long and short-term risk are
 
04:37:54.429 --> 04:37:54.439 align:start position:0%
refusing to perform the surgery but
 
04:37:57.310 --> 04:37:57.320 align:start position:0%
there are Physicians um willing to do so
 
04:38:00.990 --> 04:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
follow up uh thank you for uh allowing
 
04:38:05.869 --> 04:38:05.879 align:start position:0%
me to follow up um my my second question
 
04:38:08.590 --> 04:38:08.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh is
 
04:38:18.189 --> 04:38:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:22.990 --> 04:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
it sorry I lost it okay okay thank you
 
04:38:25.551 --> 04:38:25.561 align:start position:0%
representative TZ thank you Mr chairman
 
04:38:27.590 --> 04:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
04:38:29.629 --> 04:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
apologize I could you repeat your
 
04:38:32.629 --> 04:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
specialty and then if you know how many
 
04:38:34.590 --> 04:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
circumcisions you've done or how you're
 
04:38:36.230 --> 04:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
trained to do it like if that's your
 
04:38:38.830 --> 04:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
area correct certainly so my um
 
04:38:40.670 --> 04:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
specialty is general surgery essentially
 
04:38:42.349 --> 04:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
everything below the neck excluding the
 
04:38:44.990 --> 04:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
bones and the nervous system um with
 
04:38:46.750 --> 04:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
Testament to training reflecting back in
 
04:38:49.109 --> 04:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
my medical school and residency um
 
04:38:51.590 --> 04:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
education now one second was spent on
 
04:38:53.949 --> 04:38:53.959 align:start position:0%
the education of this part of the body
 
04:38:56.629 --> 04:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
the natural um function of the forest
 
04:38:58.510 --> 04:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
skin in terms of whether or not I
 
04:39:00.269 --> 04:39:00.279 align:start position:0%
perform a surgery myself like many of my
 
04:39:02.310 --> 04:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
colleagues I work with refuse to perform
 
04:39:04.189 --> 04:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
the surgery unless if there is a medical
 
04:39:06.470 --> 04:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
indication and un less of um for those
 
04:39:08.789 --> 04:39:08.799 align:start position:0%
medical indications less invasive and
 
04:39:10.510 --> 04:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
more effective treatments have been
 
04:39:14.390 --> 04:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:16.310 --> 04:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
04:39:19.150 --> 04:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
questions representative paza uh thank
 
04:39:23.390 --> 04:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh I wonder if uh a
 
04:39:28.429 --> 04:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
physician or news helping physician have
 
04:39:32.551 --> 04:39:32.561 align:start position:0%
enough time uh uh to inform patients
 
04:39:37.270 --> 04:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
about uh this procedure why why they
 
04:39:39.750 --> 04:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
believe it's not medically necessary and
 
04:39:42.070 --> 04:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
what could be complication
 
04:39:46.070 --> 04:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh because uh we want inform consent but
 
04:39:49.470 --> 04:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
like I feel often like it's just a
 
04:39:53.030 --> 04:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
checkbox under pressure and there's no
 
04:39:57.030 --> 04:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
time maybe to uh deliver information
 
04:39:59.948 --> 04:39:59.958 align:start position:0%
certainly I re uh recently concluded a
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
two-year study at a major academic U
 
04:40:04.788 --> 04:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
Medical Center um assessing just that
 
04:40:07.030 --> 04:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
question then form consent practices
 
04:40:09.590 --> 04:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
regarding specifically the surgery as
 
04:40:10.830 --> 04:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
briefly mentioned the majority of
 
04:40:12.230 --> 04:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
parents and fortunately first time
 
04:40:14.708 --> 04:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
discussing this topic with a physician
 
04:40:17.150 --> 04:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
is in an opportune period after birth
 
04:40:19.430 --> 04:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
this is a period where parents are tired
 
04:40:21.230 --> 04:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
they're overwhelmed and there's a lot of
 
04:40:24.110 --> 04:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
commotion it is not an ideal time to
 
04:40:25.990 --> 04:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
undergo these
 
04:40:28.390 --> 04:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
conversations um further um the
 
04:40:31.670 --> 04:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
conversations that are conducted um are
 
04:40:35.270 --> 04:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
very superficial uh you they do not do
 
04:40:38.070 --> 04:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh Deep dive into the true benefits and
 
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
risk both short and long um term parents
 
04:40:43.030 --> 04:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
are solicited for this particular if you
 
04:40:46.550 --> 04:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
do not have the surgery done um at our
 
04:40:49.830 --> 04:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
institution um the average for uh family
 
04:40:51.670 --> 04:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
who decided not to have the surgery done
 
04:40:54.350 --> 04:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
they were asked four times after birth
 
04:40:56.270 --> 04:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
and before Hospital discharge do you
 
04:40:58.550 --> 04:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
want to have the surgery done imagine
 
04:40:59.788 --> 04:40:59.798 align:start position:0%
that you are sitting there you are
 
04:41:02.150 --> 04:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
disted you are tired with a beautiful
 
04:41:04.070 --> 04:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
healthy child and you keep on getting
 
04:41:05.788 --> 04:41:05.798 align:start position:0%
asked do you want the surgery do you
 
04:41:07.788 --> 04:41:07.798 align:start position:0%
want this surgery and you keep on saying
 
04:41:09.070 --> 04:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
knowing your decision is not being
 
04:41:11.310 --> 04:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
respected that solicitation that was
 
04:41:13.230 --> 04:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
ceron for Unnecessary medical
 
04:41:15.070 --> 04:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
intervention and some Hospital
 
04:41:16.430 --> 04:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
organizations including the one that I
 
04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
work at and one that I did research at
 
04:41:20.670 --> 04:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
they have check boxes to ensure that
 
04:41:23.470 --> 04:41:23.480 align:start position:0%
parents are asked this
 
04:41:26.390 --> 04:41:26.400 align:start position:0%

04:41:53.240 --> 04:41:55.110 align:start position:0%
elective
stuff

04:41:55.110 --> 04:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
04:41:57.868 --> 04:41:57.878 align:start position:0%
um you're implying that patients are
 
04:41:59.550 --> 04:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
told at the last minute that they're
 
04:42:01.628 --> 04:42:01.638 align:start position:0%
going to have a circumcision but they've
 
04:42:04.310 --> 04:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
known they were pregnant for 6 to n
 
04:42:04.320 --> 04:42:06.150 align:start position:0%
known they were pregnant for 6 to n
months

04:42:06.150 --> 04:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
months
 
04:42:08.708 --> 04:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
um are you saying that these discussions
 
04:42:11.430 --> 04:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
aren't going on before that correct so
 
04:42:13.350 --> 04:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
the majority of parents in our study um
 
04:42:15.910 --> 04:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
was initially around 55% their first
 
04:42:18.030 --> 04:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
time discussing this topic with a
 
04:42:21.150 --> 04:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
physician was after birth and before
 
04:42:23.190 --> 04:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
Hospital discharge this is representing
 
04:42:26.830 --> 04:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
328 parental survery responses so I have
 
04:42:28.910 --> 04:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
a f follow up are you suggesting that
 
04:42:31.310 --> 04:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
the parents were unaware before that
 
04:42:33.868 --> 04:42:33.878 align:start position:0%
that this was even an option um they
 
04:42:35.990 --> 04:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
aware that it is an option one of our
 
04:42:39.230 --> 04:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
key duties as U um as Physicians is to
 
04:42:42.110 --> 04:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
obtain informed consent largely with
 
04:42:44.590 --> 04:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
that um we have parental care classes we
 
04:42:46.830 --> 04:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
have um prenatal sonography Clinic these
 
04:42:49.150 --> 04:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
are key opportunities for um Physicians
 
04:42:51.110 --> 04:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
to be engaged but they are not being
 
04:42:54.788 --> 04:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:57.430 --> 04:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
discussions other discussion have any
 
04:42:57.440 --> 04:42:58.910 align:start position:0%
discussions other discussion have any

other
 
04:43:01.948 --> 04:43:01.958 align:start position:0%

.org hello so I'm going to tell you a
 
04:43:19.910 --> 04:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of my life story within three

minutes okay thank you um uh uh my life
 
04:43:26.430 --> 04:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
experience as a victim of
 
04:43:29.788 --> 04:43:29.798 align:start position:0%
circumcision We Exist we should be
 
04:43:35.310 --> 04:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
considered in these um decisions to be
 
04:43:35.320 --> 04:43:38.750 align:start position:0%
considered in these um decisions to be
made

04:43:38.750 --> 04:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:42.230 --> 04:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh when I was young I was sexually
 
04:43:45.510 --> 04:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
assaulted by a Southern Baptist preacher
 
04:43:47.708 --> 04:43:47.718 align:start position:0%
years later I was assaulted by a
 
04:43:50.310 --> 04:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
Catholic priest at the Jesuit Seminary
 
04:43:52.830 --> 04:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
and Mission Bureau in New York
 
04:43:57.270 --> 04:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
City both men used their power over me
 
04:44:01.070 --> 04:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
neither felt that I owned my own body
 
04:44:04.430 --> 04:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
these men violated my body in a
 
04:44:07.070 --> 04:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
disgusting attack but they didn't leave
 
04:44:11.270 --> 04:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
a mark on me by far the worst violation
 
04:44:15.270 --> 04:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
of my body was the man who circumcised
 
04:44:18.830 --> 04:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
me the other attacks I rarely have
 
04:44:21.750 --> 04:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
anything to remind me but every day when
 
04:44:24.628 --> 04:44:24.638 align:start position:0%
I urinate I have to look at a big scar
 
04:44:25.708 --> 04:44:25.718 align:start position:0%
on my
 
04:44:28.910 --> 04:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
penis uh I also suffer from meatal
 
04:44:31.708 --> 04:44:31.718 align:start position:0%
stenosis which makes peeing painful at
 
04:44:35.390 --> 04:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
times I have uh several skin
 
04:44:38.788 --> 04:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
Bridges uh every time I have sex I'm
 
04:44:42.190 --> 04:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
reminded that my body was downg graded
 
04:44:45.030 --> 04:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
by someone who never gave me another
 
04:44:49.190 --> 04:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
thought what he did to me is a permanent
 
04:44:52.590 --> 04:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
irreversible unforgivable life sentence
 
04:44:56.390 --> 04:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
that I will take to the Grave lastly I
 
04:44:59.708 --> 04:44:59.718 align:start position:0%
would like to say to doctors with so
 
04:45:03.868 --> 04:45:03.878 align:start position:0%
many people finding out every day that
 
04:45:08.070 --> 04:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
you have performed a painful cosmetic
 
04:45:11.070 --> 04:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
procedure on them at their most
 
04:45:15.350 --> 04:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
vulnerable moment in life saying your
 
04:45:17.948 --> 04:45:17.958 align:start position:0%
parents told me
 
04:45:21.830 --> 04:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
to as if you were forced to and you bear
 
04:45:21.840 --> 04:45:22.708 align:start position:0%
to as if you were forced to and you bear
no

04:45:22.708 --> 04:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:45:25.628 --> 04:45:25.638 align:start position:0%
responsibility saying your parents told
 
04:45:30.750 --> 04:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
me to is simply no longer valid uh I am
 
04:45:33.430 --> 04:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill and uh thank you
 
04:45:33.440 --> 04:45:34.550 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill and uh thank you
for

04:45:34.550 --> 04:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:45:36.550 --> 04:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
listening thank
 
04:45:41.470 --> 04:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:46.910 --> 04:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:53.948 --> 04:45:53.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:56.708 --> 04:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
Adler you've got uh five minutes down to
 
04:45:58.830 --> 04:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
include questions and answers so if your
 
04:46:00.470 --> 04:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
testimony can just be free that' be
 
04:46:03.830 --> 04:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
great thank you sir uh good afternoon
 
04:46:06.590 --> 04:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
esteemed legislators I'm Peter Adler
 
04:46:09.190 --> 04:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
from the Flatland of Massachusetts I'm
 
04:46:11.788 --> 04:46:11.798 align:start position:0%
an expert in circumcision ision and the
 
04:46:14.550 --> 04:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
law and I believe I can help you decide
 
04:46:17.948 --> 04:46:17.958 align:start position:0%
this matter uh it's a matter of law not
 
04:46:21.868 --> 04:46:21.878 align:start position:0%
of policy what I'm going to
 
04:46:25.110 --> 04:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
show as I showed in a 2011 article it's
 
04:46:28.230 --> 04:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
unlawful for Physicians to use Medicaid
 
04:46:30.628 --> 04:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
to pay for circumcision and it's
 
04:46:33.390 --> 04:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
unlawful for states to allow them to do
 
04:46:36.350 --> 04:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
that um so hopefully we've persuaded you
 
04:46:38.030 --> 04:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
today that the for skin of the penis is
 
04:46:39.868 --> 04:46:39.878 align:start position:0%
a natural part of the body and a very
 
04:46:41.990 --> 04:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
good thing I'm not sure whether it was
 
04:46:44.030 --> 04:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned it's the most sensitive part
 
04:46:45.910 --> 04:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
of the penis and those who have a for
 
04:46:48.990 --> 04:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
skin do not want to part with it um I
 
04:46:51.350 --> 04:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
hope we've persuaded you that uh
 
04:46:53.670 --> 04:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
Physicians don't normally amputate
 
04:46:56.910 --> 04:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
healthy parts of children's bodies it's
 
04:46:58.830 --> 04:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
inconceivable that they would cut off a
 
04:47:03.070 --> 04:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
finger for example um and uh
 
04:47:05.628 --> 04:47:05.638 align:start position:0%
circumcision it is more accurately gen
 
04:47:08.990 --> 04:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
male genital cutting like female uh uh
 
04:47:11.548 --> 04:47:11.558 align:start position:0%
uh genital cutting um
 
04:47:14.150 --> 04:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
is not medically indicated meaning uh
 
04:47:16.910 --> 04:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
doctors know it's not uh needed or
 
04:47:21.150 --> 04:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
desirable as as people have uh testified
 
04:47:23.830 --> 04:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's extremely painful uh risks more
 
04:47:26.708 --> 04:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
than 50 complications this narrowing of
 
04:47:28.548 --> 04:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
the urethal opening happens in more than
 
04:47:31.190 --> 04:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
15% of cases it can be fatal and it
 
04:47:35.310 --> 04:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
causes psychological harm so um I wrote
 
04:47:37.070 --> 04:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
an article showing it's unlawful for
 
04:47:40.350 --> 04:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
Physicians to perform the operation um
 
04:47:43.150 --> 04:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
the uh doctor said he refuses to perform
 
04:47:46.830 --> 04:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
the operation um most countries doctors
 
04:47:50.110 --> 04:47:50.120 align:start position:0%
uh don't do this um it uh it violates
 
04:47:51.670 --> 04:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
the rights of the child to bodily
 
04:47:54.470 --> 04:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
Integrity self-determination and
 
04:47:57.350 --> 04:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
privacy um and the federal and state
 
04:48:00.510 --> 04:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
equal protection Clause prohibits the
 
04:48:02.830 --> 04:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
state or makes it unlawful for the state
 
04:48:05.190 --> 04:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
to protect girls without extending equal
 
04:48:08.030 --> 04:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
to protection to boys and as somebody
 
04:48:09.830 --> 04:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned um there's a lawyer who's
 
04:48:11.230 --> 04:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
about to bring an equal protection
 
04:48:13.390 --> 04:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
lawsuit in another
 
04:48:16.670 --> 04:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
state um so the claim that circumcision
 
04:48:19.110 --> 04:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
is preventive medicine is false and
 
04:48:21.350 --> 04:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
fraudulent it does not benefit most
 
04:48:23.830 --> 04:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
males at all any benefits can be
 
04:48:26.390 --> 04:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
achieved without it as the doctor said
 
04:48:28.628 --> 04:48:28.638 align:start position:0%
and importantly boys are not at risk of
 
04:48:30.150 --> 04:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
these adult
 
04:48:33.708 --> 04:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
diseases so um it is unlawful for
 
04:48:35.190 --> 04:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
Physicians to build Medicade for
 
04:48:38.070 --> 04:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
Unnecessary circumcision surgery in fact
 
04:48:39.750 --> 04:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
the number one rule of Federal and State
 
04:48:42.670 --> 04:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid law is that this surgery must
 
04:48:45.030 --> 04:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
be medically indicated and medically
 
04:48:47.230 --> 04:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
necessary in order to get paid
 
04:48:49.590 --> 04:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
Physicians lie on the federal and state
 
04:48:52.230 --> 04:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursement form they falsely claim
 
04:48:54.788 --> 04:48:54.798 align:start position:0%
that the surgery is medically indicated
 
04:48:57.350 --> 04:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
and they use false diagnosis these
 
04:48:59.788 --> 04:48:59.798 align:start position:0%
Physicians have been defrauding the
 
04:49:01.750 --> 04:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
children their parents the state and
 
04:49:04.310 --> 04:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers for decades maybe going back
 
04:49:04.320 --> 04:49:05.310 align:start position:0%
taxpayers for decades maybe going back
to

04:49:05.310 --> 04:49:05.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:49:08.510 --> 04:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
1965 and they unjust unjustly enriched
 
04:49:10.910 --> 04:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
themselves the state has been allowing
 
04:49:13.390 --> 04:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
Physicians to get away with fraud New
 
04:49:15.230 --> 04:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not doing its duty to
 
04:49:17.230 --> 04:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
review these payments and coverage and
 
04:49:19.190 --> 04:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
to prosecute these
 
04:49:22.110 --> 04:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
Physicians um I will wrap up because I
 
04:49:24.310 --> 04:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
would like to take your questions and
 
04:49:26.990 --> 04:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
rebut anything that was said also give
 
04:49:28.948 --> 04:49:28.958 align:start position:0%
the definition of medical necessity in
 
04:49:31.510 --> 04:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law I wanted to say that
 
04:49:34.708 --> 04:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
passing this bill will uh uh save boys
 
04:49:37.030 --> 04:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
from these risks and harms allow them to
 
04:49:39.548 --> 04:49:39.558 align:start position:0%
enjoy their bodies as nature intended it

people who need services and avoid
 
04:49:46.470 --> 04:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
lawsuits such as happened in
 
04:49:48.270 --> 04:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts against the state saying
 
04:49:50.510 --> 04:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
it was on unlawful to use Medicaid to
 
04:49:52.788 --> 04:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
pay for circumcision thank you I welcome
 
04:49:54.350 --> 04:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
your questions any questions
 
04:49:57.030 --> 04:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative palazov thank you Mr
 
04:49:58.948 --> 04:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:50:02.430 --> 04:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
question so in your opinion uh what
 
04:50:05.830 --> 04:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
defines medical NE necessity well
 
04:50:08.430 --> 04:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
fortunately I don't need to opine I can
 
04:50:11.190 --> 04:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
cite New Hampshire law hopefully I I
 
04:50:15.350 --> 04:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
have the citation correctly to uh uh Hew
 
04:50:15.360 --> 04:50:41.110 align:start position:0%
have the citation correctly to uh uh Hew
530.11

04:50:41.110 --> 04:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:44.190 --> 04:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
and no more costly or other services are
 
04:50:46.190 --> 04:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
available to provide equivalent
 
04:50:48.830 --> 04:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
treatment results it's not experimental
 
04:50:52.510 --> 04:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
or cosmetic so non-therapeutic VI um
 
04:50:54.670 --> 04:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
circumcision violates every one of those
 
04:50:56.750 --> 04:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
Provisions um it's not medically
 
04:50:58.390 --> 04:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
indicated doctors don't use their
 
04:51:00.548 --> 04:51:00.558 align:start position:0%
medical judgment they take orders from
 
04:51:03.310 --> 04:51:03.320 align:start position:0%
parents to perform this surgery and as
 
04:51:06.030 --> 04:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
has been said um I can attest to it
 
04:51:07.670 --> 04:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
myself I never thought about
 
04:51:10.310 --> 04:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
circumcising my son when my wife gave
 
04:51:11.868 --> 04:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
birth the doctor came in and said have
 
04:51:13.590 --> 04:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
you decided whether to circumcise your
 
04:51:15.750 --> 04:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
son or not I'd never thought it I was
 
04:51:17.948 --> 04:51:17.958 align:start position:0%
taken back and my wife was quote out of
 
04:51:20.030 --> 04:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
it so I was left to make the decision
 
04:51:21.948 --> 04:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
myself she's a doctor and I knew nothing
 
04:51:24.070 --> 04:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
about it and he he told me it's not
 
04:51:26.270 --> 04:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
medically Justified and he said would I
 
04:51:30.390 --> 04:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
like to circumcise my son for um for
 
04:51:32.350 --> 04:51:32.360 align:start position:0%
personal reasons I said what do you mean
 
04:51:34.830 --> 04:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
and he said do you want your son's penis
 
04:51:37.150 --> 04:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
to match your penis so this is the kind
 
04:51:39.350 --> 04:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
of arguments that are insane that
 
04:51:41.670 --> 04:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
doctors are making they really put a
 
04:51:44.910 --> 04:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
full court press on people to U uh to
 
04:51:47.110 --> 04:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
say yes to circumcision and they don't
 
04:51:49.230 --> 04:51:49.240 align:start position:0%
disclose the harms it's a breach of
 
04:51:52.750 --> 04:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty other questions
 
04:51:54.830 --> 04:51:54.840 align:start position:0%

04:52:05.868 --> 04:52:05.878 align:start position:0%

04:54:21.310 --> 04:54:21.320 align:start position:0%
members of the community on this uh
 
04:54:23.948 --> 04:54:23.958 align:start position:0%
beautiful New Hampshire day uh listening
 
04:54:25.708 --> 04:54:25.718 align:start position:0%
to the previous testimony I was trying
 
04:54:28.070 --> 04:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
to decide since many of the points have
 
04:54:29.190 --> 04:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
been already brought up I think I want
 
04:54:32.030 --> 04:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
to put this in the context of the of the
 
04:54:35.788 --> 04:54:35.798 align:start position:0%
medical view of this historically so uh
 
04:54:37.030 --> 04:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
obviously the history of circumcision
 
04:54:39.788 --> 04:54:39.798 align:start position:0%
goes way back uh Egyptian c um
 
04:54:39.798 --> 04:54:41.430 align:start position:0%
goes way back uh Egyptian c um
hieroglyphic

04:54:41.430 --> 04:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
hieroglyphic
 
04:54:43.548 --> 04:54:43.558 align:start position:0%
um but if you look at the Encyclopedia
 
04:54:46.030 --> 04:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
Britannica up until 1860 was always only
 
04:54:48.150 --> 04:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
a cultural and religious practice in
 
04:54:50.868 --> 04:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
1870 that's when you start to see it um
 
04:54:53.230 --> 04:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
become medical of course at the time
 
04:54:54.948 --> 04:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
it's the Victorian era they didn't have
 
04:54:59.150 --> 04:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
a germ theory of medicine they uh uh had
 
04:55:00.910 --> 04:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
all kinds of views
 
04:55:05.470 --> 04:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
about sex that we don't have now uh and
 
04:55:05.480 --> 04:55:07.390 align:start position:0%
about sex that we don't have now uh and
uh

04:55:07.390 --> 04:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:55:10.868 --> 04:55:10.878 align:start position:0%
they uh saw surgery is the answer to
 
04:55:13.628 --> 04:55:13.638 align:start position:0%
everything cuz they didn't have drugs uh
 
04:55:13.638 --> 04:55:17.150 align:start position:0%
everything cuz they didn't have drugs uh
as

04:55:17.150 --> 04:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:20.750 --> 04:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
um as time went on as others have said
 
04:55:23.070 --> 04:55:23.080 align:start position:0%
it became a a disease in search of a
 
04:55:25.670 --> 04:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
cure so it would cure masturbation then
 
04:55:27.350 --> 04:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
it would cure cancer then it would cures
 
04:55:30.910 --> 04:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
peritura which is not a real disease uh
 
04:55:34.270 --> 04:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
and by the middle of the 20th century
 
04:55:36.910 --> 04:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
many of these uh medical benefits had
 
04:55:39.548 --> 04:55:39.558 align:start position:0%
been debunked when the National Health
 
04:55:41.990 --> 04:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh service was up in the UK in 19 in the
 
04:55:45.548 --> 04:55:45.558 align:start position:0%
1940s they uh issued a report uh to look
 
04:55:46.990 --> 04:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
into it to see if if it should be
 
04:55:49.230 --> 04:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
subsidized uh and covered by their
 
04:55:52.670 --> 04:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
National Health Services these were uh
 
04:55:54.628 --> 04:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
came out in the famous uh Garden report
 
04:55:57.470 --> 04:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
in 1949 which said that uh it's not
 
04:55:59.150 --> 04:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
medically Justified and so it was
 
04:56:02.030 --> 04:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
removed the same thing happened in
 
04:56:04.430 --> 04:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
Australia and New Zealand in the 1970s
 
04:56:06.830 --> 04:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
in Canada it's more based on a
 
04:56:10.708 --> 04:56:10.718 align:start position:0%
provincial um uh level so the times in
 
04:56:13.070 --> 04:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
Quebec where about half of New Hampshire
 
04:56:14.390 --> 04:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
people come from Quebec if they trace
 
04:56:16.990 --> 04:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
their An ancestry back never really
 
04:56:20.150 --> 04:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
adopted it um Ontario and the uh
 
04:56:22.990 --> 04:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
prairies basically banned it in the 9s
 
04:56:25.910 --> 04:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the United States uh the country
 
04:56:27.548 --> 04:56:27.558 align:start position:0%
where it achieved the highest
 
04:56:29.830 --> 04:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
rates uh those rates started to come
 
04:56:31.628 --> 04:56:31.638 align:start position:0%
down in the 70s you had the famous Dr
 
04:56:34.390 --> 04:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
Spock who had earlier in the 60s and 70s
 
04:56:37.310 --> 04:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
that advocated uh routine infant
 
04:56:40.070 --> 04:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
circumcision uh changed his tune in in
 
04:56:41.590 --> 04:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
the in the 80s saying that it was no
 
04:56:43.750 --> 04:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
longer necessary and we've had it
 
04:56:46.150 --> 04:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
referred to a couple times now the AAP
 
04:56:48.830 --> 04:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
the AAP is a totally legitimate
 
04:56:51.430 --> 04:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
organization uh we need organizations we
 
04:56:53.070 --> 04:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
need free association of people but they
 
04:56:56.590 --> 04:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
have every in every incentive to have
 
04:56:59.030 --> 04:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
procedures be covered and paid uh
 
04:57:00.590 --> 04:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
they're they're an advocacy
 
04:57:02.830 --> 04:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
organization uh for their members and
 
04:57:04.510 --> 04:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
the more things that they can be paid
 
04:57:07.390 --> 04:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
for the better uh when their last policy
 
04:57:08.910 --> 04:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
statement on this was issued that was in
 
04:57:08.920 --> 04:57:10.510 align:start position:0%
statement on this was issued that was in
2012

04:57:10.510 --> 04:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
2012
 
04:57:13.470 --> 04:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
uh now this was quite a controversial
 
04:57:16.270 --> 04:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
document because they relied heavily on
 
04:57:17.948 --> 04:57:17.958 align:start position:0%
non-medical reasons cultural reasons
 
04:57:19.670 --> 04:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
religious reasons personal reasons
 
04:57:21.670 --> 04:57:21.680 align:start position:0%

room
 
04:57:27.788 --> 04:57:27.798 align:start position:0%
and just to end very very briefly
 
04:57:31.470 --> 04:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
uh that policy expired in 2017 and in
 
04:57:33.030 --> 04:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
the 13 years since then they have not
 
04:57:35.150 --> 04:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
come up with a good reason why it should
 
04:57:37.430 --> 04:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
be justified or covered if this advocacy
 
04:57:38.788 --> 04:57:38.798 align:start position:0%
group can't come up with a good reason
 
04:57:41.270 --> 04:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
to cover it there is no reason the state
 
04:57:43.150 --> 04:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
should be subsidizing something that is
 
04:57:44.670 --> 04:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
not medically necessary as we've well
 
04:57:46.350 --> 04:57:46.360 align:start position:0%
established by other testimony is not
 
04:57:51.910 --> 04:57:51.920 align:start position:0%

3,000 years
 
04:59:13.430 --> 04:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
for nearly all Jews it is not merely a
 
04:59:16.310 --> 04:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
suggestion it is a commandment an
 
04:59:18.310 --> 04:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
obligation a
 
04:59:21.390 --> 04:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
requirement unless medically unsound we
 
04:59:23.910 --> 04:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
circumcise our baby boys on the eth day
 
04:59:27.470 --> 04:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
of life and when it is medically unsound
 
04:59:30.430 --> 04:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
we don't abandon the practice we perform
 
04:59:32.868 --> 04:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
the circumcision when the baby boy is
 
04:59:36.510 --> 04:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
medically ready Muslims too practice the
 
04:59:38.990 --> 04:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
sacred ritual of circumcision on baby
 
04:59:41.990 --> 04:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
boys and usually now on the seventh or
 
04:59:44.590 --> 04:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
Eighth Day of life it was mentioned in
 
04:59:47.430 --> 04:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
prior testimony that it would be before
 
04:59:50.230 --> 04:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
puberty in my speaking with uh a
 
04:59:51.948 --> 04:59:51.958 align:start position:0%
prominent Muslim in our community
 
04:59:54.910 --> 04:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday he assured me that it is done
 
04:59:58.150 --> 04:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
extremely early now um as I indicated
 
04:59:59.948 --> 04:59:59.958 align:start position:0%
seventh or Eighth Day of
 
05:00:02.590 --> 05:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
life this bill as you all know would
 
05:00:04.708 --> 05:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
prohibit the State Medicaid Program from
 
05:00:07.548 --> 05:00:07.558 align:start position:0%
covering circumcision of a minor unless
 
05:00:09.150 --> 05:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
the procedure is deemed medically
 
05:00:12.750 --> 05:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
necessary the bill goes on to list 14
 
05:00:14.708 --> 05:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
medical conditions that would fall into
 
05:00:16.628 --> 05:00:16.638 align:start position:0%
the category of medically medical
 
05:00:19.390 --> 05:00:19.400 align:start position:0%
necessity and then provides the catchall
 
05:00:21.868 --> 05:00:21.878 align:start position:0%
of or any diagnosed condition for which
 
05:00:23.510 --> 05:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
a circumcision is deemed medically
 
05:00:25.990 --> 05:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
necessary by a physician or other health
 
05:00:29.030 --> 05:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
care provider licensed in New Hampshire
 
05:00:31.230 --> 05:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
the bill is called the children's body
 
05:00:31.240 --> 05:00:32.548 align:start position:0%
the bill is called the children's body
autonomy

05:00:32.548 --> 05:00:32.558 align:start position:0%
autonomy
 
05:00:35.510 --> 05:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
act speaks to me seems to me that if the
 
05:00:37.830 --> 05:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
authors and sponsors truly cared about
 
05:00:40.310 --> 05:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
body autonomy they would not includes
 
05:00:42.628 --> 05:00:42.638 align:start position:0%
such a lengthy list of medical
 
05:00:45.030 --> 05:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
exceptions you just leave it to the
 
05:00:47.948 --> 05:00:47.958 align:start position:0%
Judgment of medical providers
 
05:00:50.910 --> 05:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps on reading the bill particularly
 
05:00:52.548 --> 05:00:52.558 align:start position:0%
reading it from the perspective of being
 
05:00:55.270 --> 05:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
a rabbi it feels in many ways that it is
 
05:00:58.070 --> 05:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
targeting the religions Jews and Muslims
 
05:01:00.868 --> 05:01:00.878 align:start position:0%
in particular for a procedure that is
 
05:01:04.150 --> 05:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
ritually demanded and ritually
 
05:01:06.590 --> 05:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
standard this to me is a clear violation
 
05:01:07.948 --> 05:01:07.958 align:start position:0%
of the First Amendment to the
 
05:01:10.390 --> 05:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution as it violates the the free
 
05:01:12.350 --> 05:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
the right of the free exercise of
 
05:01:14.948 --> 05:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
religion as such I urge the members of
 
05:01:17.230 --> 05:01:17.240 align:start position:0%
this committee to vote in expedient to
 
05:01:19.110 --> 05:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you for taking my
 
05:01:21.788 --> 05:01:21.798 align:start position:0%
testimony I do have written copies okay
 
05:01:24.868 --> 05:01:24.878 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much any
 
05:01:27.990 --> 05:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
questions I Y I'm scar representative
 
05:01:30.150 --> 05:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
blows up I apologize that's right uh
 
05:01:32.868 --> 05:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:01:35.750 --> 05:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh could you commment
 
05:01:40.150 --> 05:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
or refute previously received data that
 
05:01:44.590 --> 05:01:44.600 align:start position:0%
in Israel uh percentage of circumcision
 
05:01:48.868 --> 05:01:48.878 align:start position:0%
is going down and uh that allegedly even
 
05:01:52.030 --> 05:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
some religious Jews uh trying to find
 
05:01:54.910 --> 05:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
some alternative to completely cutting
 
05:01:59.390 --> 05:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
the for skin but still uh keeping some
 
05:02:01.310 --> 05:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
part of
 
05:02:04.750 --> 05:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
tradition two two prior people indicated
 
05:02:06.910 --> 05:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
the breach Shalom the the Covenant of
 
05:02:09.910 --> 05:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
Peace as a substitution um for those
 
05:02:13.948 --> 05:02:13.958 align:start position:0%
those who choose um to not enter into
 
05:02:17.110 --> 05:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
the traditional ritual of Covenant um it
 
05:02:22.190 --> 05:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
is an option it is not very um it's not
 
05:02:24.628 --> 05:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
standard it's not very it's not opted
 
05:02:27.430 --> 05:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
for very frequently one of the reasons
 
05:02:29.070 --> 05:02:29.080 align:start position:0%
that the percentage is going down in
 
05:02:30.670 --> 05:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
Israel is that the population is
 
05:02:32.910 --> 05:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
becoming more mixed um there are a lot
 
05:02:34.670 --> 05:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
of foreign workers who come into the
 
05:02:37.310 --> 05:02:37.320 align:start position:0%
country and remain there um it's not
 
05:02:39.110 --> 05:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily A Drop in the Jewish
 
05:02:41.750 --> 05:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
community um in fact most studies show
 
05:02:44.510 --> 05:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
that across the world Jews and Muslims
 
05:02:47.030 --> 05:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
still uh circumcise virtually
 
05:02:49.788 --> 05:02:49.798 align:start position:0%
universally not completely not we've
 
05:02:52.948 --> 05:02:52.958 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from um someone who's
 
05:02:55.270 --> 05:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
Jewish who opted not to circumcise her
 
05:03:00.310 --> 05:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
son um but virtually
 
05:03:02.390 --> 05:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
Universal other
 
05:03:04.670 --> 05:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative damus and then
 
05:03:04.680 --> 05:03:06.948 align:start position:0%
questions representative damus and then
representative

05:03:06.948 --> 05:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:03:09.590 --> 05:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:03:13.110 --> 05:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so just I guess
 
05:03:17.510 --> 05:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
for myself um do you believe that the
 
05:03:20.110 --> 05:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
being subsidized by the government is
 
05:03:23.990 --> 05:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
something that that is fair for those
 
05:03:27.110 --> 05:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
who want to have their boy I I
 
05:03:28.750 --> 05:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying about the
 
05:03:32.070 --> 05:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
about the Covenant um but I don't
 
05:03:35.430 --> 05:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
know how to marry those two
 
05:03:38.470 --> 05:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
things I would look at it more as the p
 
05:03:41.910 --> 05:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
as the we don't ask anybody what the
 
05:03:43.510 --> 05:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
reason is behind their choice for
 
05:03:46.310 --> 05:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
circumcision whether it's ritual whether
 
05:03:49.830 --> 05:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's um religious cultural medical we
 
05:03:52.670 --> 05:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
don't ask when parents simply make that
 
05:03:55.948 --> 05:03:55.958 align:start position:0%
option and by um doing away with
 
05:03:59.990 --> 05:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid fa funds um it is putting a I
 
05:04:03.868 --> 05:04:03.878 align:start position:0%
believe a burden on those poor Jews poor
 
05:04:08.110 --> 05:04:08.120 align:start position:0%
Muslims who seek to um seek to practice
 
05:04:09.868 --> 05:04:09.878 align:start position:0%
their religion and it is their therefore
 
05:04:12.628 --> 05:04:12.638 align:start position:0%
for creating an obstacle for them to the
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
practice thank you representative
 
05:04:18.030 --> 05:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
Weber actually I think your answer to
 
05:04:19.788 --> 05:04:19.798 align:start position:0%
that question took care of mine as well

um I was already pretty knowledgeable in
 
05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
this subject but after listening to more
 
05:05:13.548 --> 05:05:13.558 align:start position:0%
than four hours of testimony um in the
 
05:05:16.430 --> 05:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
amount of hours that I spent on Research
 
05:05:20.110 --> 05:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
frankly I was um I was pretty horrified
 
05:05:22.150 --> 05:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
with what's been going on in our
 
05:05:25.390 --> 05:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
country um and especially over the last
 
05:05:27.708 --> 05:05:27.718 align:start position:0%
decade I'm going to send you guys all an
 
05:05:30.628 --> 05:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
article and this article came out in
 
05:05:34.430 --> 05:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
2021 from an incredible man that was
 
05:05:36.750 --> 05:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
researching he was having a
 
05:05:41.510 --> 05:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
son and he wanted to to make sure that
 
05:05:44.110 --> 05:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
he looked at all the different options
 
05:05:46.030 --> 05:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
and um and I'm just going to read
 
05:05:47.670 --> 05:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
because I know you've had a long a lot
 
05:05:51.070 --> 05:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
of testimony so and it has to do with
 
05:05:53.070 --> 05:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
the selling of the
 
05:05:55.750 --> 05:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
forkins which is truly a practice that's
 
05:05:58.310 --> 05:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
happening throughout the country in with
 
05:06:00.788 --> 05:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
these hospitals and they're making money
 
05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
on it and that's the reason why there is
 
05:06:04.390 --> 05:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
no there's a push there's no informed
 
05:06:07.190 --> 05:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
consent um because once that stops for
 
05:06:09.110 --> 05:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
an elective procedure I don't even
 
05:06:11.150 --> 05:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
understand why that we would be paying
 
05:06:13.548 --> 05:06:13.558 align:start position:0%
for an elective procedure but in any
 
05:06:16.548 --> 05:06:16.558 align:start position:0%
case once it stops then this for-profit
 
05:06:18.708 --> 05:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
entity stops as
 
05:06:22.548 --> 05:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
well so this
 
05:06:26.548 --> 05:06:26.558 align:start position:0%
is a name of the company is called organ
 
05:06:26.558 --> 05:06:28.030 align:start position:0%
is a name of the company is called organ
um

05:06:28.030 --> 05:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:30.430 --> 05:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
organogenesis so why the secrecy what
 
05:06:32.788 --> 05:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
about ethics I question the ethics of
 
05:06:36.788 --> 05:06:36.798 align:start position:0%
taking the anatomically important for
 
05:06:38.390 --> 05:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
skim from a healthy baby without his
 
05:06:40.070 --> 05:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
consent in an extremely painful
 
05:06:42.590 --> 05:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
procedure for Pro for profit making
 
05:06:44.788 --> 05:06:44.798 align:start position:0%
purpose and without adequately informing
 
05:06:47.070 --> 05:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
the parents many of these parents are
 
05:06:49.070 --> 05:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
using Medicaid insurance and come from
 
05:06:51.708 --> 05:06:51.718 align:start position:0%
low-income disadvantaged communities
 
05:06:53.390 --> 05:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
these hospitals have a financial
 
05:06:56.030 --> 05:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
incentive to perform circumcisions and
 
05:06:58.310 --> 05:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
then another Financial incentive to sell
 
05:07:01.788 --> 05:07:01.798 align:start position:0%
the forkins to a for-profit company the
 
05:07:04.190 --> 05:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
hospitals are then in the role of
 
05:07:06.910 --> 05:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
providing care to infants and dispensing
 
05:07:09.750 --> 05:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
medical advice to parents this is deep
 
05:07:12.628 --> 05:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
troubling conflict of interest to me
 
05:07:14.708 --> 05:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
while some might argue that obtaining
 
05:07:16.230 --> 05:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
four skins is no different than
 
05:07:20.270 --> 05:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
collecting cord blood they are um
 
05:07:22.590 --> 05:07:22.600 align:start position:0%
mistaken the removal of the foreskin is
 
05:07:25.150 --> 05:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
a painful is a painful and involved
 
05:07:27.030 --> 05:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
procedure with a host of potential side
 
05:07:29.030 --> 05:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
effects even more importantly the
 
05:07:30.948 --> 05:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
foreskin serves as an important function
 
05:07:34.390 --> 05:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
in male sexuality in comparison the
 
05:07:36.788 --> 05:07:36.798 align:start position:0%
umbilical cord must be removed and
 
05:07:39.548 --> 05:07:39.558 align:start position:0%
discarded as it serves no further Purp
 
05:07:42.390 --> 05:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
purpose the hospitals that participate
 
05:07:44.350 --> 05:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
in the Oregon ogenesis program are
 
05:07:47.110 --> 05:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
conducting thousands of infant
 
05:07:48.990 --> 05:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
circumcisions are these doctors
 
05:07:50.948 --> 05:07:50.958 align:start position:0%
encouraging The Cutting of baby boys or
 
05:07:53.310 --> 05:07:53.320 align:start position:0%
manipulating parents from disadvantaged
 
05:07:55.270 --> 05:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
communities where otherwise they may
 
05:07:57.990 --> 05:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
have elected not to circumcise their
 
05:08:01.628 --> 05:08:01.638 align:start position:0%
son while the written guidelines suggest
 
05:08:03.708 --> 05:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
the hospital is supposed to avoid
 
05:08:06.270 --> 05:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
ethical lapses how truthfully are these
 
05:08:08.628 --> 05:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
policies being followed what training
 
05:08:10.910 --> 05:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
programs are in place to instruct staff
 
05:08:13.990 --> 05:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
in requesting parental coop cooperation
 
05:08:16.910 --> 05:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
and do verbal staff parent explanations
 
05:08:19.868 --> 05:08:19.878 align:start position:0%
match the written consent forms I know
 
05:08:23.070 --> 05:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
for a fact that they do not at Dartmouth
 
05:08:25.270 --> 05:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock especially when money is
 
05:08:28.470 --> 05:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
involved Oregon ogenesis is one company
 
05:08:30.948 --> 05:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
of many that may have commercialized
 
05:08:34.030 --> 05:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
infant foreskin how many more donation
 
05:08:36.230 --> 05:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
programs by other companies are there
 
05:08:38.548 --> 05:08:38.558 align:start position:0%
out there hidden by confidentiality
 
05:08:38.558 --> 05:08:39.948 align:start position:0%
out there hidden by confidentiality
agreements

05:08:39.948 --> 05:08:39.958 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
05:08:41.868 --> 05:08:41.878 align:start position:0%
lastly if all this activity is above
 
05:08:44.110 --> 05:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
board and conducted under the highest
 
05:08:47.310 --> 05:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
ethical standards as they claim why the
 
05:08:49.390 --> 05:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
secrecy like most children's my
 
05:08:51.510 --> 05:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
instincts are to protect my children we
 
05:08:53.670 --> 05:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
should never allow the chance that a
 
05:08:56.750 --> 05:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
child may be exploited biotech companies
 
05:08:58.708 --> 05:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
should not have the right to obtain a
 
05:09:01.590 --> 05:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
pound of our children's flesh literally
 
05:09:03.350 --> 05:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
without our knowledge or
 
05:09:06.548 --> 05:09:06.558 align:start position:0%
consent thank you thank you any
 
05:09:09.708 --> 05:09:09.718 align:start position:0%
questions our representative Woods thank
 
05:09:11.470 --> 05:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
05:09:15.788 --> 05:09:15.798 align:start position:0%
question I'm very troubled by what you
 
05:09:19.830 --> 05:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
said that in fact this tissue uh is
 
05:09:22.910 --> 05:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
being sold with and I guess the
 
05:09:25.110 --> 05:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
implication and correct me if I had the
 
05:09:27.830 --> 05:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
wrong implication that the the the
 
05:09:29.910 --> 05:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
parents do not know that this tissue is
 
05:09:32.110 --> 05:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
being sold correct the parents do not
 
05:09:34.830 --> 05:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
know this article has uh pieces of
 
05:09:37.868 --> 05:09:37.878 align:start position:0%
contract in it it it's it's fantastic it
 
05:09:40.190 --> 05:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
covers everything it goes from the time
 
05:09:42.030 --> 05:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
that where he considered it all the way
 
05:09:44.990 --> 05:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
through uh he is a CEO of a company it's
 
05:09:48.150 --> 05:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
probably one of the best um um articles
 
05:09:50.590 --> 05:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
I've ever seen and you know so a lot of
 
05:09:52.150 --> 05:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
reps are new here on the committee some
 
05:09:54.310 --> 05:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
that weren't of course the chair and um
 
05:09:55.830 --> 05:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
representative mour they're familiar
 
05:09:58.150 --> 05:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
with the testimony from last year um
 
05:10:00.470 --> 05:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's clear that uh they're not telling
 
05:10:03.390 --> 05:10:03.400 align:start position:0%
our current um hospitals here in New
 
05:10:05.470 --> 05:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are not telling anyone and so
 
05:10:07.230 --> 05:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
just so you know there's a lot of the
 
05:10:08.788 --> 05:10:08.798 align:start position:0%
the tissues that are being sent here
 
05:10:10.628 --> 05:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire they go direct to
 
05:10:12.470 --> 05:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
Boston I have all of that information I
 
05:10:15.510 --> 05:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
will be happy to to um to give all of
 
05:10:18.830 --> 05:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
that to the committee follow follow yeah
 
05:10:21.590 --> 05:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm very interested in this from
 
05:10:24.270 --> 05:10:24.280 align:start position:0%
the standpoint this violates every
 
05:10:28.310 --> 05:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
element of medical ethics and um are
 
05:10:30.390 --> 05:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
there cases that have reached the court
 
05:10:33.190 --> 05:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
level I can't imagine that they have not
 
05:10:37.070 --> 05:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
if in fact this is the what is occurring
 
05:10:39.030 --> 05:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh are there cases that have reached the
 
05:10:39.040 --> 05:10:40.510 align:start position:0%
uh are there cases that have reached the
court

05:10:40.510 --> 05:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
court
 
05:10:43.070 --> 05:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
not that I'm aware of um I'm not sure
 
05:10:46.390 --> 05:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
there was a a gentleman that that was
 
05:10:48.788 --> 05:10:48.798 align:start position:0%
here he was a lawyer from New York I
 
05:10:50.510 --> 05:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
think you guys right remember that last
 
05:10:52.990 --> 05:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
year there he had a he had a lot of
 
05:10:54.788 --> 05:10:54.798 align:start position:0%
cases a lot of cases that he had fought
 
05:10:59.868 --> 05:10:59.878 align:start position:0%
in one um informed consent um you know
 
05:11:03.310 --> 05:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
of course uh young men that had been um
 
05:11:05.390 --> 05:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
they're you know in a sense um
 
05:11:08.070 --> 05:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
permanently disabled from U procedures
 
05:11:10.628 --> 05:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
and stuff but not going after what we're
 
05:11:12.548 --> 05:11:12.558 align:start position:0%
talking about but maybe that's something
 
05:11:14.110 --> 05:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
that uh should happen and it should
 
05:11:17.628 --> 05:11:17.638 align:start position:0%
happen uh forth with at least giving
 
05:11:20.788 --> 05:11:20.798 align:start position:0%
people the knowledge parents especially
 
05:11:22.230 --> 05:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
um informed consent and is very
 
05:11:23.590 --> 05:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
important about what they're doing with
 
05:11:23.600 --> 05:11:25.150 align:start position:0%
important about what they're doing with
those

05:11:25.150 --> 05:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:11:28.310 --> 05:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
foreskins representative lontine uh
 
05:11:30.150 --> 05:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:11:32.510 --> 05:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh there's one thing
 
05:11:35.708 --> 05:11:35.718 align:start position:0%
that you said that um and I just want
 
05:11:39.708 --> 05:11:39.718 align:start position:0%
clarification that um suggest
 
05:11:43.230 --> 05:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
that babies born um insured by Medicaid
 
05:11:46.750 --> 05:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
are more likely to have circumcision
 
05:11:49.350 --> 05:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
than those on private insurance is that
 
05:11:52.390 --> 05:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
what you said no that's not I read I
 
05:11:55.590 --> 05:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
don't think so
 
05:12:00.990 --> 05:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
um I was reading the article so it is um
 
05:12:02.948 --> 05:12:02.958 align:start position:0%
I can go back to that you can and I'm
 
05:12:04.948 --> 05:12:04.958 align:start position:0%
going to send it to you anyway um many
 
05:12:06.350 --> 05:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
of these parents are using Medicaid
 
05:12:08.110 --> 05:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
insurance and come from lowi income
 
05:12:09.948 --> 05:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged communities
 
05:12:12.270 --> 05:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
um these hospitals have a financial
 
05:12:14.270 --> 05:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
incentive to perform
 
05:12:17.470 --> 05:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
circumcisions uh like no I don't I guess
 
05:12:19.350 --> 05:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
it was the question many of these babies
 
05:12:23.750 --> 05:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
it sort of suggested it was more
 
05:12:26.788 --> 05:12:26.798 align:start position:0%
than um the other like you're talking
 
05:12:28.990 --> 05:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
about one population in
 
05:12:30.910 --> 05:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
particular no I think that was just a
 
05:12:32.948 --> 05:12:32.958 align:start position:0%
statement in the article
 
05:12:36.390 --> 05:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
okay representative Paz off thank you Mr
 
05:12:38.990 --> 05:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
05:12:41.948 --> 05:12:41.958 align:start position:0%
uh do do we know when this practice of
 
05:12:46.590 --> 05:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh started practice of uh uh selling
 
05:12:48.190 --> 05:12:48.200 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
05:12:50.830 --> 05:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
tissue yes so this article talks about
 
05:12:52.910 --> 05:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
and it gives some dates and it goes back
 
05:12:56.310 --> 05:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
to like there's some dates of 2014 in
 
05:13:01.708 --> 05:13:01.718 align:start position:0%
2015 um there's uh um there's skincare
 
05:13:03.390 --> 05:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
companies things like that that are
 
05:13:06.830 --> 05:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
using these um they're used for a lot of
 
05:13:09.350 --> 05:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
different reasons um you know there was
 
05:13:11.910 --> 05:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
some unfortunately jokes from movie
 
05:13:15.030 --> 05:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
stars Sandra bulock on um on television
 
05:13:17.070 --> 05:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
shows Oprah joked about it calling it
 
05:13:20.030 --> 05:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
penis cream um yeah this is this has
 
05:13:21.750 --> 05:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
been widely known for at least a good 10
 
05:13:23.548 --> 05:13:23.558 align:start position:0%
years I don't know how long the practice
 
05:13:27.750 --> 05:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
has been I think it's been ramped up
 
05:13:30.628 --> 05:13:30.638 align:start position:0%
um it talks about it in this article um
 
05:13:36.150 --> 05:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:39.830 --> 05:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
$440 other questions
 
05:13:39.840 --> 05:13:41.390 align:start position:0%
$440 other questions
representative

05:13:41.390 --> 05:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:13:45.390 --> 05:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
McLean you you mentioned as well that um
 
05:13:46.868 --> 05:13:46.878 align:start position:0%
organizations here specifically
 
05:13:49.030 --> 05:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned Dartmouth Hitchcock they're
 
05:13:51.788 --> 05:13:51.798 align:start position:0%
not following or they're violating their
 
05:13:54.070 --> 05:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
own informed consent
 
05:13:56.628 --> 05:13:56.638 align:start position:0%
policy do you have examples or anything
 
05:13:59.030 --> 05:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
that could back that up because that's
 
05:13:59.040 --> 05:14:00.230 align:start position:0%
that could back that up because that's
pretty

05:14:00.230 --> 05:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
05:14:02.590 --> 05:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
explosive I don't I'm not saying that
 
05:14:04.628 --> 05:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
there's um I'm just saying that there's
 
05:14:07.230 --> 05:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
no they're not telling people that
 
05:14:09.230 --> 05:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
they're using the forkins in selling
 
05:14:10.990 --> 05:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
them that's what I'm talking about
 
05:14:13.750 --> 05:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's it's I I we wanted an informed
 
05:14:16.270 --> 05:14:16.280 align:start position:0%
consent Bill last session that didn't
 
05:14:21.110 --> 05:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
take place um actually the the nurse who
 
05:14:23.830 --> 05:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
is also a representative that is against
 
05:14:26.190 --> 05:14:26.200 align:start position:0%
this Medicaid portion of the bill um
 
05:14:29.230 --> 05:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
came and testified last as a nurse and
 
05:14:31.110 --> 05:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
that was one of her biggest problems and
 
05:14:33.390 --> 05:14:33.400 align:start position:0%
wanted that bill to pass because she
 
05:14:36.670 --> 05:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
felt like her in her entire time working
 
05:14:38.110 --> 05:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
within the system and I think she's in
 
05:14:41.510 --> 05:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
NASA um there's absolutely no informed
 
05:14:44.670 --> 05:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
consent of talking about the the
 
05:14:46.628 --> 05:14:46.638 align:start position:0%
problems that can you know in Waiting
 
05:14:48.590 --> 05:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
the 8 days and all of those things like
 
05:14:50.708 --> 05:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
the biblical away when clotting takes
 
05:14:52.070 --> 05:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
place so you don't have to inject
 
05:14:54.510 --> 05:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
vitamin K so there's there's a lot of
 
05:14:55.948 --> 05:14:55.958 align:start position:0%
different things but there's no really
 
05:14:57.590 --> 05:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
informed consent that's why we really
 
05:14:59.990 --> 05:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to pass that other
 
05:15:02.628 --> 05:15:02.638 align:start position:0%
Bill other
 
05:15:10.750 --> 05:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:13.548 --> 05:15:13.558 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Anthony
 
05:15:16.548 --> 05:15:16.558 align:start position:0%
losquadro representing the Health Equity
 
05:15:26.910 --> 05:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:29.230 --> 05:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
campaign again sir you've asked for five
 
05:15:30.510 --> 05:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
minutes if you could keep it to three
 
05:15:39.110 --> 05:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:41.030 --> 05:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
Health Quality campaign you could put
 
05:15:44.548 --> 05:15:44.558 align:start position:0%
your microphone on sorry uh my name is
 
05:15:46.190 --> 05:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
Anthony L squadro I'm the director of
 
05:15:48.030 --> 05:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
the Health Quality campaign and I
 
05:15:50.788 --> 05:15:50.798 align:start position:0%
represent the growing CHS Across America
 
05:15:52.910 --> 05:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
that advocate for higher standards for
 
05:15:55.470 --> 05:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
the bodily autonomy of children and I
 
05:15:58.150 --> 05:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
urge your support for this bill
 
05:16:00.670 --> 05:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
specifically when it comes to medically
 
05:16:03.510 --> 05:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessary elective non-therapeutic
 
05:16:07.470 --> 05:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
infant circumcision or entic it's a
 
05:16:09.948 --> 05:16:09.958 align:start position:0%
fancy way of saying it doesn't do
 
05:16:13.070 --> 05:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
anything and you don't need it I
 
05:16:14.628 --> 05:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
prepared a package of brief but
 
05:16:17.030 --> 05:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
informative documents for each Committee
 
05:16:20.190 --> 05:16:20.200 align:start position:0%
Member on the page Marked One There's a
 
05:16:21.948 --> 05:16:21.958 align:start position:0%
summary of issues that you may find
 
05:16:23.788 --> 05:16:23.798 align:start position:0%
enlightening especially if you're
 
05:16:26.430 --> 05:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with the topic but on the
 
05:16:27.510 --> 05:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
other hand if you always thought
 
05:16:30.070 --> 05:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
circumcision was somehow beneficial or
 
05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
that men wanted this done to them you
 
05:16:34.670 --> 05:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
might be surprised and I ask you to all
 
05:16:37.470 --> 05:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
keep an open mind this section covers
 
05:16:40.470 --> 05:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
how 17 other stat have dropped coverage
 
05:16:42.430 --> 05:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
and more considering it because it
 
05:16:45.390 --> 05:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
serves no purpose it covers and this
 
05:16:47.310 --> 05:16:47.320 align:start position:0%
document also covers complication rates
 
05:16:49.750 --> 05:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
for the for the practice and it provides
 
05:16:52.788 --> 05:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
sources on psychological harm resulting
 
05:16:55.350 --> 05:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
from enti and I
 
05:16:58.548 --> 05:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
think most reasonable people understand
 
05:17:01.750 --> 05:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's wrong to cut female children's
 
05:17:04.150 --> 05:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
genitals in fact it's
 
05:17:06.350 --> 05:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
illegal so therefore it stands for
 
05:17:08.548 --> 05:17:08.558 align:start position:0%
reason we shouldn't use Public Funding
 
05:17:11.390 --> 05:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
to male children's genitals either we
 
05:17:13.670 --> 05:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
should all have equal protection under
 
05:17:16.070 --> 05:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
the law which the 14th amendment
 
05:17:18.910 --> 05:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
guarantees to all of us but now some
 
05:17:21.150 --> 05:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
people will say male circumcision is
 
05:17:24.070 --> 05:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
different it has medical benefits but
 
05:17:26.150 --> 05:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
they'll ignore the fact that no American
 
05:17:29.230 --> 05:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
Medical Association recommends anti
 
05:17:32.548 --> 05:17:32.558 align:start position:0%
circumcision and virtually all medical
 
05:17:34.830 --> 05:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
associations around the world
 
05:17:37.590 --> 05:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
specifically do not recommend it in the
 
05:17:40.708 --> 05:17:40.718 align:start position:0%
absence of a bona IED medical condition
 
05:17:42.310 --> 05:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
now I can draw your attention to the
 
05:17:44.830 --> 05:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
page marked two which is a statement
 
05:17:47.548 --> 05:17:47.558 align:start position:0%
from the Canadian Pediatric Society and
 
05:17:49.628 --> 05:17:49.638 align:start position:0%
what they say is the Canadian Pediatric
 
05:17:52.510 --> 05:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
Society does not recommend routine
 
05:17:56.270 --> 05:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:00.750 --> 05:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
male uh and Canadian Public Health Care
 
05:18:03.470 --> 05:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
does not cover infant circumcision and
 
05:18:05.430 --> 05:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
they're doing just fine there there
 
05:18:07.830 --> 05:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
aren't any Mass public health problems
 
05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
or religious
 
05:18:11.510 --> 05:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
and the vast majority of babies in
 
05:18:14.110 --> 05:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
Canada are being left intact matter of
 
05:18:16.030 --> 05:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
fact it's only some states in the US
 
05:18:18.190 --> 05:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
that covers this with Public Health Care
 
05:18:20.230 --> 05:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
virtually no other country around the
 
05:18:22.708 --> 05:18:22.718 align:start position:0%
world covers infant circumcision with
 
05:18:24.788 --> 05:18:24.798 align:start position:0%
their public health
 
05:18:28.110 --> 05:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
system on page four uh there's a study
 
05:18:30.670 --> 05:18:30.680 align:start position:0%
from the Journal of Pediatric Urology
 
05:18:32.030 --> 05:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
which found an
 
05:18:35.070 --> 05:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
11.5% complication rate based on the all
 
05:18:37.990 --> 05:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
claims insurance database complications
 
05:18:40.628 --> 05:18:40.638 align:start position:0%
can include effect bleeding scarring and
 
05:18:43.708 --> 05:18:43.718 align:start position:0%
so on I ask you to consider the cost of
 
05:18:45.830 --> 05:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
these complication Corrections which are
 
05:18:48.628 --> 05:18:48.638 align:start position:0%
called revisions into your cost analysis
 
05:18:50.708 --> 05:18:50.718 align:start position:0%
and they should be added to the fiscal
 
05:18:53.510 --> 05:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
note packet F page five of my packet
 
05:18:55.750 --> 05:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
includes cost benefit analysis from Dr
 
05:18:57.628 --> 05:18:57.638 align:start position:0%
Rober vanau who's a professor of
 
05:19:00.350 --> 05:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics Central Michigan University
 
05:19:02.470 --> 05:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
in the Journal of medical decisionmaking
 
05:19:04.510 --> 05:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
and he did an analysis if infant
 
05:19:06.350 --> 05:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
circumcision was more start wrapping up
 
05:19:09.190 --> 05:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
sir yes sir uh if infant circum C was
 
05:19:11.150 --> 05:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
more cost effective over the life of a
 
05:19:13.990 --> 05:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
patient he concluded that it was not
 
05:19:16.270 --> 05:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
what he said is neonatal circumcision is
 
05:19:18.708 --> 05:19:18.718 align:start position:0%
not good health policy and support for
 
05:19:20.590 --> 05:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
it as a medical procedure cannot be
 
05:19:23.548 --> 05:19:23.558 align:start position:0%
justified financially or medically so
 
05:19:25.830 --> 05:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
with that I'll I'll wrap up and I'll say
 
05:19:28.990 --> 05:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh I ask that you support this bill and
 
05:19:30.590 --> 05:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh children of people and they deserve
 
05:19:32.390 --> 05:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
to live their lives with natural intact
 
05:19:34.310 --> 05:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
bodies thank you very much okay thank
 
05:19:39.548 --> 05:19:39.558 align:start position:0%
you any questions for gentlemen
 
05:19:45.190 --> 05:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:48.110 --> 05:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
you no one else has signed up to testify
 
05:19:53.310 --> 05:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
on hb994 FN does anyone else wish to
 
05:19:55.470 --> 05:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
testify seeing no one I am going to

05:36:42.868 --> 05:36:42.878 align:start position:0%
bill and representative delus do you
 
05:36:43.750 --> 05:36:43.760 align:start position:0%

05:36:45.868 --> 05:36:45.878 align:start position:0%
motion okay do either of you wish to
 
05:36:47.910 --> 05:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes thank you Mr
 
05:36:51.230 --> 05:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
chair um first of all I mean I don't
 
05:36:55.230 --> 05:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
want to minimize La covid um you know I
 
05:36:57.868 --> 05:36:57.878 align:start position:0%
know some people that have had it um and
 
05:37:00.548 --> 05:37:00.558 align:start position:0%
certainly uh representative Thomas's
 
05:37:04.270 --> 05:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
testimony was compelling but um there
 
05:37:08.548 --> 05:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
are uh a whole Myriad of illnesses you
 
05:37:10.750 --> 05:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
know that we could look at and have
 
05:37:13.150 --> 05:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
commissions on and we already have 300
 
05:37:15.830 --> 05:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
commissions I think it's not so much a
 
05:37:19.430 --> 05:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
question of is the issue real as a
 
05:37:22.110 --> 05:37:22.120 align:start position:0%
question of do we have the bandwidth to
 
05:37:24.750 --> 05:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
go after it um with the resources that
 
05:37:27.350 --> 05:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
we have and so I I think um at this
 
05:37:29.470 --> 05:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
point in time I would recommend itl
 
05:37:34.110 --> 05:37:34.120 align:start position:0%
thank you any other discussion on the
 
05:37:37.910 --> 05:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
motion representative palaz off
 
05:37:42.990 --> 05:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh I just uh want to agree and add that
 
05:37:46.110 --> 05:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
um there uh used to be special committee
 
05:37:50.430 --> 05:37:50.440 align:start position:0%
on Co response efficacy and uh then
 
05:37:53.590 --> 05:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative G Merchant uh he raised
 
05:37:57.628 --> 05:37:57.638 align:start position:0%
the question of long Co so um there's a
 
05:38:01.868 --> 05:38:01.878 align:start position:0%
chance that uh committee will be um
 
05:38:05.750 --> 05:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
reconvened and uh long Co will be one of
 
05:38:08.750 --> 05:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
its topics so uh there might not be need
 
05:38:12.110 --> 05:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
for another commission for that thank
 
05:38:15.788 --> 05:38:15.798 align:start position:0%
you thank you other discussion
 
05:38:17.590 --> 05:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative mlan could you I didn't
 
05:38:19.590 --> 05:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
quite hear that what what commission was
 
05:38:22.628 --> 05:38:22.638 align:start position:0%
that represent what was a special
 
05:38:26.868 --> 05:38:26.878 align:start position:0%
committee on covid response efficacy and
 
05:38:30.070 --> 05:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
um uh it's kind of like special
 
05:38:32.070 --> 05:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
committee but also standing committee
 
05:38:36.310 --> 05:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
and um there's a push to reestablish it
 
05:38:38.750 --> 05:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
with long Co being in one of its topics
 
05:38:43.830 --> 05:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:47.230 --> 05:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
overlapping repres
 
05:38:50.350 --> 05:38:50.360 align:start position:0%
wber um thank you Mr chairman my my
 
05:38:52.708 --> 05:38:52.718 align:start position:0%
understanding that that is and I could
 
05:38:54.750 --> 05:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
be wrong about this but the I thought
 
05:38:58.510 --> 05:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
the charge on the commission on covid
 
05:39:02.310 --> 05:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
response was to discuss the quality of
 
05:39:05.110 --> 05:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
the emergency response there and the
 
05:39:08.350 --> 05:39:08.360 align:start position:0%
thrust of this committee would be
 
05:39:09.510 --> 05:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
05:39:14.230 --> 05:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
economic concerns created by long Co um
 
05:39:17.910 --> 05:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
I too don't want to minimize the effects
 
05:39:21.150 --> 05:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
of long covid either for the
 
05:39:24.110 --> 05:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
individual uh medically or financially
 
05:39:27.868 --> 05:39:27.878 align:start position:0%
or for society as a whole in the amount
 
05:39:31.830 --> 05:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
that we lose to that but there are any
 
05:39:31.840 --> 05:39:32.948 align:start position:0%
that we lose to that but there are any
number

05:39:32.948 --> 05:39:32.958 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:39:38.430 --> 05:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
of uh chronic diseases that have
 
05:39:42.868 --> 05:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
some or similar aspects to them and then
 
05:39:44.510 --> 05:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
the other thing was we were actually
 
05:39:47.030 --> 05:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
handed a fairly comprehensive study by
 
05:39:49.708 --> 05:39:49.718 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire uh fiscal policy
 
05:39:54.270 --> 05:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
Institute I believe uh so I think that a
 
05:39:57.788 --> 05:39:57.798 align:start position:0%
lot of the ground has been already
 
05:40:01.990 --> 05:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
plowed um so um without wanting to
 
05:40:04.310 --> 05:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
minimize the concerns I think I'm going
 
05:40:05.590 --> 05:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
05:40:07.868 --> 05:40:07.878 align:start position:0%
against okay thank you
 
05:40:10.628 --> 05:40:10.638 align:start position:0%
representative Woods um from my
 
05:40:12.750 --> 05:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
perspective just from the basic science
 
05:40:15.708 --> 05:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
uh uh perspective I think this is
 
05:40:17.670 --> 05:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
premature uh the New England Journal of
 
05:40:20.070 --> 05:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
Medicine just a month ago uh had a very
 
05:40:23.670 --> 05:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
nice review article uh trying to Define
 
05:40:28.230 --> 05:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
what is long co uh so I think uh this is
 
05:40:31.150 --> 05:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is basically a step ahead we
 
05:40:33.390 --> 05:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
don't even know the medical community
 
05:40:36.190 --> 05:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
can't really decide precisely what it is
 
05:40:39.590 --> 05:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
let alone uh legislate how you're going
 
05:40:42.548 --> 05:40:42.558 align:start position:0%
to interact but I think we need to stand
 
05:40:46.628 --> 05:40:46.638 align:start position:0%
back and wait a bit okay thank you other
 
05:40:49.510 --> 05:40:49.520 align:start position:0%

what rep wood said um just for just to
 
05:40:57.910 --> 05:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
disclosure I'm a co-sponsor on this
 
05:41:00.190 --> 05:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
legislation so I will be voting in favor
 
05:41:02.548 --> 05:41:02.558 align:start position:0%
of it for that reason but I totally
 
05:41:04.310 --> 05:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
agree with you that we really need to
 
05:41:05.830 --> 05:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
actually get it into the correct
 
05:41:07.868 --> 05:41:07.878 align:start position:0%
category it belongs in and kind of have
 
05:41:09.708 --> 05:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
a better definition for that and get
 
05:41:12.830 --> 05:41:12.840 align:start position:0%

you have a motion yes uh thank you Mr
 
05:43:23.430 --> 05:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
chair I would like to make a motion of
 
05:43:26.110 --> 05:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on HP
 
05:43:28.750 --> 05:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
370 uh representative McGrath do you
 
05:43:30.548 --> 05:43:30.558 align:start position:0%
have a
 
05:43:32.590 --> 05:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
motion you have a
 
05:43:37.670 --> 05:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
second okay uh discussion
 
05:43:39.270 --> 05:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
I'll be very brief Mr chair just
 
05:43:41.868 --> 05:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
basically kind of repeating some of the
 
05:43:43.548 --> 05:43:43.558 align:start position:0%
testimony I think there's a real need
 
05:43:45.628 --> 05:43:45.638 align:start position:0%
here um even though we're only talking
 
05:43:49.830 --> 05:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
about 10 people um the
 
05:43:54.910 --> 05:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
uh the the the this is a very limited in
 
05:43:56.990 --> 05:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
scope I think this is something that is
 
05:44:00.390 --> 05:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
solvable uh the commission was already
 
05:44:02.670 --> 05:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
formed and this is a reforming of the
 
05:44:04.468 --> 05:44:04.478 align:start position:0%
commission the only reason they were not
 
05:44:06.510 --> 05:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
able to do their work is because they
 
05:44:09.468 --> 05:44:09.478 align:start position:0%
were formed really at the very end the
 
05:44:11.390 --> 05:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
members of that commission are highly
 
05:44:13.788 --> 05:44:13.798 align:start position:0%
motivated to go forward um so this will
 
05:44:15.510 --> 05:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
not be a commission in name only this
 
05:44:17.590 --> 05:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
will be a commission in fact that will
 
05:44:20.390 --> 05:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
actually be able to bring forth I hope a
 
05:44:23.190 --> 05:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
good solution thank you Mr chair thank
 
05:44:25.670 --> 05:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
you any other discussion representative
 
05:44:28.150 --> 05:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
McGrath did you have any comments
 
05:44:32.110 --> 05:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
or thank you representative Weber I just
 
05:44:34.830 --> 05:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to be sure that we had clearly in
 
05:44:37.990 --> 05:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
front of us the fact that uh some people
 
05:44:41.070 --> 05:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
who are caught in the interstices
 
05:44:41.080 --> 05:44:42.830 align:start position:0%
who are caught in the interstices
between

05:44:42.830 --> 05:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
between
 
05:44:47.110 --> 05:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh behavioral crisis and uh intellectual
 
05:44:49.628 --> 05:44:49.638 align:start position:0%
disability simply can't receive services
 
05:44:51.788 --> 05:44:51.798 align:start position:0%
and we absolutely have to fix this so
 
05:44:53.310 --> 05:44:53.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing it Forward is
 
05:44:55.110 --> 05:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
05:44:59.270 --> 05:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
pass representative Nagel um I wanted to
 
05:45:02.030 --> 05:45:02.040 align:start position:0%

05:45:03.868 --> 05:45:03.878 align:start position:0%
Health assessment meeting yesterday a
 
05:45:07.590 --> 05:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
consumer begged us to solve this problem
 
05:45:10.270 --> 05:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
and cited a number of examples of why
 
05:45:12.708 --> 05:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
this is a problem and this group has
 
05:45:13.990 --> 05:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
passion and I think we should let them
 
05:45:14.948 --> 05:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
do their
 
05:45:19.430 --> 05:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
job thank you other

I highly respect um veterans and their
 
05:47:14.628 --> 05:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
needs and PTSD and all of that but from
 
05:47:17.390 --> 05:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
what we heard uh during the
 
05:47:19.750 --> 05:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
hearings um even one of our main
 
05:47:21.390 --> 05:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
sponsors of all these bills
 
05:47:23.230 --> 05:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas she said she
 
05:47:27.270 --> 05:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
tepidly supports this bill um I wrote
 
05:47:28.830 --> 05:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
those words because I thought that was
 
05:47:30.910 --> 05:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
interesting um and several others
 
05:47:33.430 --> 05:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
including the honorable Jerry kerk said
 
05:47:36.350 --> 05:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
that he didn't support it um and others
 
05:47:39.270 --> 05:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
so and also seemed like it was kind of
 
05:47:43.030 --> 05:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
there's a cost shifting aspect to it and
 
05:47:46.868 --> 05:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
uh so for that reason I I vote itl I
 
05:47:50.510 --> 05:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
move itl okay other discussion
 
05:47:52.750 --> 05:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
representative Palazo yeah second this
 
05:47:56.270 --> 05:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
motion because uh uh of cost shifting
 
05:48:01.390 --> 05:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
aspect I am ready to work uh um with the
 
05:48:04.150 --> 05:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
veterans organization how we can uh
 
05:48:07.990 --> 05:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
improve their access to uh needed um
 
05:48:10.150 --> 05:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
chemical for chemicals for medical
 
05:48:14.548 --> 05:48:14.558 align:start position:0%
reasons but uh this uh bill doesn't do
 
05:48:17.430 --> 05:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
much only $50 for three years but also
 
05:48:21.270 --> 05:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
it uh shifts cost on some other parts of
 
05:48:24.070 --> 05:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
the system so I don't think it's needed
 
05:48:27.750 --> 05:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any other discussion
 
05:48:30.230 --> 05:48:30.240 align:start position:0%

oppose the it I I'm on the therapeutic
 
05:48:38.230 --> 05:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis Medical oversight board I was
 
05:48:41.230 --> 05:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
part of that discussion on this bill um
 
05:48:44.150 --> 05:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
this provoked a lot of thought three
 
05:48:47.750 --> 05:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
votes and not a single vote passed um so
 
05:48:50.230 --> 05:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
we were just left to say what we wanted
 
05:48:52.390 --> 05:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
um and I think representative kerk did
 
05:48:57.070 --> 05:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
relay that to us um um my initial
 
05:48:58.830 --> 05:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
thought was actually that I opposed this
 
05:49:00.390 --> 05:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
and then the more we talked the more I
 
05:49:02.468 --> 05:49:02.478 align:start position:0%
liked it one of the reasons why was
 
05:49:05.030 --> 05:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
number one the veterans do not have any
 
05:49:07.390 --> 05:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
access to therapeutic cannabis through
 
05:49:10.150 --> 05:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
the VA system they are actually punished
 
05:49:11.990 --> 05:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
by the VA system for going through it if
 
05:49:13.590 --> 05:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
they want to get it they have to go
 
05:49:15.830 --> 05:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
outside of the system I do know a lot of
 
05:49:17.350 --> 05:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
veterans that do it but I think the
 
05:49:20.030 --> 05:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
testimony that bothered me the most was
 
05:49:21.548 --> 05:49:21.558 align:start position:0%
the most common reason that combat
 
05:49:23.910 --> 05:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
veterans use medical cannabis is not for
 
05:49:26.708 --> 05:49:26.718 align:start position:0%
PTSD but for pain and the fact that the
 
05:49:28.590 --> 05:49:28.600 align:start position:0%
gentleman that was representing veterans
 
05:49:30.708 --> 05:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
seemed unaware of that really bothered
 
05:49:32.868 --> 05:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
me a lot and and maybe that's a really
 
05:49:35.788 --> 05:49:35.798 align:start position:0%
rotten reason to oppose this but um I've
 
05:49:38.150 --> 05:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
seen that in a lot of settings elsewhere
 
05:49:39.830 --> 05:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
and it really bothers me that people
 
05:49:44.150 --> 05:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
don't recognize that um um with that
 
05:49:46.270 --> 05:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
said a lot of the groups that we felt
 
05:49:48.030 --> 05:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
that were somewhat like veterans did
 
05:49:49.868 --> 05:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
have access were the veterans don't and
 
05:49:51.750 --> 05:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
I realize this is a trivial thing but I
 
05:49:53.310 --> 05:49:53.320 align:start position:0%
think the cough shifting actually is
 
05:49:56.190 --> 05:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
fairly trivial as well so that's why I
 
05:49:56.200 --> 05:49:57.310 align:start position:0%
fairly trivial as well so that's why I
oppose

05:49:57.310 --> 05:49:57.320 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
05:50:00.548 --> 05:50:00.558 align:start position:0%

05:51:55.468 --> 05:51:55.478 align:start position:0%
seconds representative Nagel do you wish
 
05:51:59.070 --> 05:51:59.080 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion um I hear over
 
05:52:00.830 --> 05:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
and over again how we have too many
 
05:52:03.590 --> 05:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
commissions however I feel very strongly
 
05:52:05.708 --> 05:52:05.718 align:start position:0%
about commissions that are passionate
 
05:52:07.708 --> 05:52:07.718 align:start position:0%
about what they do about important
 
05:52:10.430 --> 05:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
subjects this is an important subject
 
05:52:14.110 --> 05:52:14.120 align:start position:0%
about increasing access to care um 30%
 
05:52:15.990 --> 05:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
of my patients live in the North country
 
05:52:18.190 --> 05:52:18.200 align:start position:0%
and I can't live without tele tella
 
05:52:20.948 --> 05:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
Health it's really important um I think
 
05:52:23.350 --> 05:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
that's one of the shin Silver Linings of
 
05:52:25.750 --> 05:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
covid is the increased access what
 
05:52:28.390 --> 05:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
became somewhat concerning that I showed
 
05:52:30.468 --> 05:52:30.478 align:start position:0%
people earlier today was this came from
 
05:52:32.868 --> 05:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
CMS and which they apparently are going
 
05:52:35.350 --> 05:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
back to pre-co tah Health rules which I
 
05:52:36.948 --> 05:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
think is
 
05:52:38.708 --> 05:52:38.718 align:start position:0%
hopefully not as tragic as it would
 
05:52:41.468 --> 05:52:41.478 align:start position:0%
appear superficially but because of that
 
05:52:43.110 --> 05:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
this is an ongoing issue that we really
 
05:52:45.910 --> 05:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
need to stay on top of and study um
 
05:52:47.830 --> 05:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
especially yeah we have no control over
 
05:52:50.030 --> 05:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
CMS per se but we do have control over
 
05:52:51.628 --> 05:52:51.638 align:start position:0%
what goes on in this state and I think
 
05:52:53.868 --> 05:52:53.878 align:start position:0%
we need to stay on top of
 
05:52:58.190 --> 05:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative Woods uh I
 
05:53:01.150 --> 05:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
would wholeheartedly agree um tele
 
05:53:05.270 --> 05:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
medicine is one of the sort of shiny
 
05:53:07.948 --> 05:53:07.958 align:start position:0%
examples of what we can can do with our
 
05:53:10.548 --> 05:53:10.558 align:start position:0%
technology uh some things have not been
 
05:53:12.910 --> 05:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
so illustrious with what we've done with
 
05:53:15.788 --> 05:53:15.798 align:start position:0%
our technology this I think is really
 
05:53:17.948 --> 05:53:17.958 align:start position:0%
represents one of the real shining
 
05:53:20.708 --> 05:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
examples of what we can do to help
 
05:53:23.628 --> 05:53:23.638 align:start position:0%
patients in every Dimension I mean this
 
05:53:28.628 --> 05:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
is there is an article this week um that
 
05:53:31.910 --> 05:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
highlighted the business about trying to
 
05:53:34.030 --> 05:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
have patients not come to the hospital
 
05:53:37.350 --> 05:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
certain things you can handle at home
 
05:53:40.708 --> 05:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
by with tele Advanced forms of tele
 
05:53:43.788 --> 05:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
medicine the ramifications of this are
 
05:53:47.628 --> 05:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
just tremendous all to the good
 
05:53:50.390 --> 05:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
basically at this point so I'm really
 
05:53:53.030 --> 05:53:53.040 align:start position:0%

05:55:28.190 --> 05:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
amendment uh representative Weber do you
 
05:55:29.750 --> 05:55:29.760 align:start position:0%

05:55:32.190 --> 05:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
discussion I would be glad I would be

glad to is there anybody who had did not
 
05:55:35.868 --> 05:55:35.878 align:start position:0%
get a copy of the amendment because I
 
05:55:37.430 --> 05:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
have many
 
05:55:41.230 --> 05:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
extras uh I would like Mr chairman to
 
05:55:45.510 --> 05:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:47.750 --> 05:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
0132 and if there's a second I would
 
05:55:49.910 --> 05:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
like to speak to it I will second
 
05:55:52.190 --> 05:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
representative Paz off seconds
 
05:55:55.750 --> 05:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative Weber uh so what this
 
05:56:01.190 --> 05:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
does is when the bill came to us it was
 
05:56:03.708 --> 05:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
somewhat unclear and we were hearing a
 
05:56:06.430 --> 05:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
certain amount of concern
 
05:56:09.948 --> 05:56:09.958 align:start position:0%
about what the offsite premises might
 
05:56:11.948 --> 05:56:11.958 align:start position:0%
look like and there was also some
 
05:56:16.708 --> 05:56:16.718 align:start position:0%
concern about how many off premises uh
 
05:56:19.788 --> 05:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
sites this might extend to and whether
 
05:56:21.670 --> 05:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
they could be used by people from other
 
05:56:24.750 --> 05:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
states and various other things and so
 
05:56:27.510 --> 05:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
this comes to us from Mr
 
05:56:31.070 --> 05:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
Simon uh and it specifically says that
 
05:56:35.030 --> 05:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
each of the atc's may have one offsite
 
05:56:38.350 --> 05:56:38.360 align:start position:0%
premise and and that premise is going to
 
05:56:42.310 --> 05:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
be a greenhouse so instead of discussing
 
05:56:44.670 --> 05:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
what might happen this is very clear
 
05:56:47.510 --> 05:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
about what's going to happen and I think
 
05:56:50.510 --> 05:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
with that that may have uh resolved some
 
05:56:53.628 --> 05:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
of the concerns that various people had

not only here but among law enforcement

adopt the amendment and then go on to

05:59:36.110 --> 05:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 301 a HB 301 with the as
 
05:59:41.070 --> 05:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
amended 03132 H any other discussion uh
 
05:59:44.708 --> 05:59:44.718 align:start position:0%
if I may uh to speak uh it's a common
 
05:59:48.070 --> 05:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
sense approach uh that tried in the
 
05:59:50.868 --> 05:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
states around us and uh amendment that
 
05:59:54.468 --> 05:59:54.478 align:start position:0%
by representative web makes it it more
 
05:59:59.390 --> 05:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
tigh and strict uh so there would be no
 
06:00:03.708 --> 06:00:03.718 align:start position:0%
complain or uh issue issues with zoning
 
06:00:08.110 --> 06:00:08.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh at the same time uh this approach
 
06:00:13.190 --> 06:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
would allow to uh save uh uh significant
 
06:00:15.868 --> 06:00:15.878 align:start position:0%
amount of resources because uh
 
06:00:19.230 --> 06:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
artificial uh lightning uh uh consumes a
 
06:00:22.708 --> 06:00:22.718 align:start position:0%
lot of energy and allowing using uh
 
06:00:26.310 --> 06:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
sunlight uh is a right approach so
 
06:00:30.750 --> 06:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
please support it okay other
 
06:00:33.390 --> 06:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
