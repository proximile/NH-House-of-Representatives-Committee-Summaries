dollars
 
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
to provide some background and i know
 
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
that there
 
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
are speakers after me as well very
 
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
experienced in this
 
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
and have been following it very closely
 
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
public charter schools were granted the
 
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.390 align:start position:0%
public charter schools were granted the
ability

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
ability
 
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
to receive lease aid in 2012
 
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
but that program was not funded
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
this may be in part that only the 30
 
00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
formula in that rsa was mentioned
 
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
but there was never a specific monetary
 
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
cap that cap came
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
in the last budget biennium 2019-20
 
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
and the governor specifically included
 
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
that the annual lease
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
aid be included not to exceed thirty
 
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
per school in his budget
 
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
now as of 2019 that monetary cap is in
 
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.909 align:start position:0%
now as of 2019 that monetary cap is in
place

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
because local districts and the state
 
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
do not give assistance to purchase
 
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
facility space
 
00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
an increase in the maximum lease aid
 
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
cap is a reasonable approach
 
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
to assist the far vast majority
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
of students enrolled in public charter
 
00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.150 align:start position:0%
of students enrolled in public charter
schools

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
with that i will complete my testimony

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
a summary of the lease aid from 2021
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
on another screen here to my left it's
 
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
one of the beauties of testifying online
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
and of that list i see none that have
 
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
have exceeded the 30 000. but of course
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
that was the cap
 
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%

thank you uh chairman weiler
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
so at this point we don't really have
 
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
data about how many
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
would apply for funding beyond
 
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
the 30 thousand i don't

that information
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh at my fingertips but uh
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
i certainly know that charter schools
 
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
are in support of this measure so i
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
would imagine that
 
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:49.940 align:start position:0%
several would be interested in that
 
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.430 align:start position:0%
several would be interested in that

do you how much um additional funding do
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
you anticipate
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
this would cost the uh in the state
 
00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:11.270 align:start position:0%
this would cost the uh in the state
budget

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
i see there's no appropriation on this
 
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.629 align:start position:0%
i see there's no appropriation on this
bill

00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
i don't uh foresee
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
any additional because it would simply
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
be within whatever
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
monetary number was allotted for that
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%

representative muni for taking my
question

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
my question to you is specifically with
 
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
regard to
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
the municipal association and the
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
feedback that you may or may not have
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
received from them
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
it would appear in my own city of
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
manchester we have a number of schools
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
that probably will
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
be vacant um based on some of the
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations that that we've heard
 
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
from our
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
planners um there still will be huge
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
huge costs uh to municipalities
 
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
um there's still the insurance costs and
 
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
there are um
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
maintenance and at any number of things
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
local municipality would still
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
incur as well as
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
a possible tax impact in terms of the
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
please

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
you representative as i understand it
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
uh it sounds like you're asking whether
 
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
or not the munici
 
00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
i have heard from the municipal
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
association on this bill and the answer
 
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
is no
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you okay i'm looking to see if
 
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else has questions
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative mooney until we
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
know what we have in the funds our
 
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.430 align:start position:0%
know what we have in the funds our
general

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
process when bills come to us during the
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
budget process and to retain the bill
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
then when we go through the um education
 
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.470 align:start position:0%
then when we go through the um education
budget

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
we do our best to include that money
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
since you know it's an active bill
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
before us so if there's any way we can
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
we will try to fund that we'll probably
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
get some further
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
as to how many uh will be affected and
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
what what the costs are likely to be
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to have the lba look that
 
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:30.550 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to have the lba look that
up

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
and so we'll have we'll have more data
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
when we uh get to the budget and put
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
money in for the charter schools for
 
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.870 align:start position:0%
money in for the charter schools for
that

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
so don't be shocked if we retain the
 
00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:40.389 align:start position:0%
so don't be shocked if we retain the
bill

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%

two different boards

tremendous to charter schools
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
when you look at thirty thousand dollars

substantial difference

00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
um as representative mooney described
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
there's approximately 4 300
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
full-time students in brick and mortar
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%

serving 29 public charter schools across
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
i just want to go over a couple points
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
unlike traditional public charter school
 
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:27.669 align:start position:0%
unlike traditional public charter school
or

00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
unlike traditional public schools new
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire charter schools do not receive
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
local or state financial assistance to
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
build or purchase
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
facility space of their own so as a
 
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.870 align:start position:0%
facility space of their own so as a
result

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
result
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
as she said the the vast majority of our
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
schools lease their instructional space
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
this amounts to a total cost to lease
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
facility space
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
i reached out to our schools and mickey
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
is correct there are 11
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
schools that met the 30 cap last year
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
so you would have approximately 11
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
schools applying if you increase the
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
funding to 50 000 per year
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
um and i think that is my last update
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
for you but we are in strong support of
 
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.549 align:start position:0%
for you but we are in strong support of
this

00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
this point i can recognize them in order
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mickey and it was mr vest
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%

00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:30.230 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be here my name is bob
best

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
best
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
and a strong supporter of charter
 
00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.590 align:start position:0%
and a strong supporter of charter
schools

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
both with my time and with my money and
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
support this legislation
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
i am the board chair at founders academy
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
i'm the treasurer at spark academy um
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm an
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
attorney in concord that provide legal
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
services to
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
one existing charter school and three
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
that are on the way to being developed
 
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.430 align:start position:0%
that are on the way to being developed
so

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
i really do spend a lot of my time
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
thinking about this and i support it
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
because of school choice
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's a fabulous model to
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
have schools that are designed to
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
perform and if you don't perform people
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
will choose something else
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that that can do nothing but
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
great things for students
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
i support this legislation because when
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
you start a charter school
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
your building is your single biggest
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
expense and it's the hardest thing to
 
00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:17.830 align:start position:0%
expense and it's the hardest thing to
find

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
um it's very difficult to negotiate with
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
landlords because they want to make sure
 
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
that you've got the ability to pay your
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
rent um and certainly if you're
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
acquiring a building there's that
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
challenge too
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
and this certainly goes a long way
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
towards helping and when you think about
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
how much it helps
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
the 20 000 increase that this bill
 
00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:37.029 align:start position:0%
the 20 000 increase that this bill
proposes

00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
proposes
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
is almost half the salary of a teacher
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
at a charter school and so it adds that
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
much more to the classroom that you can
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
give back
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
for twenty thousand dollars um you know
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
our school would probably be able to
 
00:21:50.799 --> 00:21:51.669 align:start position:0%
our school would probably be able to
acquire

00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
acquire
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
like a hundred chromebooks for students
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to use
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
um you're really talking about that's
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
the way that this translates when you
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
get a little bit of help with your
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
lease aid it frees up your money to do
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
other great things that are so important
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
to the charter school
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
and to the to the impact on the students
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
and it's all about their choice and we
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
have to do a good job
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
and that's why i support the legislation
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to say
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr best thank you for all your
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
work you do first charters
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
i don't see any hands raised
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming mickey who do we
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
have next that we can
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
contact uh the next name that i have
 
00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:35.510 align:start position:0%
contact uh the next name that i have
here

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%

00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
her
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%

raise and
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
i think would like to speak so i'm going
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
okay amy clark welcome to finance
 
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
community um
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
hello uh good morning for the record my
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
name is amy clark
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
and i am the administrator for the
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
school building aid program at the
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh building aid encompasses lease aid
 
00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:12.710 align:start position:0%
uh building aid encompasses lease aid
under

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
rsa 198 15 hh
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
i believe and i just wanted to just um
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
i actually didn't sign up to speak i'm
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
here for technical support if you have
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
but i do just want to clarify something
 
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.110 align:start position:0%
but i do just want to clarify something
um

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't make any increased
 
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.870 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't make any increased
appropriation

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
police aid therefore trapping it at 50
 
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:35.750 align:start position:0%
police aid therefore trapping it at 50
000

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
just changes the way that we would
 
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.190 align:start position:0%
just changes the way that we would
disperse

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
disperse
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
lease aid so your your schools that are
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
over 30 000 would get more but then the
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
ones that are under 30
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
000 would get less because we would have
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
to prorate
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
because we would run out of money if
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
the total amount of lease aid if we were
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
at the cap
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
would be five hundred and sixty thousand
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
dollars uh the
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
the appropriation was 500 let me make
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
sure i got those numbers right
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
the if we were to apply the 50 000
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
cap we would be giving out 560
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
000 however the appropriation
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
is five hundred thousand dollars
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
therefore we would prorate
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh what was available to schools which
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
would shift
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
the i looked at the list for the schools
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
that applied
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
this year that would mean eight schools
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
would get
 
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
less lease aid and 10 schools would get
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
more lease aid so i just wanted to make
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
that clarification
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps the shift is what you're looking
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
for i'm not here really to comment on
 
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:44.630 align:start position:0%
for i'm not here really to comment on
that

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
or perhaps you're considering a
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
increased appropriation
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
also not here to comment on that but i
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
am the
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh in charge of the lease aid program so
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer questions if you
 
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
have them
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh thank you how would we determine why
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
some would get less
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
well if if the appropriation is 500 000
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
and i need to pay everybody 560 000
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
people would be prorated whatever that
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
comes out to be 85 percent
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
and so those schools um
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
that because those schools that would
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
have originally got
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
the full 30 percent i no longer have
 
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.390 align:start position:0%
the full 30 percent i no longer have
that

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
because i have to cap a greater amount
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
so that money has to come
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
come from somewhere and that money would
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
come off those schools that their
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
30 wasn't met
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that information that
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
is why the intent
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
i think is to retain the bill then when
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
we get to the school budgeting
 
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
we can take a look and see if we can put
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
more in

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
2020 um
 
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
2020 uh for this last year 2021 it was

415 000
 
00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
um which the appropriation was 500 000.
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%

prorate anybody
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
so that was 415 000. the year prior
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal 20 uh we gave out 200 000
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
we had to prorate everybody 44 because
 
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%

at asd which is one of the schools that
 
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.830 align:start position:0%
at asd which is one of the schools that

are
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
part of this bill uh requesting the
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
the funding and i just wanted to say
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
that i really think it is very much
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
worth it it's been an
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
excellent education they operate on a
 
00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.149 align:start position:0%
excellent education they operate on a
shoestring

00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
shoestring
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
it's in a very uh nondescript building
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
on 101a in nashua and if you didn't know
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
it was there you'd fly right by it
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
it looks like an office building they
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
don't have a cafeteria
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
they don't have a gym all those fancy
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
things that you normally
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
associate with a school but they do some
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
amazing things with education
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
she started her education with algebra
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
in the seventh grade she's now taking
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
multi-variable calculus as a senior
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
with uh the instructions she has gotten
 
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
has been phenomenal
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
and some of the classes she's taking i
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
think i've had in my
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
second year of college so it's really
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
prepared her well
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
to go into college and i i really think
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
it's worth
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill i think a lot of
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
these schools are doing very innovative
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
things they meet a need that a little
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
niche me need that isn't necessarily
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
in other places and i really hope you
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
consider that
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
they're doing wonderful things for our
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%

motion thank you mr chairman
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
all money bills in the year of a budget
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
really should go
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
into the budget therefore this bill
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
which requires 10 million dollars should
 
00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.510 align:start position:0%
which requires 10 million dollars should
be

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
retained secondly we heard from mr

donovan

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
donovan
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
that we would have to work out a better
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
way to
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
look at and dispose of the money because
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
of a bill passed in 2016.
 
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor has agreed to work
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
with that and has an idea for
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
an amendment but he like us is going to
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
be tied up with budget hearings very
 
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.109 align:start position:0%
be tied up with budget hearings very
shortly

00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
shortly
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
we also do not have revenue estimates
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
from house ways and means
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
so at this time we don't know what the
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
money is going to be therefore i move to
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
retain mr chairman thank you
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%

ober is recognized to speak from the
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
motion to retain yes thank you mr
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
chairman again this is a money bill
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this bill should really be
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
filed in the second year of the biennium
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
and the prime sponsor puts it into the
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
first year knowing that we
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
are in a budget some years we've
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
retained it some years we have it
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
as i said we do not have revenue
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
estimates for house waste and means
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
therefore it's impossible to know if
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
it's going to fit into the budget or not
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
therefore i would like to ask that we
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
all retain it
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
so that we have a chance to look at the
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
budget see what goes in the budget we
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
the division for eight years have been
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
very supportive of adding more and more
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment into the budget
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
but it is a pandemic year and i think we
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
have to be prudent
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you does
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to speak
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised i'll ask the
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the roll on the motion to
 
00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.069 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the roll on the motion to
retain

00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%

00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
numeric seconds okay there is a second
 
00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.950 align:start position:0%
numeric seconds okay there is a second
representative

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
uber is recognized to speak to the
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
motion thank you mr chairman this bill
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
has two issues number one
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
is the money issue and the lack of
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
revenues which i've spoken to twice
 
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
already so i will not repeat
 
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
the second issue is that the agency
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
presented written testimony saying that
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
failed to include the staffing needs and
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
the money to support the staffing needs
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
to make this happen
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
so if we can retain this prime sponsor
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
is a member of
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
finance so he will be working on the
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
budget with the rest of us
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
but if we retain it that gives him time
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
to work with the agency to work out the
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
needed amendment
 
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
on staffing and the cost of that so that
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
we can move forward in case we
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
do not put this into the budget again i
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
don't know what's in the governor's
 
00:43:46.079 --> 00:43:47.030 align:start position:0%
don't know what's in the governor's
budget

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
frieza v this and it would require some
 
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.630 align:start position:0%
frieza v this and it would require some
hb2

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%

that we have some issues and
 
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
need to work on education funding
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the best way to
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
handle this
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
is to retain this bill and to look at
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
what what the governor is proposing
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
also i'm sure that most of you are aware
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
that the last covid release relief
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%

and until such time as we know
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
from doe what what new hampshire
 
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
will be receiving from this i think it's
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
only prudent
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%

during the covet virus crisis
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things i noted during the
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
testimony when we heard from
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
communities and i was just going through
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
the list that was provided to the full
 
00:47:55.349 --> 00:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
committee i believe
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
last week and i thought with interest i
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
just some of the members of the
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
committee because i know the members pay
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
close attention to
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
not only state issues but their own uh
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
communities and
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
berlin uh to keep them whole if you will
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
is going to be losing over
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
two million dollars in state funding uh
 
00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:17.190 align:start position:0%
two million dollars in state funding uh
other

00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%

uh representative earth's committee
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
uh 1.2 i believe million dollars that it
 
00:48:31.599 --> 00:48:32.390 align:start position:0%
uh 1.2 i believe million dollars that it
was

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
and i i guess the concern is that i
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
think we should move this bill
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
forward uh because communities even if
 
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
you're a senate bill 2
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
town and you go back to a default budget
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to be losing these funds
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
which otherwise would be forthcoming if
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
we move this quickly over to the senate
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's anything else to
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
add other than last week i reached out
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
to the retirement system because i had
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
learned that
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
our retirement contributions are those
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
that the towns and cities are going to
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
be paying
 
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
in this next year are going to be up 20
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
or more over last year so between that
 
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
the retirement increases
 
00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:14.839 align:start position:0%
uh i didn't see these funds being
 
00:49:14.839 --> 00:49:15.990 align:start position:0%
uh i didn't see these funds being
restored

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
restored
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
in the governor's proposal but i would
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
hope that we would
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
not support retain and move this bill
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
quickly over to the senate
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
so the senate could act so some of these
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
towns wouldn't be left out to dry
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
and knowing that these towns are right
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
now trying to get their budgets prepared
 
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
for this upcoming next year
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chairman yeah i understand the
 
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.349 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chairman yeah i understand the
uh

00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
the need to get the money in the hands
 
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
but i think even if we send it to the
 
00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.150 align:start position:0%
but i think even if we send it to the
senate

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't get funded any faster than
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
if it goes through the budget process
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
so i don't know as they'd fast track it
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
either but
 
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
we'll see representative walner
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman weiler um i
 
00:50:01.589 --> 00:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
would just
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
i i think that uh representative
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
lischmann laid out
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of the issues that we're faced
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
with here but right now is when schools
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
are schools are trying to develop their
 
00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:13.829 align:start position:0%
are schools are trying to develop their
budgets

00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
and i think they need some
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
they need some assurance that um to know
 
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
what the state is going to do in the
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
next budget cycle
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
and they need to know that we're moving
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
along with some legislation so
 
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
for that for that reason i would vote
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
against retain
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
and um try to to move this bill along
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
so that it can go over to the senate and
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
obviously there would
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
would be work done on it in the senate
 
00:50:43.359 --> 00:50:44.069 align:start position:0%
would be work done on it in the senate
and

00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
probably in a committee of conference to
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
come up with
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
something that would give our
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
communities the kind of assurance they
 
00:50:51.119 --> 00:50:51.829 align:start position:0%
communities the kind of assurance they
need

00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
in order to make their to plan their
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you um i think 6
 
00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
23 i'm sorry i have another committee
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
um 623 does a lot of things
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
it it gives school districts a two-year
 
00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.390 align:start position:0%
it it gives school districts a two-year
window

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
window
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
with numbers that will support
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
their budgets it also helps out with
 
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
um free and reduced lunch there's an
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
urgency that we
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
really need to get this through so i
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
would please
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
ask you to move this bill forward it's
 
00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:35.990 align:start position:0%
ask you to move this bill forward it's
essential

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
essential
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative petry yes thank
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh yeah speaking of farmington uh matter
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
of fact i'm on the budget committee
 
00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:48.150 align:start position:0%
of fact i'm on the budget committee
there

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
and uh the vote the budget will be voted
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
on next month
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
but what the school board has done they
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
froze the budget
 
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh the part of the budget about about
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
million to million
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
two in the budget to uh to foresee any
 
00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:03.750 align:start position:0%
two in the budget to uh to foresee any
shortfall

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
shortfall
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
it's probably about two dollars on a tax
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
rate so
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
it can be done uh you know it's going to
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
take some fiscal responsibility
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
and uh therefore we should retain this
 
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
you know do it the proper way thank you
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman um
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i thought i had the bill here
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
but the senate
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh i believe is voting on a
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
school funding bill this wednesday or
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
thursday whenever
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to have session and that
 
00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:41.670 align:start position:0%
they're going to have session and that
bill

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh will
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
come over to the house obviously but it
 
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
is uh it's also uh
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
i guess in my opinion that we probably
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
should retain this bill
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
so that we can also combine
 
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
our deliberations with
 
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
what the senate is recommending and so i
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
just asked that we
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
i think i think that overall i realized
 
00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:17.670 align:start position:0%
i think i think that overall i realized
that

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
um the the budgets in some cases
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
are are being voted on um
 
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
but i don't know any school district
 
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be happy
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
once the budget is passed to be able
 
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
to accept additional dollars
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
which of course they have the authority
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
if in fact more money than
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
the comes out so thank you thank you
 
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to see if we have any other
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
hands up and i don't
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
see any so if
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
if we're done with discussion i'll ask
 
00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.000 align:start position:0%

mr chairman the vote is 12 to 9.
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
the motion is adopted to retain the bill
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
and that was our last business for the
 
00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:41.349 align:start position:0%
and that was our last business for the
day

00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
anyone else have anything else to say
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
we will be meeting tomorrow i think
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
we're scheduled to be in the chamber the
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
house chamber
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
to hear the governor's presentation it's
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
at is it 2 30
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
anybody call the correct representative
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
edwards you have your hand up
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman thank you for uh
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
recognizing me i
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
i i just wanted to let the committee
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
know uh with a heads up
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
that uh tomorrow to ways and means i'm
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
introducing house bill 346 with an
 
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.069 align:start position:0%
introducing house bill 346 with an
amendment

00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
i believe ways and means is prepared to
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
execute tomorrow and if they
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
pass it otp then uh it will probably
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
need to come to finance
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
as a second committee bill and i
 
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
from my reading of the calendar we have
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
to vote it out
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh next week so if anyone wants to know
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
more about it i'd be happy to do it
 
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
of course it may make sense to wait
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
until after weizen means votes
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
all right i guess we'll have to try to
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
schedule something before
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
um the thing next week so i
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
don't have much time you think that's
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
the deadline huh
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
well sir i i
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
i feel like i'm in my first term when it
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
comes to reading
 
00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
things like the the deadlines for second
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
committees on bills
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh so i would i would defer to the
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
wisdom that's on this committee
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
but that's my interpretation uh
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody in lba can say i think
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
we'll have more time than next week
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
yeah so if the bill is in ways and means
 
00:57:18.799 --> 00:57:19.190 align:start position:0%
yeah so if the bill is in ways and means
now

00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
and it's been tagged as a second
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
committee bill ways and means would have
 
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
to move it along
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
by the next week's deadline and the
 
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
deadline is for ways and means rather
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
than for us
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
right and then if the bill does uh pass
 
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
the house and get referred to finance
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
you'd have until crossover time yeah the
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
second deadline for bills yeah i would
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
that would be my impression
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
all right i told you there were smarter
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
we have a group of geniuses called the
 
00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.309 align:start position:0%
we have a group of geniuses called the
lba

00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
lba
 
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
so congratulations i'm glad we had a
 
00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:52.799 align:start position:0%
good turnout
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
and everybody's getting better at this
 
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
zoom thing
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
most people were unmuting themselves at
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
just the right time and muting
 
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
themselves while the dog was barking or
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
the phone was ringing
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
so that worked out well and tomorrow
 
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
how many plan to go to concord tomorrow
 
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
well the weather's supposed to be a
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
little better
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%

00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
