well anyway uh first of all
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
I guess I failed to mention this is a
 
00:13:17.949 --> 00:13:17.959 align:start position:0%
fair modification as well
 
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
in my opinion we've all volunteered to
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
get on the best Committee in the house
 
00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
on any given day when we're in a normal
 
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.610 align:start position:0%
on any given day when we're in a normal
circumstance

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
used to be
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
even the lobbyists that didn't have any
 
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.370 align:start position:0%
even the lobbyists that didn't have any
bills

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
but always had the transportation
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
like I said the best committee
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
I've just got a few things to go over
 
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
quick because like I said we've done
 
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
some guests
 
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.990 align:start position:0%
some guests
including

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
um just some recommended
 
00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:52.139 align:start position:0%
that you all know to get started
 
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
I just recommended that you use a single
 
00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
email legislative business
 
00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
I know people have gotten a state one
 
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.470 align:start position:0%
I know people have gotten a state one
but

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459 align:start position:0%
need one
 
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
um dressing decorum
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
although there isn't actually a
 
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
dictates anything up in the Forum
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
we uh we did address professionally we
 
00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:19.019 align:start position:0%
are representing our
 
00:14:19.019 --> 00:14:22.370 align:start position:0%
are representing our
towns

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.329 --> 00:14:26.339 align:start position:0%
uh food coffee lunch breaks it's going
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
to be a little different obviously
 
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:28.740 align:start position:0%
because we are
 
00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:32.519 align:start position:0%
in this situation but as a rule there's
 
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
no food during public hearings for sure
 
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
or exec sessions coffee Etc if you need
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
any drinks or want anything I usually
 
00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
hide mine right underneath the uh the
 
00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
table it just makes for much more
 
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
professional appearance
 
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
uh again the exception for that will be
 
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
obviously for the members that are here
 
00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:53.339 align:start position:0%
in person for our lunch break will be
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
probably eating right here
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh use some electronic devices that's uh
 
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
this one's gone back and forth and I one
 
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
time we were asked as committee members
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
just out of respect for the people that
 
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
are here testifying do not use them
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
during our hearings
 
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:13.380 align:start position:0%

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
of coven as you can see everybody I
 
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:17.820 align:start position:0%

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
reasons only that Candy Crush who are
 
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
three Excel or whatever the union
 
00:15:46.329 --> 00:15:46.339 align:start position:0%
leaders got to say
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
again most of this is common sense but
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
um if and when we do get back to our
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
room which is officially room 203
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
um hopefully sooner than later but we'll
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
see how that goes uh all committee
 
00:16:03.769 --> 00:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
members do have a draw
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
in in our particular room again mention
 
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
it hopefully when that day comes I'll
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:14.689 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
for those members that are here
 
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
obviously there are placards around the
 
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339 align:start position:0%
building in case of an emergency
 
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
and for security we'll deal with that
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:37.050 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.930 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:43.850 align:start position:0%
[Music]
no

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:44.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
just for some of our general rules of
 
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
the balance between the priorities right
 
00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
now we've committed we have 19 members
 
00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
and 10 Republicans nine Democrats
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh committee saving obviously I haven't
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
done it at this point yet
 
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
um I didn't know who was going to be
 
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:02.660 align:start position:0%
here in person right now it's uh
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
first come first serve I'll see how that
 
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
pans out again if we do ever get back in
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
our room then we'll make sure we have an
 
00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:12.839 align:start position:0%
official seating assignment
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
um our typical build topics
 
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
I won't go through that I think you're
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
going to find out in a few minutes from
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
our department heads that are going to
 
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:22.140 align:start position:0%
be here introducing themselves and make
 
00:17:24.289 --> 00:17:24.299 align:start position:0%
a better idea
 
00:17:24.299 --> 00:17:25.870 align:start position:0%
a better idea
and

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.169 --> 00:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
researcher in our system well obviously
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
if you're sending out notices but always
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh if there's any doubt check the
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
calendar that comes out every Thursday
 
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
public hearings I guess that's the most
 
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
important thing we can talk about for
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
those that are new to our committee or
 
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
um the public hearing is just what it
 
00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:57.299 align:start position:0%
says it's a public hearing it's their
 
00:17:59.810 --> 00:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity the citizens of the state to
 
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
come here and let them let us know how
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
they feel on us on a certain build
 
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
again it's our job at that time to to
 
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.890 align:start position:0%
again it's our job at that time to to
listen

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
listen
 
00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:12.059 align:start position:0%
um I've seen members in the past have
 
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
launched way too much C-SPAN they showed
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
up in our committee rooms of the hearing
 
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
thinking they were on
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
Senate investigation committee that's
 
00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
not what we do with the public
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
we don't want to get into debates with
 
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.690 align:start position:0%
we don't want to get into debates with
them

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
what we can do though is ask questions
 
00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
and we certainly
 
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.610 align:start position:0%
and we certainly
um

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
should be doing that
 
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
um all questions will go through the
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
chair and if you haven't been in one of
 
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
these formats you'll see soon how it
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
works uh just about any communication
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
that happens in a committee does go
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
through the chair
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
um if you were a sponsor of a committee
 
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
uh if you're a sponsor of a building
 
00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
committee uh what happens in this
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
situation if you're gonna if the bill is
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
in this committee and you are a sponsor
 
00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:06.299 align:start position:0%
you can introduce the bill once you do
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
introduce it
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
um if you're here you can remain return
 
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
to your seat but you're not going to be
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to participate in any more
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
questioning of anybody's had to buy or
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's only clear if you get one bite at
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
the Apple and that's when you're
 
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
introducing it keep in mind once we have
 
00:19:27.409 --> 00:19:27.419 align:start position:0%
the executive session on that then
 
00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
obviously you can participate with
 
00:19:32.029 --> 00:19:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:35.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
which is an old book it says no action
 
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
on Bill same day as hearing that's
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
traditionally how it's been in the house
 
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
generally we have our public hearings on
 
00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:48.419 align:start position:0%
one day for a bill and then we'll do our
 
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
exact session on a different day the
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
rule did change we are allowed to exec
 
00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:55.220 align:start position:0%
on same day
 
00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
we'll see how that goes
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
take it day by day I have had a
 
00:20:03.049 --> 00:20:03.059 align:start position:0%
discussion with the ranking member on if
 
00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:04.460 align:start position:0%
we do that
 
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
the opportunities for uh caucuses are
 
00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:09.419 align:start position:0%
going to be there
 
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
I'm not planning on that today that some
 
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
will still work out
 
00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
next week I did post
 
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
well when I sent my post in for an
 
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
executive session they actually didn't
 
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
put in the calendar uh still giving us
 
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
the levity to do what you need just to
 
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
here's my voice too by the way I think
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's my first day as chair I'm starting
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
to lose it
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
might have something to do with first
 
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
winning all night last night
 
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.770 align:start position:0%
winning all night last night
um

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.049 --> 00:20:45.059 align:start position:0%
the public has their opportunity to
 
00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:48.299 align:start position:0%
speak at the public hearing nobody from
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
the public will be inputting the
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
executive session without my consent uh
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
occasionally we do look at our
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
department heads of people that may have
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
an answer to a question that's important
 
00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
and allow it but for the most part the
 
00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
executive section is our time to debate
 
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
um amendments prepared by OLS is that
 
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to get into that right now
 
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
if you've got any particular questions
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
on that approach me later I know how it
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
used to be but again with Colvin uh
 
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
things are a little different on the
 
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
amendment process if you've got any
 
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
questions on that we'll let me know
 
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:27.049 align:start position:0%
questions on that we'll let me know
individually

00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:27.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh emotions again for most of us that
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
are returning you get it you know what's
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
going on as far as the Motions that are
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
typical whether it's an expedient to
 
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.510 align:start position:0%
typical whether it's an expedient to
legislate

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
Etc there are others uh for the freshmen
 
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
I guess the easiest thing to do is just
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
to watch and see how this all pans out
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
it won't take long and it's actually an
 
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
interesting process what we do
 
00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.549 align:start position:0%
interesting process what we do
um

00:21:51.549 --> 00:21:51.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
any questions again don't hesitate to
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
ask anybody if it's been around
 
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
but lastly on our executive sessions
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
um again this goes to our freshman more
 
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
than anybody with every bill that we
 
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
vote on in our executive session that
 
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
vote is actually just a recommendation
 
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
to go to the Full House
 
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
every bill that's introduced in the
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
house has to be voted on by the Full
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
House what we do in committee is just
 
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
vote on our recommendation
 
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.070 align:start position:0%
vote on our recommendation
and

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
if at the end of the vote we have to
 
00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:30.539 align:start position:0%
report for the calendar for the benefit
 
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
of everybody else in the house
 
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
we not supposed to call them gloves
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
anymore that's what they are
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
but they're actually officially a
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee report
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
by majority report and sometimes you'll
 
00:22:45.409 --> 00:22:45.419 align:start position:0%
see a Minority Report as well
 
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
and that's just stating the positions of
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee that voted
 
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
each week or each in a certain way
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
we get to votes that are unanimous say
 
00:22:59.570 --> 00:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
we had a 19-0 to recommend ought to pass
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
there is a thing called the consent
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
calendar promotion can be made to move
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
it to consent and that's a group of
 
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
bills that when we get to host session
 
00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
we'll be voted on by the house with one
 
00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:12.419 align:start position:0%
vote instead of going line by line bill
 
00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:15.059 align:start position:0%
by Bill you'll see that for unanimous
 
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
maybe one or two dissenters if there's
 
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:19.340 align:start position:0%
no objection
 
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
and I know that's how they're all going
 
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
to pass out and committee this year so
 
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
because I'm looking at the clock I want
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
to put out a big thanks for our staff Mr
 
00:23:42.409 --> 00:23:42.419 align:start position:0%
Brad Greenland he's our committee
 
00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:46.580 align:start position:0%
researcher and Rebecca Stewart is our
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
committee assistant these people who've
 
00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:52.100 align:start position:0%
helped me out tremendously to get going
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
I asked you have some patience with me I
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
am certainly not the most technological
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
Advanced person you I could build you
 
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
around staircase with my eyes closed but
 
00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
this is a learning curve for me so
 
00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
I hope you can tolerate me answering
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
um what I'll do I've got a few minutes
 
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
so I've got to run over quickly are
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
there any questions from anybody right
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
now before we get into
 
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.890 align:start position:0%
now before we get into
around

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
hi this is representative Sykes oh I'm
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
sorry representative but anyways um
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say I admire your uh
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
optimism and I hope that it all proves
 
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
to be true that's one thing about this
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
committee that we we generally can find
 
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
our way to be
 
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
um cordial and
 
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
really do a good job of examining issues
 
00:25:00.169 --> 00:25:00.179 align:start position:0%
and thank you for that moment
 
00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I know the
 
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
scheduling is been a big challenge for
 
00:25:12.649 --> 00:25:12.659 align:start position:0%
the staff but acknowledging that we're
 
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
meeting this week on a Friday and next
 
00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:16.820 align:start position:0%
week on a Friday do you have any idea
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
for our own scheduling purposes what we
 
00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:22.340 align:start position:0%
might be doing moving forward
 
00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that well as you know
 
00:25:27.529 --> 00:25:27.539 align:start position:0%
usually it's us as a committee to get to
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
decide what day
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
um right now that's the it's the
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
speaker's office because it's all double
 
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
rooms that's actually picking the day
 
00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:38.820 align:start position:0%
that we're allowed to use a room and
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
we've got Friday and next week as well
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
as this week obviously it's not my
 
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
favorite day either
 
00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
I will reach out to the uh speaker's
 
00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
office to get an indication that whether
 
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:50.700 align:start position:0%
we're going to be on Fridays or if it's
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
going to be changing there is a chance
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
it could change in the future because as
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
other other committees finish up their
 
00:25:56.159 --> 00:25:57.230 align:start position:0%
other other committees finish up their
bills

00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:25:59.450 --> 00:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
there are some that only have a handful
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
there might be more rooms available on
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
different days so
 
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
that's the best answer I can give you
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
right now this is the data that we're
 
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
stuck with
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you that helps knowing that there
 
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:19.220 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative Mr chairman uh Mr
 
00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
chairman I was wondering if um you would
 
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
prefer us using the hand raise feature
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that representative
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
Phil I'm just getting used to this
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
format myself I did see representative
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
polariski's hand up so why don't we go
 
00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:44.039 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
um I may still just acknowledge you by
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
voice but at least I can see who does
 
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
the good news is it pops your name to
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
the top of the
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
of The rosters so that you can see
 
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
I look into that actually as soon as we
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
get going on our guest speakers I'm
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
gonna have people shut the blind so we
 
00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:13.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions because I am having
 
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
and seeing none thank you very much
 
00:27:23.159 --> 00:27:23.769 align:start position:0%
and seeing none thank you very much
um

00:27:23.769 --> 00:27:23.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:27.539 align:start position:0%

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:55.860 align:start position:0%
audio for us from this perspective
 
00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:58.140 align:start position:0%

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
for these introductions I was uh just
 
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:07.020 align:start position:0%

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
hold on one second let's see if we can
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%

uh yes I can also um if Dr balucky is
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
promoted to a panelist she will be able
 
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
to share her screen actually Brad could
 
00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:06.059 align:start position:0%
you do that um with Michael Todd he has
 
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
the slides loaded on his computer and he
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
can share his screen
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%

of safety I have been in my position for
 
00:29:27.289 --> 00:29:27.299 align:start position:0%
a little over five years now it's hard
 
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
to believe it just seems like just a
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
couple years ago I was in front of the
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
transportation committee as a newbie and
 
00:29:36.169 --> 00:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
thank you you were all very gracious and
 
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
treated me very well I see a lot of
 
00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
familiar and unfamiliar faces so I'm
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
just hoping that we will develop a
 
00:29:45.649 --> 00:29:45.659 align:start position:0%
really good working relationship I
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
always encourage all representatives and
 
00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
Senators as well as any committee
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
members to reach out to us with any
 
00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
questions related to the DMV
 
00:29:54.659 --> 00:29:55.250 align:start position:0%
questions related to the DMV
um

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
will try our best to help you in any way
 
00:30:00.169 --> 00:30:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
and with that we will try to go rather
 
00:30:06.409 --> 00:30:06.419 align:start position:0%
quickly through our slides I think
 
00:30:08.289 --> 00:30:08.299 align:start position:0%
they're pretty well
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory we can stop or slow
 
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
down at any point Mr chairman if you see
 
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
any questions that come up please feel
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
free to stop me and we'll we can answer
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
them as we go along
 
00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
um I'll just move on to slide number two
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
and share with you the the mission of
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
the DMV you can read through the full
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
version of the of the mission but I
 
00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
simplify it by saying that our mission
 
00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
is to ensure the safety of our drivers
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
the safety of our vehicles and the
 
00:30:39.169 --> 00:30:39.179 align:start position:0%
safety of New Hampshire roadways moving
 
00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
on to slide number three
 
00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
um this is a an org chart of the
 
00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety so you can see that
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
we are one of the divisions of the
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety along with
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
Administration State Police Homeland
 
00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:55.580 align:start position:0%
Security fire standards and emergency
 
00:30:59.810 --> 00:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
services and the division of fire safety
 
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
the next slide provides you with an
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
overview of the DMV and again I won't go
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
into much detail on this slide because
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
we'll move into each Bureau and the
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
following slides
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
so moving on to slide number five here's
 
00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
an overview of the of the DMV's Bureau
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
of operations this is our largest Bureau
 
00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
and these are the people that are
 
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
interacting with our customers face to
 
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
face so the the Bureau of operations is
 
00:31:27.529 --> 00:31:27.539 align:start position:0%
responsible for the processing of any
 
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
type of counter transactions we're
 
00:31:33.409 --> 00:31:33.419 align:start position:0%
Staffing all of our 14 locations we've
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
listed out both the full-time and
 
00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:39.179 align:start position:0%
part-time locations we have about 82
 
00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
full-time employees and 42 part-time
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
employees within the Bureau of
 
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.549 align:start position:0%
employees within the Bureau of
operations

00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:48.889 --> 00:31:48.899 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Licensing these are our
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
road examiners so these are examiners
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
that are administering all types of
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
skill testing for operator licenses
 
00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
commercial licenses as well as
 
00:32:00.649 --> 00:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
motorcycle endorsements we have provided
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
you with just snapshots of numbers so
 
00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
that you have an idea of what numbers
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with so at the end of
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
December of 2020 we had just a little
 
00:32:12.889 --> 00:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
over 1.1 million active licenses then we
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
broke those out into CDL licenses
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
non-driver IDs and real ID compliant
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
slide number seven introduces our Bureau
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
of financial responsibility this Bureau
 
00:32:30.049 --> 00:32:30.059 align:start position:0%
really takes care of anything that ends
 
00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
up on a Motor Vehicle Record so any
 
00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:34.740 align:start position:0%
convictions suspensions violations and
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
again a snapshot of our calendar year
 
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
2020 activities we've processed 57 000
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
driver license suspensions 27 000
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
registration suspensions made by mail
 
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
tickets these would be tickets that are
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
coming through all local PDS and we're
 
00:32:54.909 --> 00:32:54.919 align:start position:0%
actually entering them into our system
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
manually online ticket pay transactions
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
29 000 of those were processed and then
 
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
not guilty please again manual entry but
 
00:33:06.289 --> 00:33:06.299 align:start position:0%
we have some good news with that later
 
00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
slide number eight
 
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
um describes the Bureau of registration
 
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
I know some of you are familiar with Mr
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
ayaluna he is no longer with the DMV he
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
actually moved on to the private sector
 
00:33:24.409 --> 00:33:24.419 align:start position:0%
so Mr obaden Jeff obedank has taken over
 
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
um for Chris and you will have the
 
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
pleasure of hearing him later today
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
our Bureau of registration is
 
00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:32.519 align:start position:0%
responsible for managing all vehicle
 
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
registrations without this within the
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
state that includes all Motor Vehicles
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
automobiles boats or any type trailers
 
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
or any type of vehicles that are
 
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
registered on the road again we're
 
00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
giving you some statistics at the end of
 
00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:48.779 align:start position:0%
December of 2020 1.6 million Vehicles
 
00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:51.380 align:start position:0%
registered this will be again not just
 
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
automobiles but any type of vehicles
 
00:33:57.289 --> 00:33:57.299 align:start position:0%
walking disability plockets 124
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
000 of those one of my favorites is the
 
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:02.220 align:start position:0%
last statistics number of vanity plates
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
issued 167
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
slide number nine introduces the Bureau
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
of title and Anti-Theft
 
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
um the Bureau of title manages anything
 
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:17.460 align:start position:0%
that has to do with the ownership of the
 
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
vehicle they're also involved with a
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
number of national organizations such as
 
00:34:25.369 --> 00:34:25.379 align:start position:0%
ncic and nvidis and you see some of
 
00:34:25.379 --> 00:34:26.470 align:start position:0%
ncic and nvidis and you see some of
those

00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
transactions down below and those just
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
really ensure the safety or relate to
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
any type of crime related to Vehicles so
 
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
those would be notifications of stolen
 
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
vehicles and others where we have to
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
conduct a search of our system to see if
 
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
any of those ended up in New Hampshire
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
this is fiscal year 2020 so it's a
 
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
little bit different Mike later on we'll
 
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:50.700 align:start position:0%
have the statistics for you for a
 
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
calendar year 2020 fiscal 2020 would
 
00:34:58.849 --> 00:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
have ended June 30th of 2020 on 358 000
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
titles that were issued by the Bureau of
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
titles and you have the breakdown
 
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
slide number 10 discusses the director's
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
office so this would be my office as
 
00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:18.380 align:start position:0%
well as the Bureau of audits we really
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
our role is to oversee the entire
 
00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
operation and set a strategic priority
 
00:35:25.849 --> 00:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
for the DMV as well we're responsible
 
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
for the oversight of management of all
 
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
of our employees 199 full-time employees
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
the next slide introduces just some
 
00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
other functions and the first two are
 
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
ones that we share with the um with
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
State Police Troop G driver safety
 
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
education so this is your driver's ed
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
um we have a true court that oversees
 
00:35:55.609 --> 00:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
all of the schools that educate all of
 
00:35:58.970 --> 00:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
our 16 year olds and just ensures that
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
all of the instructors are probably
 
00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
credentials similarly Pupil
 
00:36:04.849 --> 00:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
Transportation Lieutenant player has a
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
trooper in charge of that to oversee a
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
school bus inspection and certification
 
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
of school bus drivers we also provide
 
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
motorcycle motorcycle rider safety
 
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
education so the motorcycle rider
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
training courses within the state and
 
00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:20.220 align:start position:0%
are involved in the National fatal
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
accident reporting system
 
00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:26.339 align:start position:0%
slide number 12 just gives you an idea
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
of all of the different partners and
 
00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
communities that we are involved with
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
and communicate with on a regular basis
 
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
now I will pause right here because this

present to us the total number of decal
 
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
plates that have been issued we spend an
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
awful lot of time on decal plate issues
 
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
and I'd be curious to know how many
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
actual decal plates have been issued
 
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
absolutely we can have that statistics I
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
can I can follow up with the chairman
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
and provide that to him sometime next
 
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:21.650 align:start position:0%

um I wondered if you could skip back to
 
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
I think it was the second slide that you
 
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
showed with the total number of
 
00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
registrations I'd like to take a quick
 
00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:50.690 align:start position:0%
registrations I'd like to take a quick
screenshot

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
oh under Bureau of registrations is it
 
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
this one that
 
00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:56.270 align:start position:0%
this one that
um

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:58.849 --> 00:38:58.859 align:start position:0%
actually it was the one that had the
 
00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
number of licenses issued I think okay
 
00:39:01.619 --> 00:39:03.170 align:start position:0%
number of licenses issued I think okay
sorry

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.180 align:start position:0%

thank you very much for this uh
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%

yes absolutely my pleasure
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
representative Hill did you have a
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
question on this slide
 
00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
I did not I just wanted to see it again
 
00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
oh okay and we do it we did make this
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
presentation available
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
um again we're okay if the chair wants
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
to share this with the committee members
 
00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:38.060 align:start position:0%
four question
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
directoro thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
you director balecki uh could you
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
describe um what the difference is
 
00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Municipal agent and I I didn't
 
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:53.220 align:start position:0%
catch the rest of your question uh an
 
00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
abode agent you I'm not sure what a
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
municipal agent is yep um uh you will
 
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
very quickly know what it is Municipal
 
00:40:02.329 --> 00:40:02.339 align:start position:0%
agents are all of our town and City
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
Clerks that process registrations they
 
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
actually are agents of the state because
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
they own they not only process your town
 
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
registration but they also act in an
 
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
agency capacity and process the state
 
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
portion of the registration as well
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up Mr chair sure and also um
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
how does that differ from a boat agent
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
yep boat agents are typically private or
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
marinas we do have some of our Municipal
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
agents that also process boat
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
registrations and renewals but we've
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
also brought on a number of boat agents
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
only which will be privately owned
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
marinas where you can register your vote
 
00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
if you don't see any other questions
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
directly okay if you don't mind we
 
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
thought that it would be important for
 
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
us to give you an update of really just
 
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
how the pandemic has affected DMV
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
operations and deputy director Michael
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
Todd can bring you through on these
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
good morning can everyone hear me okay
 
00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
yep great thank you very much thank you
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
to I'd like to thank the committee for
 
00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:08.579 align:start position:0%
this opportunity
 
00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:11.940 align:start position:0%
to discuss very briefly how the pandemic
 
00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:13.619 align:start position:0%
has impacted our operations and how the
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
DMV has responded
 
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
just to give you a quick overview of our
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
customer demand has it has changed a bit
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
but you can see that uh in a lot of ways
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
it hasn't it hasn't uh diminished that
 
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
much our customer calls received in 2020
 
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
went up to almost a million calls from
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
about six hundred thousand and twenty of
 
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
the year before from 2019 titles issued
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
and we'll discuss why that is um the
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
title is issued
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
it's comparable there was uh it was a
 
00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:44.339 align:start position:0%
Slowdown in sales and you can see that
 
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
with the titles issued that there's a
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
responsive uh diminishment there but
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
that is not because we haven't met
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
demand that's this is just what the
 
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
demand is a skills test performed uh
 
00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
again there's a a bottleneck of if you
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
will at the driver education programs
 
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
and as they're running their uh their
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
students through we're providing the
 
00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:07.740 align:start position:0%
skill tests there to them but they're
 
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
still you can see we're behind uh the
 
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
program is behind the education programs
 
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
are behind by about 6 000 in comparison
 
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
to last year again though this is this
 
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
is what our demand is and we are meeting
 
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:19.140 align:start position:0%
the demand
 
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
um licenses and ID cards issued at about
 
00:42:23.089 --> 00:42:23.099 align:start position:0%
300 000
 
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
for this year this is what we call a dip
 
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
year and um in 2001 RSA 263 10 was
 
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
changed to modified
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
um so that the the anniversary date to
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
renew your license went from every
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
fourth year of every fifth year and so
 
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
we have a what we call a dip year and
 
00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
this year's our dick here the last dip
 
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
here was 2015 so we gave you the 2015
 
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
number so it was a more comparable
 
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:47.810 align:start position:0%
number so it was a more comparable
number

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:49.140 align:start position:0%
um you can see that the demand for
 
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
licensed system hasn't changed knowledge
 
00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
tests performed 26 000 and then active
 
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
registrations which director Blackie
 
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
so the impact of the pandemic on our
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
operations we did close we did close for
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
two days to transition to appointment
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
only walk-in services in March of 2020.
 
00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
we reopened on that following Monday and
 
00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:17.220 align:start position:0%
uh in person online in person online and
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
phone services CDL tests all continue to
 
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
be available through that time and they
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
continue to be available today we did
 
00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579 align:start position:0%
pause knowledge and Road and motorcycle
 
00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
tests between March and June you'll
 
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
notice our call volume we saw this in
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
the last slide it increased by up to 300
 
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
percent uh during weeks with 6 000 calls
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
per day that's approximately between
 
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
March November we had 50 000 additional
 
00:43:44.809 --> 00:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
calls per month to make up to get us
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
that almost million calls last year and
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
that's because when we transitioned a
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
lot of our services transitioned to
 
00:43:53.329 --> 00:43:53.339 align:start position:0%
phone services so people would call we
 
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
provide what services were available to
 
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
them via the phone they'd have to set up
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
appointments via the phone and um
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
we did Leverage a lot of our staff and
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
put them on the phone systems to respond
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
to that need we did install an online
 
00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.370 align:start position:0%
to that need we did install an online
appointment

00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
um service that's available so people
 
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
can now schedule online you'll see there
 
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
are calls
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
um our calls actually we saw that our
 
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
calls did drop down what's what we
 
00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:20.579 align:start position:0%
normally would expect and you'll see
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
throughout this presentation that we
 
00:44:25.849 --> 00:44:25.859 align:start position:0%
have uh We've the pandemic created new
 
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
challenges we met those challenges and
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
then we continue to push the envelope to
 
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
push forward to create new efficiencies
 
00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:32.579 align:start position:0%
for our customers so we did offer six
 
00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
months extensions for driver licenses
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
over the phone we still offer those
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
extensions for individuals who have
 
00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
particular concerns extenuating
 
00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:42.050 align:start position:0%
particular concerns extenuating
circumstances

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:44:44.089 --> 00:44:44.099 align:start position:0%
automatic extensions for 20-day plates
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
were available from March to may as real
 
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
ID compliance deadline was extended from
 
00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
to October 2021.
 
00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
so on the last slide I talked a little
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
bit about Innovation during the pandemic
 
00:44:59.329 --> 00:44:59.339 align:start position:0%
took the opportunity here we always
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
we're always trying to push forward and
 
00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
make uh provide a better customer
 
00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:05.220 align:start position:0%
service experience during the pandemic
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
it wasn't any different we did
 
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
we did instill or install a covet health
 
00:45:14.089 --> 00:45:14.099 align:start position:0%
safety and remote productivity protocol
 
00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
so essentially no one's coming none of
 
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
our staff come to work sick we ask them
 
00:45:20.089 --> 00:45:20.099 align:start position:0%
a variety of questions we take the
 
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
temperature we make sure that we have a
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
safe and healthy environment in our
 
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
buildings and you can see we haven't had
 
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
to shut down because of covid what
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
you've seen in many states around us
 
00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
where they've had to shut down for
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
extended periods of time because of
 
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
covid it hasn't happened here in New
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we offer Dropbox Services we
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
put the online real ID document Checker
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
I made that available online
 
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
applications for motorcycle rider
 
00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
training in each one of these steps
 
00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:47.339 align:start position:0%
allows our staff to focus on
 
00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
transactions on the more essential
 
00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
transactions to our to our mission and
 
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
allows customers customers to be more
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
efficient with their time and have a
 
00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
better customer service experience
 
00:45:58.849 --> 00:45:58.859 align:start position:0%

road test request system online taking
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
payment the online appointment scheduler
 
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
became available in October we did see a
 
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
a um a drop in our phone cues a
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
considerable dropping our phone cues and
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's right about that when we saw that
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
we our phone please go back to what we
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
we expected pre uh pre-pandemic State
 
00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
Police have been fantastic troop gians
 
00:46:35.329 --> 00:46:35.339 align:start position:0%
with the state policeman's been hats
 
00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
it's fantastic helping with providing
 
00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
CDL testing so that's continued to be
 
00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
available and then the online driver's
 
00:46:44.569 --> 00:46:44.579 align:start position:0%
license renewal update was in December
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
and the online driver's license
 
00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:48.180 align:start position:0%
duplicate in January so all these
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
Services have continued to to provide a
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
better customer service experience even
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
during the challenges of the pandemic
 
00:46:55.849 --> 00:46:55.859 align:start position:0%
allowing us to be custard customer
 
00:46:55.859 --> 00:46:57.230 align:start position:0%
allowing us to be custard customer
demand

00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
demand
 
00:46:59.089 --> 00:46:59.099 align:start position:0%
in comparison to other states we are
 
00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
doing fantastic I would say we're at the
 
00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
top of the Heap you can see in
 
00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
Connecticut they shut down for three
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
months Maine shut down for 2.5 months
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
Vermont five months New Hampshire two
 
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.190 align:start position:0%
Vermont five months New Hampshire two
days

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
and so I have a lot of pride in our
 
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
state I have a lot of pride in the DMV
 
00:47:16.089 --> 00:47:16.099 align:start position:0%
and I can have the numbers to back it up
 
00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
we've done a great job
 
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.510 align:start position:0%
we've done a great job
and

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:22.609 --> 00:47:22.619 align:start position:0%
as far as employment availability goes
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
if it does vary by location but at our
 
00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
full-time locations licensing
 
00:47:28.849 --> 00:47:28.859 align:start position:0%
appointments are available one to three
 
00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
weeks knowledge tests available now to
 
00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
up to two weeks road test two to six
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
weeks we do have we do have a longer
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
wait time for road tests we are putting
 
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
more resources toward processing road
 
00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
and you can see from the customer
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
comments that the customers are
 
00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:49.980 align:start position:0%
very much in favor of the appointment
 
00:47:52.609 --> 00:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
system provides a lot of a lot of
 
00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
convenience for them and it's it's good
 
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
for the DMV it's good for our customers
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
so it's a win-win all the way around and
 
00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
you can it's not just the appointment
 
00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
system though it's not just these these
 
00:48:05.809 --> 00:48:05.819 align:start position:0%
uh these Innovations online that are
 
00:48:07.809 --> 00:48:07.819 align:start position:0%
that we're proud of it's our staff
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
innovation's online are great but they
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
don't mean as much they don't mean
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
really much of anything our staff aren't
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
there to help provide those Services
 
00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:16.140 align:start position:0%
when they arrive you can see in here
 
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
they talk about the stats patient very
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
well organized very efficient the
 
00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:20.579 align:start position:0%
Personnel were very helpful and
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
professional great job it was a surprise
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
is satisfied with my visit people have
 
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
good experiences when they come to the
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
DMV and it's because of the staff
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
very thankful for that
 
00:48:34.609 --> 00:48:34.619 align:start position:0%
so some of the constraints during covid
 
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
we do have a 15 percent we did have 15
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
vacancies and now with waivers we're
 
00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
down to 13 vacancies it's still a
 
00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
challenge and then of course absences
 
00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
you'll see in January and February those
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
are kind of our high points for absences
 
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
in a normal year because it's the flu
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
season but you'll see every other month
 
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic every month
 
00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
after uh March we actually exceeded what
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
we would normally see for our high
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
number of vacancies for the year so it's
 
00:49:03.309 --> 00:49:03.319 align:start position:0%
it's a big challenge obviously in April
 
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
April and May June or sorry April and
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
May of uh of last year was a it was a
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
massive challenge these are all the
 
00:49:11.809 --> 00:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
constraints we are dealing with but we
 
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
are meeting those these um these
 
00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
this is our current availability of
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
services we do have our we do have
 
00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
Milford opening up in mid-February we
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
also have uh Tamworth available in early
 
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
February so we're continuing to expand
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
and again you can see that even though
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
we have the challenges of the pandemic
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
and the challenges of Staffing we are
 
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
offering services to our customers with
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
its customers first we always want to
 
00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:40.740 align:start position:0%
get to yes for each customer and we're
 
00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
doing that we're doing that for the best
 
00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
of our ability and I think we're
 
00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:45.890 align:start position:0%
of our ability and I think we're
succeeding

00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
succeeding
 
00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
so the next steps we want to make sure
 
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
we're filling our banking positions
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
continuing to do that increase
 
00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
employment capacity which you can see
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
that we're we are um we are able to do
 
00:49:59.089 --> 00:49:59.099 align:start position:0%
that and we are doing that and then we
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
want to reopen the Milford and Tamworth
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
locations for in-person appointments
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
which what's your plan for for next
 
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:07.190 align:start position:0%
which what's your plan for for next
month

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
some online customer service initiatives
 
00:50:10.609 --> 00:50:10.619 align:start position:0%
this this is a little more detail on
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
some of the items we've already covered
 
00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:14.700 align:start position:0%
but you can see in 2020 we delivered in
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
the online real ID document Checker
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
motorcycle rider training sign up which
 
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
allows our our MRT is a very popular
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
program allows the applicants to sign up
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
online and complete the paperwork online
 
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
on their own rather than having to have
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know passing paper back and forth
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
and having to have
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
additional phone calls with staff so it
 
00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:35.099 align:start position:0%
frees us up to do other transactions and
 
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
allows the customer to get in and out to
 
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:38.940 align:start position:0%

October which is a a large deliverable
 
00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
that really helped improve the customer
 
00:50:56.569 --> 00:50:56.579 align:start position:0%
experience and also the our the ability
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
of our staff to return to their normal
 
00:50:59.930 --> 00:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
duties get them off the phones to get
 
00:51:01.849 --> 00:51:01.859 align:start position:0%
our transactions flowing and then the

the electronic title leans there's an
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
RFI out for that right now like
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
electronic temporary plates electronic
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
title applications all these all these
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%

convenience
um

thank you Mr chairman uh director Todd

thank you very much for this overview a
 
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
quick question I have for you with the
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
appointment schedule how much ahead of
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
right now we're an individual can make
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
an appointment
 
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
um about 45 days we're uh we're
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
continually looking at that and seeing
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
if there needs if that needs to be
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
increased but right now it seems to be
 
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:52.329 --> 00:52:52.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you um I actually have
 
00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
two quick questions one is I'm curious
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
how many customers are
 
00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.370 align:start position:0%
how many customers are
um

00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
participating in the online registration
 
00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:05.240 align:start position:0%
system as opposed to the call-in
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
registration system I was unaware that
 
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
you guys had launched an online
 
00:53:11.329 --> 00:53:11.339 align:start position:0%
scheduling service and then second if
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
you have any information on the actual
 
00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:17.579 align:start position:0%
in-person turnaround time from start to
 
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
finish once a person arrives for their
 
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
appointment are you seeing improvements
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
in that as opposed to the drop-in system
 
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
that you've had up to this point thank
 
00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:28.609 align:start position:0%
that you've had up to this point thank
you

00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pilerski so
 
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
I'll go back to us the customer comments
 
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
here you can see one of the customer
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
comments the individual says they were
 
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
in and out in 15 minutes and that is
 
00:53:41.809 --> 00:53:41.819 align:start position:0%
what the that is what the standard time
 
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
is for a transaction you hit the door at
 
00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
you know and you're out with your
 
00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
transaction completed in about 15
 
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
minutes sometimes 20. so the convenience
 
00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:53.339 align:start position:0%
to the customers is incredible they
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
don't have to take as much time off from
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
work they don't have to you know
 
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever it is that they would
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
normally do during their during their
 
00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
day they don't have to take time off to
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
um or much time off to do that they can
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
come in and be out in 20 minutes so it's
 
00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
a large convenience for the customer
 
00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
and as far as the number of people using
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
the online appointment scheduler it's
 
00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
it's significant I don't know the exact
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
figure but I would say it's got to be
 
00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
more than 80 percent I would say upwards
 
00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
of 90 are using the online schedule or
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
schedule their own appointments
 
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
thank you those are wonderful
 
00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:31.190 align:start position:0%

front of you and you can see that we are
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
dedicated to maintaining the highest
 
00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:50.700 align:start position:0%
degree of law enforcement service
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire
 
00:57:53.089 --> 00:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
while maintaining the traditions of
 
00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
fairness professionals integrity that's
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
something that we pick take to hard as
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
troopers and we know it from the day
 
00:57:59.569 --> 00:57:59.579 align:start position:0%
that we come on
 
00:58:01.549 --> 00:58:01.559 align:start position:0%
um the state police as a whole is
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
typically comprised of 340 Troopers
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
we're down approximately 30 Troopers as
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
of today uh due to uh due to retirements
 
00:58:13.549 --> 00:58:13.559 align:start position:0%
and uh some budgeting with covid trying
 
00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
to uh anticipate vegetarian shortfalls
 
00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
right now we're down about 30 Troopers
 
00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
the division as a whole is made up of
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
seven troops in addition to
 
00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
investigative and Specialty units and
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
our jurisdiction actually is derived
 
00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559 align:start position:0%
from RSA 106 B colon 12. uh there's a
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
quick visual on the side that shows the
 
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the different troops as you
 
00:58:35.809 --> 00:58:35.819 align:start position:0%
can see troop G's in the purple and we
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
actually covered the entire state
 
00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
we're a little bit different than uh a
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
lot of the other troops uh our mission
 
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
is different where we're not covering a
 
00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:47.460 align:start position:0%
particular Road or a particular town or
 
00:58:50.329 --> 00:58:50.339 align:start position:0%
County doing what's considered normal
 
00:58:52.609 --> 00:58:52.619 align:start position:0%
police work where a non-traditional law
 
00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement entity of the State Police
 
00:58:57.530 --> 00:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
uh we're actually our Barracks is
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
located within the Division of Motor
 
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
Vehicles building in Concord uh it works
 
00:59:03.289 --> 00:59:03.299 align:start position:0%
very well for us because it just allows
 
00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
for a much uh better flow of
 
00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:07.140 align:start position:0%
communication between our two
 
00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
organizations there's actually three
 
00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
primary sections of Troop G the
 
00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
commercial Motor Vehicle Enforcement
 
00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:13.910 align:start position:0%
commercial Motor Vehicle Enforcement
unit

00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
the field enforcement unit and the DMV
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
task force and uh
 
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
what we do is we really govern the
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
administrative laws and rules governing
 
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
safety inspections sale of vehicles as
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
well as Federal commercial uh or as well
 
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
as federal regulations governing
 
00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
commercial motor vehicles and then
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
there's a number of other tasks that we
 
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
do to assist the Division of Motor
 
00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.109 align:start position:0%
do to assist the Division of Motor
Vehicles

00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
Vehicles
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh so what makes us different is we're
 
00:59:41.809 --> 00:59:41.819 align:start position:0%
we're slated to have 47 Troopers uh as
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
well as two auxiliary Troopers which are
 
00:59:45.049 --> 00:59:45.059 align:start position:0%
our part-time Troopers are actually
 
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
retired from the state police and came
 
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
back to assist with our mission and then
 
00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
we have 12 civilians I will tell you
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
right now due to uh due to some of the
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
the stuff that's going on we're down
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
seven Troopers as of today uh and we've
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
have we've had a few other folks that
 
01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
are uh temporarily assigned elsewhere
 
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
within the division to try and meet
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
demands that the organization is facing
 
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
we have a number of uh daily
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities uh as I said we cover
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
the entire State we work with a number
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%

organizations that represent those
 
01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:26.460 align:start position:0%
industries that we govern
 
01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:29.240 align:start position:0%

01:00:58.490 --> 01:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
inspection certification program so all
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
the mechanics that actually conduct the
 
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
state inspections we host a uh
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
information session for them we
 
01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
presented that and then we actually go
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
out and do field tests of each mechanic
 
01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
we locate and serve those that are are
 
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
deemed to be habitual offenders and need
 
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
a noted need a hearing for for that
 
01:01:20.089 --> 01:01:20.099 align:start position:0%

violations against vehicle dealers and
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
inspection stations uh we conduct
 
01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
Salvage inspections of vehicles that
 
01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
have been deemed a total loss by the
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
um when those vehicles are repaired and
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
placed back on the roadway we do an
 
01:01:41.569 --> 01:01:41.579 align:start position:0%
inspection of those to make sure there's
 
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
not fraud and that the vehicles are uh
 
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
are put together in a safe fashion
 
01:01:47.809 --> 01:01:47.819 align:start position:0%
uh we also review Vehicles seeking New
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state issued bins as well as
 
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement involves State and criminal
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicle Laws and then in addition
 
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
we also make sure to assist local police
 
01:01:57.049 --> 01:01:57.059 align:start position:0%
departments that need assistance in
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
these areas of assistance as well right
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
these types of Investigations
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh in addition we have an investigations
 
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
unit that's actually located on the
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
second floor of the Division of Motor
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
Vehicles they are uh it's it's supposed
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
to be staffed by a detective sergeant
 
01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
and Three Investigators again we have
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
some staff that is uh temporarily
 
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
assigned elsewhere so we are down on on
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
some of those that staff as well
 
01:02:20.569 --> 01:02:20.579 align:start position:0%
um but they are primarily responsible
 
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
for investigating title fraud uh
 
01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
internal fraud that occurs at the
 
01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
Division of Motor Vehicles unfortunately
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
we don't see very much of that at all so

Vehicle Enforcement
 
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
uh The Authority for the the commercial
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicle Enforcement actually comes
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
from RSA 266 72-a paragraph b
 
01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:40.140 align:start position:0%
um paragraph five the inspections
 
01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
Encompass the vehicle components the
 
01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:44.700 align:start position:0%
driver's fiscal physical condition cargo
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
condition and documentation so to make
 
01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
sure they have uh the proper licensing
 
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
that they are complying with hours of
 
01:05:53.089 --> 01:05:53.099 align:start position:0%
service uh Troopers actually have the
 
01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
authority to place drivers and vehicles
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
out of service uh for specifically
 
01:05:59.569 --> 01:05:59.579 align:start position:0%
defined violations of adopted Federal
 
01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
Regulations the inspections are then
 
01:06:03.890 --> 01:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
uploaded once they're complete into a
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
database which is available to law
 
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
enforcement throughout the country
 
01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
almost immediately and those inspections
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
are actually used to build a company
 
01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:13.619 align:start position:0%
safety profile so if a carrier has a
 
01:06:15.049 --> 01:06:15.059 align:start position:0%
inspection where there's no violations
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
found their safety rating goes up
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
whereas if you go and conduct an
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
inspection and numerous violations are
 
01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
found that could negatively impact us
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
carrier safety profile
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a quick rundown there's a
 
01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
lot that we do but I'm open to any
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%

01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:50.210 align:start position:0%
 
happens

01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh just uh director be lucky
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%

01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%

quickest and easiest way to reach us and
 
01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:18.180 align:start position:0%

um let's see
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
I have actually asked the presentations
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
to be about 10-15 minutes just a summary
 
01:07:50.569 --> 01:07:50.579 align:start position:0%
of that information probably didn't get
 
01:07:53.089 --> 01:07:53.099 align:start position:0%
out so that's my fault
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
I want to face with a public Hearing in
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
15 minutes
 
01:07:58.849 --> 01:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
I allowed a DMV to go through their
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
whole presentation because they in fact
 
01:08:02.089 --> 01:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
deal with them probably 80 of the time
 
01:08:04.329 --> 01:08:04.339 align:start position:0%
well with Department of Safety
 
01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:06.839 align:start position:0%
uh but in terms of the Department of
 
01:08:06.839 --> 01:08:08.329 align:start position:0%
uh but in terms of the Department of

01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know I wouldn't mind
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
rescheduling it can we get them on to
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
see if a rescheduling would be okay with
 
01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:19.490 align:start position:0%
see if a rescheduling would be okay with
them

01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:19.500 align:start position:0%

we really defer to um to you we're happy
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
to keep our remarks brief this morning
 
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
or to reschedule so there's more time to
 
01:08:59.930 --> 01:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
go through our materials
 
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:03.060 align:start position:0%

01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
be okay what do we reschedule rather
 
01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
than try to abbreviate it that much
 
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
that's quite all right um we recognize
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
that you might have questions as well so
 
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
we'd rather not be rushed and make sure
 
01:09:22.249 --> 01:09:22.259 align:start position:0%
we address everything that the committee
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
might want us to cover
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:35.580 align:start position:0%

president of government relations for
 
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Auto Dealers
 
01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:40.790 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Auto Dealers
Association

01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
Association
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
I did send you all a fact sheet
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday with my contact information
 
01:10:47.689 --> 01:10:47.699 align:start position:0%
and also some info to speed up this uh
 
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
introduction so nhada is a trade group
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
that represents the motor vehicle
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
industry we are over 500 businesses that
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
are car trucks snowmobile ATV
 
01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
construction farm equipment
 
01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
um and body shops in all corners of the
 
01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
state in every Community uh we have
 
01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
about 14 000 employees and make up about
 
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
a quarter of the retail sales uh in New
 
01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we are both franchise and
 
01:11:14.689 --> 01:11:14.699 align:start position:0%
independent members we actually have
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
more independent businesses than um
 
01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
franchise members so two important
 
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
things about nhada is that a Cornerstone
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
issue for us is roadway safety we
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
believe in safe roads a safe motoring
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
public through things like the annual
 
01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
inspection program the ban on texting
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
while driving motorcycle rider education
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
and the traffic safety Commission of
 
01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
which we're a member and I know you'll
 
01:11:42.169 --> 01:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
have a bill on later in the the session
 
01:11:44.689 --> 01:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
um another important program we run is
 
01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
an autocap program which is a Consumer
 
01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
complaint program and I point this out
 
01:11:50.689 --> 01:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
because if you have a constituent that
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
calls our autocap program can certainly
 
01:11:56.330 --> 01:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
help you a lot of times complaints
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
against dealers or inspection stations
 
01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:00.900 align:start position:0%
is really just miscommunication or
 
01:12:03.169 --> 01:12:03.179 align:start position:0%
misinformation they didn't know what
 
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
tires for Life meant or the salesman
 
01:12:08.209 --> 01:12:08.219 align:start position:0%
didn't know salesperson didn't know they
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
wanted two names on the title uh not one
 
01:12:12.649 --> 01:12:12.659 align:start position:0%
in which order they should be in so we
 
01:12:14.689 --> 01:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
can help mediate those
 
01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
um those confusions or conflicts that
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
come up it's an independent panel the
 
01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
results are binding on the dealer
 
01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
they're not on the consumer and if the
 
01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
dealer doesn't abide by the decision we
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
have the option to throw them out of our
 
01:12:30.649 --> 01:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
association they lose their health care
 
01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
benefits the workers comp benefits uh
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
things like that so the Attorney General
 
01:12:38.810 --> 01:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
sends about 200 um cases a year over to
 
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
us so I think it shows their confidence
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
in our resolutions system so that
 
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
information can be handy if you have
 
01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:48.290 align:start position:0%
information can be handy if you have
um

01:12:48.290 --> 01:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh constituent issues so throughout the
 
01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
session you'll hear from from me from us
 
01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
uh from our possibly our president Pete
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
McNamara and then uh many of our members
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
who really are the true experts who are
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
in the field who are in the trenches uh
 
01:13:04.729 --> 01:13:04.739 align:start position:0%
doing this every day uh you'll hear from
 
01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
us on a variety of bills
 
01:13:10.729 --> 01:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
um especially HB 522 which will modify
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
the or propose to modify the annual
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
inspection program uh we currently have
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
an over 15 percent failure rate with an
 
01:13:21.649 --> 01:13:21.659 align:start position:0%
annual program so extending that in our
 
01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
opinion is something
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
um that's a just an unsafe change in
 
01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:26.810 align:start position:0%
um that's a just an unsafe change in
policy

01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:13:28.970 --> 01:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
um I was pleased to see the presentation
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
by the DMV and dos we are partners with
 
01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
them and we were very very closely
 
01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
um I would like to give some kudos to
 
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
director bialeki
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
um and and uh Michael Todd as well and
 
01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
their team
 
01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:47.699 align:start position:0%
um their operations during during covid
 
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
were unparalleled uh you saw that when
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
they mentioned that uh they were the
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
only DMV around
 
01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
um to have a only a two-day shutdown so
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
they really deserve a tremendous amount
 
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
of kudos for the businesses and the
 
01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state
 
01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
um you know during the original uh
 
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
shutdown vehicle sales and service were
 
01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
deemed by the governor to be essential
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
services so our workload
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
um and our needs at the DMV never shut
 
01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
that slowed down whether it was for
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
title turnaround the buying and selling
 
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
of operations of businesses inspections
 
01:14:23.689 --> 01:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
and things like that they handled it in
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
a highly efficient manner
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
um and shifted when they needed to
 
01:14:28.679 --> 01:14:29.390 align:start position:0%
um and shifted when they needed to
um

01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to point to we had an
 
01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:33.420 align:start position:0%

dealership uh two of them actually
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%

01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
meeting with the DMV the comment by this
 
01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
out-of-state dealer was I wish all New

01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I just have one question
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:26.780 align:start position:0%
uh two and a half
 
01:15:29.689 --> 01:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
yeah just kidding uh any other questions
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:39.300 align:start position:0%

01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
so what's up okay
 
01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
um I apologize again for the confusion
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
and in the communication gap but that's
 
01:15:54.410 --> 01:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
okay we can reschedule the other two
 
01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
speakers at a later time probably just
 
01:15:58.250 --> 01:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
zoom rather than trying to schedule
 
01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
another day in this room
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
um I figured it would be only fair so
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
they could go through their whole
 
01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:04.250 align:start position:0%
they could go through their whole
routine

01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
routine
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%

uh it passed last year unanimously I
 
01:31:05.810 --> 01:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
sent you guys all an email
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
um with the picture of the emblem of the
 
01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:11.100 align:start position:0%

to the plates uh for the Knights of
 
01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
Columbus the money for this uh raised
 
01:31:18.649 --> 01:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
from selling these decals to our members
 
01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
and members only or our members families
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
would go to the Nephrology program at
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock which the Knights of
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
Columbus have supported for decades now
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
um previously we supported people on
 
01:31:39.649 --> 01:31:39.659 align:start position:0%
dialysis with their unpaid uh
 
01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
secondary expenses you know like things
 
01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:43.209 align:start position:0%
secondary expenses you know like things
like

01:31:43.209 --> 01:31:43.219 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:31:45.410 --> 01:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
antacids and some medicines that weren't
 
01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
covered for Indigent people and we're
 
01:31:51.169 --> 01:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
extending this to uh kidney transplants
 
01:31:51.179 --> 01:31:52.370 align:start position:0%
extending this to uh kidney transplants
so

01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
we need to raise a little bit more money
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
and this was one way we could do it
 
01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:09.229 --> 01:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
I can't hear you
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
down here scroll down
 
01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
I see oh I see one representative Sykes
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman representative
 
01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
early just to cover our bases
 
01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:26.810 align:start position:0%
early just to cover our bases
um

01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:28.729 --> 01:32:28.739 align:start position:0%
one of the requirements of this bill is
 
01:32:31.250 --> 01:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
the tax status of an organization could
 
01:32:33.290 --> 01:32:33.300 align:start position:0%
you just remind me what the tax status
 
01:32:36.290 --> 01:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
is of the Knights of Columbus Knights of
 
01:32:40.930 --> 01:32:40.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:03.649 --> 01:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
yeah just if anybody have to speak as
 
01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
representative said this didn't pass
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
unanimously on the committee last year
 
01:33:09.169 --> 01:33:09.179 align:start position:0%
it didn't uh go through the house I
 
01:33:10.729 --> 01:33:10.739 align:start position:0%
believe it was on consent it should have
 
01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
been like
 
01:33:13.850 --> 01:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
um and unfortunately he went to the
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
Senate at the cross over again that's
 
01:33:19.610 --> 01:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
when covid-19 struck so if you remember
 
01:33:21.709 --> 01:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
for those of you here those that were
 
01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
new what the Senate did
 
01:33:27.050 --> 01:33:27.060 align:start position:0%
um you know in that circumstance they
 
01:33:28.850 --> 01:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
just picked the bills they thought had a
 
01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
yet most important created the Omnibus
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
bills uh in that group we dealt with for
 
01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
the rest of the session unfortunately
 
01:33:37.370 --> 01:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
this one didn't make it and that's why
 
01:33:39.050 --> 01:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
it's been reintroduced
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
um but it's also why I picked it for the
 
01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
first one of the year I figured it would
 
01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
be an easier so
 
01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:45.780 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the committee
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:55.729 --> 01:33:55.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this actually is just
 
01:33:57.530 --> 01:33:57.540 align:start position:0%
an inquiry for you
 
01:33:59.629 --> 01:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
um but also we'll come across it in the
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
next hearing when we discuss the request
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
from the Masons they both state on the
 
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
bill that uh on line three that they'll
 
01:34:12.649 --> 01:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
be number 16 of organizations added to
 
01:34:13.850 --> 01:34:13.860 align:start position:0%
the list
 
01:34:15.410 --> 01:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
um obviously if we approve both of these
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
as written they would contradict each
 
01:34:18.649 --> 01:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
other is that something that will
 
01:34:20.930 --> 01:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
automatically be taken care of or would
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
we need to amend one of them to change
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
one of them to 17 on the list
 
01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
it's a good pickup I would suspect that
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
could be corrected but I will double
 
01:34:36.770 --> 01:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
check before we execute and if we do
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
need to get the amendment I chose is one
 
01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:40.070 align:start position:0%
need to get the amendment I chose is one
available

01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the typo category to me
 
01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
and they can usually fix things like
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
that when the bills are enrolled
 
01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:50.410 align:start position:0%
that when the bills are enrolled
sure

01:34:50.410 --> 01:34:50.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%

01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know what we haven't closed which
 
01:35:02.689 --> 01:35:02.699 align:start position:0%
is good um that's the only person I had
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%

01:35:07.129 --> 01:35:07.139 align:start position:0%

02:01:05.390 --> 02:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
very similar to the last bill
 
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
um again this past last year
 
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
believe unanimously on consent and off
 
02:01:13.250 --> 02:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
to the Senate once again it didn't rise
 
02:01:14.810 --> 02:01:14.820 align:start position:0%
to the level of importance to make it to
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
a senate on the west bill due to covet
 
02:01:20.990 --> 02:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
19. so it's been reintroduced
 
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:21.770 align:start position:0%
19. so it's been reintroduced
um

02:01:21.770 --> 02:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:24.169 --> 02:01:24.179 align:start position:0%
to representative Pulaski I was looking
 
02:01:25.689 --> 02:01:25.699 align:start position:0%
at this after
 
02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
well during the break you know it's a
 
02:01:29.689 --> 02:01:29.699 align:start position:0%
good catch
 
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
and still confirm it but I would imagine
 
02:01:34.490 --> 02:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
that OLS would have to put the next line
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
available on both of these bills not
 
02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
knowing that one or the other may not
 
02:01:42.890 --> 02:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
make it so 99 certain that'll be taken
 
02:01:44.750 --> 02:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
care of an enrolled bills and I will
 
02:01:46.010 --> 02:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
double check
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
with an observation
 
02:01:50.570 --> 02:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
um any questions from the committee
 
02:01:50.580 --> 02:02:13.689 align:start position:0%
um any questions from the committee
um 451.

02:02:13.689 --> 02:02:13.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry I couldn't hear you
 
02:02:19.189 --> 02:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
um just double checking and clarifying
 
02:02:21.109 --> 02:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
this was exactly the same situation as
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
our previous bill that it went through
 
02:02:24.589 --> 02:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
the house um on the consent calendar
 
02:02:24.599 --> 02:02:25.669 align:start position:0%
the house um on the consent calendar
also

02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:02:27.770 --> 02:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct thank you I just
 
02:02:27.780 --> 02:02:28.490 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct thank you I just
wanted

02:02:28.490 --> 02:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
to consent but it did pass the house
 
02:02:36.589 --> 02:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:41.810 --> 02:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:45.890 --> 02:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:47.570 --> 02:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
maybe we didn't want people to make it
 
02:02:50.209 --> 02:02:50.219 align:start position:0%
so I had to replace a chair introduce
 
02:02:52.729 --> 02:02:52.739 align:start position:0%
the bill for you okay are you here if
 
02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:54.300 align:start position:0%
you'd like to speak to it
 
02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:59.390 align:start position:0%
you'd like to speak to it
um

02:02:59.390 --> 02:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
because sit here
 
02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:14.510 --> 02:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
you're not me or Mike it may not be a
 
02:03:16.129 --> 02:03:16.139 align:start position:0%
lot of your life
 
02:03:18.530 --> 02:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
well this is getting complicated yes it
 
02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:21.169 align:start position:0%
well this is getting complicated yes it
is

02:03:21.169 --> 02:03:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:26.810 --> 02:03:26.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that's what I'd call them
 
02:03:28.970 --> 02:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
Larry but
 
02:03:28.980 --> 02:03:33.350 align:start position:0%
Larry but
uh

02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.709 --> 02:03:35.719 align:start position:0%
honestly I don't even want what's
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
51. okay thank you well uh as I'm sure
 
02:03:42.830 --> 02:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
you've explained this is a bill we put
 
02:03:45.530 --> 02:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
in last year just allows
 
02:03:49.129 --> 02:03:49.139 align:start position:0%
uh for the decals for Miss Sonic
 
02:03:52.129 --> 02:03:52.139 align:start position:0%
to be on the plate it passed last year I
 
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
think it came in actually if I remember
 
02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:55.250 align:start position:0%
think it came in actually if I remember
correctly

02:03:55.250 --> 02:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
02:03:57.290 --> 02:03:57.300 align:start position:0%
and then it can hung up over in the
 
02:04:00.169 --> 02:04:00.179 align:start position:0%
Senate with the uh when we went into
 
02:04:02.209 --> 02:04:02.219 align:start position:0%
covert lockdown
 
02:04:06.169 --> 02:04:06.179 align:start position:0%
so I would just ask that this committee
 
02:04:09.169 --> 02:04:09.179 align:start position:0%
once again unanimously approves it
 
02:04:11.390 --> 02:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
sends it on its way
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
so that uh
 
02:04:15.649 --> 02:04:15.659 align:start position:0%
all the Masons in New Hampshire if they
 
02:04:15.659 --> 02:04:16.609 align:start position:0%
all the Masons in New Hampshire if they
choose

02:04:16.609 --> 02:04:16.619 align:start position:0%
choose
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
you can have the Masonic emblem on the
 
02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:22.189 align:start position:0%
you can have the Masonic emblem on the
flight

02:04:22.189 --> 02:04:22.199 align:start position:0%

Bill 361 do not pull up the world star
 
02:27:49.309 --> 02:27:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:51.110 --> 02:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
there's been a brand
 
02:27:54.050 --> 02:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
with my Prime sponsor
 
02:27:57.710 --> 02:27:57.720 align:start position:0%

here can you hear me representative
Graham

02:28:00.950 --> 02:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
Graham
 
02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh for the record
 
02:28:06.170 --> 02:28:06.180 align:start position:0%
I'm representative John Graham
 
02:28:09.530 --> 02:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
I represent Hillsboro district 7 which
 
02:28:11.330 --> 02:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
is the town of Bedford
 
02:28:14.270 --> 02:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
I bring this bill forward
 
02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
in order to give some
 
02:28:20.750 --> 02:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
honor to those family Matt family
 
02:28:23.770 --> 02:28:23.780 align:start position:0%
members who have lost a service member
 
02:28:27.650 --> 02:28:27.660 align:start position:0%
in uh defense of our nation what it
 
02:28:31.250 --> 02:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
would do is wave the ten dollar fee for
 
02:28:33.710 --> 02:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
the gold star decal that is placed on
 
02:28:33.720 --> 02:28:35.230 align:start position:0%
the gold star decal that is placed on
plates

02:28:35.230 --> 02:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
plates
 
02:28:38.809 --> 02:28:38.819 align:start position:0%
the overall economic impact of this is
 
02:28:42.110 --> 02:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
minuscule since the law was passed we've
 
02:28:46.130 --> 02:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
sold I think it is nine uh sets of
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
decals at ten dollars each
 
02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:49.730 align:start position:0%
decals at ten dollars each
um

02:28:49.730 --> 02:28:49.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:53.150 --> 02:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
and the department will testify after me
 
02:28:55.370 --> 02:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
talking about the fact that they feel
 
02:28:58.370 --> 02:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
that they can absorb this relatively
 
02:28:58.380 --> 02:28:59.929 align:start position:0%
that they can absorb this relatively
minor

02:28:59.929 --> 02:28:59.939 align:start position:0%
minor
 
02:28:59.939 --> 02:29:01.670 align:start position:0%
minor
um

02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:04.610 --> 02:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
expense and I think that it is the right
 
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
way to go that we honor these families
 
02:29:11.150 --> 02:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
who have who have suffered and I would
 
02:29:14.410 --> 02:29:14.420 align:start position:0%
ask that you ought to pass on House Bill
 
02:29:16.730 --> 02:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
what's the number what's the number of
 
02:29:18.309 --> 02:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
this one
 
02:29:21.710 --> 02:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
361. thank you I'm glad to see one
 
02:29:25.150 --> 02:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
committee's on time today anyways
 
02:29:29.809 --> 02:29:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:31.610 --> 02:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
I'm getting
 
02:29:34.010 --> 02:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:29:34.020 --> 02:29:34.670 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

02:29:34.670 --> 02:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
um

represent Graham
 
02:29:39.710 --> 02:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
can you hear me I hear you
 
02:29:43.870 --> 02:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
thank you listen it says in uh line two
 
02:29:47.450 --> 02:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
paragraph three or section three
 
02:29:49.130 --> 02:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and
 
02:29:52.309 --> 02:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
Veterans Services etc etc issue the cows
 
02:29:54.770 --> 02:29:54.780 align:start position:0%
veterans who qualify under this chapter
 
02:29:56.990 --> 02:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
and shall collect a fee of ten dollars
 
02:29:59.809 --> 02:29:59.819 align:start position:0%
for the set of the cows but you stated
 
02:30:01.429 --> 02:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
that they would waive that ten dollar
 
02:30:06.530 --> 02:30:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:08.690 --> 02:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
um let me pull it up I don't have it in
 
02:30:10.190 --> 02:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
front of me
 
02:30:12.650 --> 02:30:12.660 align:start position:0%
um one of the disadvantages of zoom and
 
02:30:15.170 --> 02:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
not getting copies of bills
 
02:30:21.530 --> 02:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:24.110 --> 02:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
um where it where we are talking
 
02:30:27.530 --> 02:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
difference is that there are decals for
 
02:30:27.540 --> 02:30:29.389 align:start position:0%
difference is that there are decals for
various

02:30:29.389 --> 02:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
various
 
02:30:29.399 --> 02:30:30.710 align:start position:0%
various
um

02:30:30.710 --> 02:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:33.290 --> 02:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
affiliations with for example the army
 
02:30:37.070 --> 02:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
or the Marine Corps what it is if you
 
02:30:40.490 --> 02:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
look in the Bold part in section Roman 3
 
02:30:43.250 --> 02:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
the division of Veterans Services shall
 
02:30:46.610 --> 02:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
provide Gold Star Family decals to those
 
02:30:49.870 --> 02:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
who qualify under the RSA free of charge
 
02:30:54.050 --> 02:30:54.060 align:start position:0%
that is the change to the existing law
 
02:30:57.530 --> 02:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:03.469 --> 02:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:05.330 --> 02:31:05.340 align:start position:0%

Graham
 
02:31:11.090 --> 02:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
um do you happen to know how long
 
02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
um Gold Star Family decals have um been
 
02:31:14.040 --> 02:31:16.309 align:start position:0%
um Gold Star Family decals have um been
allowed

02:31:16.309 --> 02:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
um it's been a couple of years I think
 
02:31:20.270 --> 02:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
the department will be able to testify
 
02:31:23.030 --> 02:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
that I do know that they bought a roll
 
02:31:27.230 --> 02:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
of decals in 2019 and still have most of
 
02:31:29.650 --> 02:31:29.660 align:start position:0%
them left
 
02:31:46.030 --> 02:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:52.490 --> 02:31:52.500 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative Graham
 
02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
it am I missing where it specifies
 
02:32:05.570 --> 02:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
who actually qualifies
 
02:32:08.510 --> 02:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
um is it a parent is it a a widow is it
 
02:32:10.010 --> 02:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
a discipline
 
02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
it is specified in the RSA and I do not
 
02:32:14.710 --> 02:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
02:32:17.690 --> 02:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
memorizing that RSA nor do I have it in
 
02:32:19.370 --> 02:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
front of me but if you look under the
 
02:32:22.730 --> 02:32:22.740 align:start position:0%
RSA it specifies who gold star families
 
02:32:34.429 --> 02:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:38.750 --> 02:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:41.090 --> 02:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
uh representative Graham thank you for
 
02:32:42.650 --> 02:32:42.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:32:42.660 --> 02:32:43.309 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:32:43.309 --> 02:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:45.650 --> 02:32:45.660 align:start position:0%
would you have any idea or is this a
 
02:32:47.150 --> 02:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
better question for the people coming
 
02:32:48.830 --> 02:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
after you
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
um do we have ideas of total numbers of
 
02:32:55.309 --> 02:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
gold star applicants that could result
 
02:32:57.710 --> 02:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
from this
 
02:33:01.969 --> 02:33:01.979 align:start position:0%
um I do not they may but not all gold
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
star family members want to
 
02:33:09.469 --> 02:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
place those decals on their their
 
02:33:11.990 --> 02:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
license plate only because of the grief
 
02:33:14.270 --> 02:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
that they still feel
 
02:33:16.910 --> 02:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
um so I there's no way that I can answer
 
02:33:19.370 --> 02:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
that nor do I think the department will
 
02:33:22.309 --> 02:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
they may have a total number
 
02:33:25.849 --> 02:33:25.859 align:start position:0%
um but if we go back far enough it's a
 
02:33:28.610 --> 02:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
larger number but it's still in my
 
02:33:31.849 --> 02:33:31.859 align:start position:0%
opinion worth the
 
02:33:35.630 --> 02:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
um States in essence subsidizing these
 
02:33:38.450 --> 02:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
decals for those family members who do
 
02:33:40.090 --> 02:33:40.100 align:start position:0%
wish to to
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:46.730 --> 02:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for your response and thank
 
02:33:51.730 --> 02:33:51.740 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:34:21.110 --> 02:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
I have that in front of me it's
 
02:34:23.510 --> 02:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's a rather long list but it says
 
02:34:26.210 --> 02:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
family members would include spouse
 
02:34:28.250 --> 02:34:28.260 align:start position:0%

previous and previous work that we had
 
02:34:50.830 --> 02:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
done and it's under
 
02:34:55.490 --> 02:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
261-c colon 3 Dash small a
 
02:34:57.790 --> 02:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
if that's helpful
 
02:35:00.170 --> 02:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
I was in the cooking process of looking
 
02:35:01.610 --> 02:35:01.620 align:start position:0%
it up myself thinking representative
 
02:35:04.969 --> 02:35:04.979 align:start position:0%
sites in terms of answering the question

veteran community and those groups are
 
02:36:41.570 --> 02:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
our names that would be familiar to you
 
02:36:43.550 --> 02:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
for our new members things like the
 
02:36:45.290 --> 02:36:45.300 align:start position:0%

groups are represented here and one of
 
02:36:56.270 --> 02:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
the things we do is we look at all the
 
02:36:58.190 --> 02:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
bills that are coming out
 
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
and we take a position in favor of or
 
02:37:03.349 --> 02:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
against them and then they send me
 
02:37:05.570 --> 02:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
normally to see you folks in person and
 
02:37:06.889 --> 02:37:06.899 align:start position:0%
I look forward to being able to do that
 
02:37:09.889 --> 02:37:09.899 align:start position:0%
at some point uh but at least to testify
 
02:37:11.990 --> 02:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
and let you know uh how we're thinking
 
02:37:15.469 --> 02:37:15.479 align:start position:0%
on this to just clarify this the the the
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
actual a very very brief history lesson
 
02:37:23.090 --> 02:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
we understand as veterans how difficult
 
02:37:25.490 --> 02:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
the system is with with respect to
 
02:37:28.010 --> 02:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
license plates I know Massachusetts has
 
02:37:29.630 --> 02:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
a group of license plates and every time
 
02:37:31.429 --> 02:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
somebody sees a Massachusetts license
 
02:37:33.950 --> 02:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
plate that that appeals to their
 
02:37:35.870 --> 02:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
particular demographic they're coming in
 
02:37:37.790 --> 02:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
front of your committee looking to try
 
02:37:39.770 --> 02:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
and get a plate that says this and we
 
02:37:41.929 --> 02:37:41.939 align:start position:0%
know how expensive that those are so
 
02:37:43.610 --> 02:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
about five or six years ago we came up
 
02:37:45.590 --> 02:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
with this idea of a of a kind of a
 
02:37:46.730 --> 02:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
standard plate that you could put a
 
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
decal on and and we have taken as our
 
02:37:51.530 --> 02:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
position in the in the state veterans
 
02:37:53.750 --> 02:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
advisory committee uh for if you want a
 
02:37:56.030 --> 02:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
a decal that says when I was in the Air
 
02:37:57.469 --> 02:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
Force I got an Air Force accommodation
 
02:37:59.150 --> 02:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
medal you can have that but it's going
 
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
to be a sticker okay it's not going to
 
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
be a full-fledged license plate
 
02:38:07.429 --> 02:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
um this the the the the the bill two
 
02:38:09.590 --> 02:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
years ago that established this was HB
 
02:38:12.370 --> 02:38:12.380 align:start position:0%
549 and it's in RSA
 
02:38:14.929 --> 02:38:14.939 align:start position:0%
261c for those of you that might want to
 
02:38:17.150 --> 02:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
go and and look up the eligibility and
 
02:38:19.730 --> 02:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
all that it was out of the 2019 uh
 
02:38:22.250 --> 02:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
session we as a state veterans advisory
 
02:38:24.530 --> 02:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
committee met on this last January in
 
02:38:26.270 --> 02:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
January earlier this month and we
 
02:38:28.550 --> 02:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
unanimously support this bill we
 
02:38:30.349 --> 02:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
02:38:32.809 --> 02:38:32.819 align:start position:0%
um you know that when when one of us
 
02:38:36.290 --> 02:38:36.300 align:start position:0%
serves as a as as a military person the
 
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
whole family serves and the the more
 
02:38:42.349 --> 02:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
visibility that we get of the sacrifices
 
02:38:43.969 --> 02:38:43.979 align:start position:0%
that are made not just by our service
 
02:38:46.429 --> 02:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
members but by their families uh who are
 
02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
left back home even for the ones that
 
02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
return uh the more the more we like that
 
02:38:54.050 --> 02:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
so we unanimously support this and with
 
02:38:55.730 --> 02:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
that uh I have any questions I will
 
02:38:58.010 --> 02:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
leave you with the idea that if you are
 
02:39:00.590 --> 02:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
thinking of introducing a bill that has
 
02:39:03.110 --> 02:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
veteran impact we invite you to come and
 
02:39:05.330 --> 02:39:05.340 align:start position:0%

deputy adjutant general for New
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Department of military
 
02:39:57.290 --> 02:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
Affairs and Veterans Services our
 
02:40:00.170 --> 02:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
division of veteran services uh manages
 
02:40:03.290 --> 02:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
the decal program uh for veterans plates
 
02:40:04.929 --> 02:40:04.939 align:start position:0%
and Veterans decals
 
02:40:08.630 --> 02:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh we uh we are very much in favor of uh
 
02:40:11.450 --> 02:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
this bill uh it is uh not cost
 
02:40:13.790 --> 02:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
prohibitive at all the stickers cost
 
02:40:16.010 --> 02:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
about two dollars a piece
 
02:40:18.050 --> 02:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
and we're able to absorb that cost with
 
02:40:20.090 --> 02:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
the sale of the other decals that
 
02:40:23.030 --> 02:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative Graham mentioned you know
 
02:40:25.849 --> 02:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
based on service and for Medals of Valor
 
02:40:29.450 --> 02:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
uh right now uh I will tell you that we
 
02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
have sold to confirm what Mr
 
02:40:32.809 --> 02:40:32.819 align:start position:0%
representative Graham said we have sold
 
02:40:38.210 --> 02:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
uh since 2019 uh nine sets of decals
 
02:40:40.790 --> 02:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
most recently to Captain phaneuf's
 
02:40:42.830 --> 02:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
family uh some of you may remember that
 
02:40:44.990 --> 02:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
Captain phano tragically died in a
 
02:40:49.010 --> 02:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
airplane crash in Afghanistan uh
 
02:40:52.670 --> 02:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh about a year ago so this what this
 
02:40:54.770 --> 02:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
program does is just it just allows us
 
02:40:57.290 --> 02:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
to give the decals instead of charging a
 
02:41:00.349 --> 02:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
this menial 10 fee to families who have
 
02:41:02.510 --> 02:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
lost a loved one in the defense of our
 
02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:03.349 align:start position:0%
lost a loved one in the defense of our
nation

02:41:03.349 --> 02:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
nation
 
02:41:05.389 --> 02:41:05.399 align:start position:0%

02:41:09.490 --> 02:41:09.500 align:start position:0%
have I will uh I will yield to questions

up this week
 
02:41:30.889 --> 02:41:30.899 align:start position:0%
I'll put it out to the public in case
 
02:41:33.110 --> 02:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
there's any late new people joining but
 
02:41:34.370 --> 02:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else that we should
 
02:41:36.710 --> 02:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill
 
02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill
foreign

02:41:48.900 --> 02:41:48.910 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:48.910 --> 02:42:21.469 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:42:21.469 --> 02:42:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:21.479 --> 02:42:22.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:42:22.670 --> 02:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:25.130 --> 02:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
in terms of the blue sheet there was
 
02:42:27.590 --> 02:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
only one other person that signed up for
 
02:42:29.870 --> 02:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
this bill heard his name into the last
 
02:42:32.150 --> 02:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
couple Eric Rathburn member of the
 
02:42:34.670 --> 02:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
public uh Annie is in support of this
 
02:42:36.790 --> 02:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
particular event so
 
02:42:39.530 --> 02:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
with that being said
 
02:42:39.540 --> 02:42:40.250 align:start position:0%
with that being said
um

02:42:40.250 --> 02:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:43.570 --> 02:42:43.580 align:start position:0%
does anybody else has anything on this
 
02:42:45.950 --> 02:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
let me give you a before I close it
 
02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:47.570 align:start position:0%
let me give you a before I close it
completely

02:42:47.570 --> 02:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
completely
 
02:42:49.250 --> 02:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
02:42:51.889 --> 02:42:51.899 align:start position:0%
and I think George could probably attest
 
02:42:53.809 --> 02:42:53.819 align:start position:0%
to this we did the best we're not going
 
02:42:54.950 --> 02:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
to do the best they can to schedule
 
02:42:57.349 --> 02:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate times for these hearings it
 
02:43:00.490 --> 02:43:00.500 align:start position:0%
seems like uh you can never win on them
 
02:43:04.250 --> 02:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
originally I looked at maybe doing some
 
02:43:06.770 --> 02:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
executive sessions uh that's why I
 
02:43:08.090 --> 02:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
didn't shorten up the first couple of
 
02:43:10.250 --> 02:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
bills I figured those would be short
 
02:43:12.230 --> 02:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
and I've also left a little bit of time
 
02:43:14.870 --> 02:43:14.880 align:start position:0%

02:43:18.469 --> 02:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
the reason
 
02:43:18.479 --> 02:43:20.110 align:start position:0%
the reason

um
 
02:43:23.270 --> 02:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
being that the health clerk everybody
 
02:43:25.070 --> 02:43:25.080 align:start position:0%

documents I sent out a few emails just
 
04:02:40.790 --> 04:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
keeping the committee apprised and now
 
04:02:42.229 --> 04:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
I'm finding out some aren't getting it
 
04:02:44.510 --> 04:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
and I've been using the uh the link
 
04:02:46.189 --> 04:02:46.199 align:start position:0%
through the general court so I want to
 
04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
talk to the point for me to get that
 
04:02:49.910 --> 04:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
fixed yeah
 
04:02:49.920 --> 04:02:51.290 align:start position:0%

04:02:51.300 --> 04:02:53.950 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

04:02:53.950 --> 04:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:02:55.910 --> 04:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
has everybody else been getting the
 
04:02:58.250 --> 04:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
emails yeah
 
04:02:59.769 --> 04:02:59.779 align:start position:0%
yeah I have not
 
04:03:06.690 --> 04:03:06.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:06.700 --> 04:03:08.450 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:03:08.450 --> 04:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:03:08.460 --> 04:03:18.490 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:03:18.490 --> 04:03:18.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
I'll make sure everybody receives that
 
04:03:25.370 --> 04:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:32.030 --> 04:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:38.210 --> 04:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:41.330 --> 04:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
and put it into my clerk step here so
 
04:03:44.750 --> 04:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
but I think those people who said
 
04:03:47.150 --> 04:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
another reason possibly could be whether
 
04:03:49.490 --> 04:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
or not it's on the legislative email or
 
04:03:52.010 --> 04:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
if using personals anyway I'm not
 
04:03:54.110 --> 04:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
recognize we've got an issue let me get
 
04:03:56.689 --> 04:03:56.699 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of it we're not going to
 
04:03:59.269 --> 04:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
um exactly anything today anyway so I'll
 
04:04:00.590 --> 04:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
make sure you get the information before
 
04:04:03.290 --> 04:04:03.300 align:start position:0%
that happens next week okay
 
04:04:06.189 --> 04:04:06.199 align:start position:0%
but that being said let's get to
 
04:04:09.170 --> 04:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
representative Lander
 
04:04:17.630 --> 04:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:19.849 --> 04:04:19.859 align:start position:0%

you taking my time and I apologize I did
 
04:04:29.570 --> 04:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
receive an email through my legislative
 
04:04:31.490 --> 04:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
email that says it got postponed until
 
04:04:33.229 --> 04:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
next week so I apologize for the
 
04:04:33.239 --> 04:04:34.309 align:start position:0%
next week so I apologize for the
confusion

04:04:34.309 --> 04:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
04:04:36.170 --> 04:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony today
 
04:04:39.349 --> 04:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
on this bill today I come before you
 
04:04:41.710 --> 04:04:41.720 align:start position:0%
sort of through Zoom
 
04:04:46.389 --> 04:04:46.399 align:start position:0%
in regards to my house bill relative to
 
04:04:50.469 --> 04:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
municipally elected decal plates
 
04:04:50.479 --> 04:04:52.010 align:start position:0%
municipally elected decal plates
so

04:04:52.010 --> 04:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:04:53.870 --> 04:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
everybody loves their plates here in New
 
04:04:53.880 --> 04:04:55.309 align:start position:0%
everybody loves their plates here in New
Hampshire

04:04:55.309 --> 04:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:04:58.510 --> 04:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately we don't have plates
 
04:05:01.309 --> 04:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
like other states but one of the many
 
04:05:03.650 --> 04:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
benefits that we do have are the decal
 
04:05:05.090 --> 04:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
plates which I think are an excellent
 
04:05:07.250 --> 04:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
addition to our state it brings in
 
04:05:10.370 --> 04:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
additional revenue and it brings in
 
04:05:11.929 --> 04:05:11.939 align:start position:0%
um well that's it I mean it just brings
 
04:05:16.389 --> 04:05:16.399 align:start position:0%
in additional Revenue so HB 20 222
 
04:05:18.889 --> 04:05:18.899 align:start position:0%
is specific to municipally elected
 
04:05:20.950 --> 04:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
leaders in our communities
 
04:05:24.969 --> 04:05:24.979 align:start position:0%
it gives them a decale no I have not
 
04:05:26.870 --> 04:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
spoken with the Department of
 
04:05:28.670 --> 04:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation on this matter yet and I
 
04:05:30.830 --> 04:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
do apologize I was planning on doing
 
04:05:33.590 --> 04:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
that today once I realized uh that the
 
04:05:35.330 --> 04:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
committee had what it looked like the
 
04:05:37.729 --> 04:05:37.739 align:start position:0%
committee had postponed but did not
 
04:05:37.739 --> 04:05:38.389 align:start position:0%
committee had postponed but did not
um

04:05:38.389 --> 04:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:38.399 --> 04:05:39.769 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:05:39.769 --> 04:05:39.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:05:41.990 --> 04:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
um it just forgives our Municipal
 
04:05:44.269 --> 04:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
Municipal budget committees uh Selectmen
 
04:05:46.070 --> 04:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
school boards and opportunity school
 
04:05:48.550 --> 04:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
board members excuse me an opportunity
 
04:05:51.530 --> 04:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
to have a detailed plate and a vanity
 
04:05:54.110 --> 04:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
plate and
 
04:05:59.870 --> 04:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:01.070 --> 04:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
um actually I've got a couple on this
 
04:06:01.080 --> 04:06:04.910 align:start position:0%
um actually I've got a couple on this
one

04:06:04.910 --> 04:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:06.050 --> 04:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
we needed by some of the new members
 
04:06:08.809 --> 04:06:08.819 align:start position:0%
know where this
 
04:06:10.630 --> 04:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
came to be
 
04:06:12.950 --> 04:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
two turns back
 
04:06:16.070 --> 04:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
already for a couple of years before we
 
04:06:20.170 --> 04:06:20.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:23.150 --> 04:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
because for years maybe even decades
 
04:06:25.250 --> 04:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
you're right people around the state
 
04:06:26.870 --> 04:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
wanted some personalization on their
 
04:06:28.309 --> 04:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
license plates
 
04:06:30.229 --> 04:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
and every time we got a bill to propose
 
04:06:33.110 --> 04:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
any specific license plate we had to say
 
04:06:36.010 --> 04:06:36.020 align:start position:0%
no because of the sheer numbers
 
04:06:39.410 --> 04:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of dollars
 
04:06:42.710 --> 04:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
so this was a solution and for the most
 
04:06:45.530 --> 04:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
part if you look into your RSA which is
 
04:06:48.010 --> 04:06:48.020 align:start position:0%
261 B3
 
04:06:50.030 --> 04:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
we'll see that
 
04:06:53.570 --> 04:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
the full intent of this beginning was to
 
04:06:57.110 --> 04:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
give legitimate non-profit organizations
 
04:07:00.110 --> 04:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
the ability to get this decal plate if
 
04:07:02.570 --> 04:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
you go through the DNB or a small fee it
 
04:07:04.490 --> 04:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
has the real estate or an approved
 
04:07:07.429 --> 04:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
sticker or decal provided by that
 
04:07:07.439 --> 04:07:10.610 align:start position:0%
sticker or decal provided by that
organization

04:07:10.610 --> 04:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:12.650 --> 04:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
the exception that I can find a statute
 
04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
to that
 
04:07:13.680 --> 04:07:15.950 align:start position:0%
to that
is

04:07:15.950 --> 04:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:07:17.710 --> 04:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
the fire department
 
04:07:21.110 --> 04:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
which if you look
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
and I have a way to answer my question
 
04:07:22.800 --> 04:07:23.809 align:start position:0%
and I have a way to answer my question
sir

04:07:23.809 --> 04:07:23.819 align:start position:0%
sir
 
04:07:23.819 --> 04:07:24.650 align:start position:0%
sir
um

04:07:24.650 --> 04:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:26.870 --> 04:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
except for decals issue by the city of
 
04:07:29.689 --> 04:07:29.699 align:start position:0%
town Financial to Firefighters and
 
04:07:31.849 --> 04:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
retired firefighters decals shovel
 
04:07:34.130 --> 04:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
distributed by organizations authorized
 
04:07:35.929 --> 04:07:35.939 align:start position:0%
by Statute so in other words what I'm
 
04:07:37.630 --> 04:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
saying is that the only exception to
 
04:07:40.790 --> 04:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
this chapter is the firefighters and
 
04:07:43.370 --> 04:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
many specifically having method of
 
04:07:45.710 --> 04:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
getting the stickers with decals which
 
04:07:47.630 --> 04:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
is from the fire chief to the
 
04:07:47.640 --> 04:07:48.830 align:start position:0%
is from the fire chief to the
firefighters

04:07:48.830 --> 04:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
firefighters
 
04:07:51.170 --> 04:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
and it is their universal symbol which
 
04:07:52.849 --> 04:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
never goes away
 
04:07:55.309 --> 04:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
so my first question on this
 
04:07:55.319 --> 04:07:57.110 align:start position:0%
so my first question on this
is

04:07:57.110 --> 04:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:08:00.469 --> 04:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
to see something missing here if this
 
04:08:02.630 --> 04:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
would have been passed the way it is who
 
04:08:04.370 --> 04:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
in the municipality is going to be
 
04:08:07.070 --> 04:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
authorized to combine these decals and
 
04:08:10.689 --> 04:08:10.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:12.710 --> 04:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for your
 
04:08:14.630 --> 04:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate it um that's a
 
04:08:16.309 --> 04:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
really good question so
 
04:08:19.070 --> 04:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
um for myself when I was a former UNH
 
04:08:23.030 --> 04:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
student I had obtained a decal and
 
04:08:25.250 --> 04:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
um I obtained that detail
 
04:08:28.550 --> 04:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
um by uh
 
04:08:32.389 --> 04:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
the excuse me the town clerk's office
 
04:08:35.210 --> 04:08:35.220 align:start position:0%
um I filed some paperwork the town clerk
 
04:08:38.090 --> 04:08:38.100 align:start position:0%
would then send me send the information
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
and UNH would then send that detail to
 
04:08:41.640 --> 04:08:43.610 align:start position:0%
and UNH would then send that detail to
me

04:08:43.610 --> 04:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:08:43.620 --> 04:08:45.530 align:start position:0%
me
um

04:08:45.530 --> 04:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:47.570 --> 04:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
uh at a later date and then I would also
 
04:08:50.210 --> 04:08:50.220 align:start position:0%
receive the vanity plate as well
 
04:08:52.309 --> 04:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:08:55.910 --> 04:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
while you bring about valid question I
 
04:08:57.710 --> 04:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
assumed that it would be the town clerk
 
04:08:59.389 --> 04:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
that would provide that decal plate just
 
04:09:03.410 --> 04:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
as that town clerk also provides that
 
04:09:03.420 --> 04:09:04.670 align:start position:0%
as that town clerk also provides that
um

04:09:04.670 --> 04:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:07.010 --> 04:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
that vanity plate that's exactly what
 
04:09:08.990 --> 04:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
this is this is a vanity plate
 
04:09:09.000 --> 04:09:10.250 align:start position:0%
this is this is a vanity plate
um

04:09:10.250 --> 04:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
I believe I answered your question
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes I'm actually surprised that
 
04:09:18.110 --> 04:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:20.990 --> 04:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
probably certain sort of deals
 
04:09:23.210 --> 04:09:23.220 align:start position:0%
um okay so I'll leave that one load at
 
04:09:26.210 --> 04:09:26.220 align:start position:0%
this point my next question would be
 
04:09:26.220 --> 04:09:27.429 align:start position:0%
this point my next question would be
um

04:09:27.429 --> 04:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:30.530 --> 04:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
Rich officers of the municipalities
 
04:09:32.809 --> 04:09:32.819 align:start position:0%
what's considered an officer let's give
 
04:09:34.670 --> 04:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
you an example I mean I can assume that
 
04:09:37.250 --> 04:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
the elected uh chair of a select board
 
04:09:41.929 --> 04:09:41.939 align:start position:0%
for example is an officer but my town
 
04:09:43.849 --> 04:09:43.859 align:start position:0%
um Vice chair um
 
04:09:46.130 --> 04:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
planning but that's an appointed
 
04:09:48.889 --> 04:09:48.899 align:start position:0%
position would that be considered an
 
04:09:48.899 --> 04:09:49.990 align:start position:0%
position would that be considered an
officer

04:09:49.990 --> 04:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
officer
 
04:09:52.429 --> 04:09:52.439 align:start position:0%
well what do you think
 
04:09:53.870 --> 04:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
so this is supposed to be for
 
04:09:56.229 --> 04:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
municipally elected officials
 
04:09:59.929 --> 04:09:59.939 align:start position:0%
so it obtains so it applies to all
 
04:10:02.570 --> 04:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
municipally elected officials
 
04:10:02.580 --> 04:10:03.849 align:start position:0%
municipally elected officials
um

04:10:03.849 --> 04:10:03.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:06.410 --> 04:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
the the question of officers over
 
04:10:08.870 --> 04:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
officials would be a question that I
 
04:10:10.490 --> 04:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
would need to ask OLS and I'd be happy
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
to make that Amendment if it's necessary
 
04:10:16.910 --> 04:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
um but it it is and it is meant to be
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
for municipally elected officials
 
04:10:21.229 --> 04:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
um and that applies to all members of
 
04:10:22.969 --> 04:10:22.979 align:start position:0%
the budget committee all members of the
 
04:10:24.830 --> 04:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
board of Selectmen all members of the
 
04:10:27.170 --> 04:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
school board planning board provide
 
04:10:30.769 --> 04:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
provide upon showing of proof of office
 
04:10:34.010 --> 04:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
um so you obviously receive you you do
 
04:10:37.429 --> 04:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
have taken oath upon taking office I did
 
04:10:39.469 --> 04:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
when I became a selectman
 
04:10:41.090 --> 04:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
um as we all did when we all became
 
04:10:43.429 --> 04:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
state representatives uh that is your
 
04:10:45.110 --> 04:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
proof your oath of office you provide
 
04:10:47.689 --> 04:10:47.699 align:start position:0%
that proof you attend that detail for
 
04:10:48.889 --> 04:10:48.899 align:start position:0%
your plate
 
04:10:51.530 --> 04:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
and it's a generic municipally elected
 
04:10:51.540 --> 04:10:53.450 align:start position:0%
and it's a generic municipally elected
decal

04:10:53.450 --> 04:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
decal
 
04:10:55.790 --> 04:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
um not you know you don't there's not
 
04:10:57.410 --> 04:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
one for Budget committee there's not one
 
04:10:58.849 --> 04:10:58.859 align:start position:0%
for selectman there's not one for school
 
04:11:00.229 --> 04:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
board it's just one generic for
 
04:11:02.090 --> 04:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
municipally elected official
 
04:11:03.950 --> 04:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
okay that was another question so you
 
04:11:06.410 --> 04:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
see me there
 
04:11:08.929 --> 04:11:08.939 align:start position:0%
um finally my last question would be on
 
04:11:08.939 --> 04:11:10.969 align:start position:0%
um finally my last question would be on
it

04:11:10.969 --> 04:11:10.979 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:11:14.570 --> 04:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
what would happen once uh
 
04:11:14.580 --> 04:11:16.250 align:start position:0%
what would happen once uh
officer

04:11:16.250 --> 04:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
officer
 
04:11:18.290 --> 04:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
who's no longer an officer what happens
 
04:11:20.450 --> 04:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
to that decaf
 
04:11:22.849 --> 04:11:22.859 align:start position:0%
but the ability to have that detail on
 
04:11:23.870 --> 04:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
the plate
 
04:11:26.530 --> 04:11:26.540 align:start position:0%
no I should just because
 
04:11:28.490 --> 04:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
you can assume a lot of things but
 
04:11:30.530 --> 04:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
unless it's freaking announcements I'm
 
04:11:32.050 --> 04:11:32.060 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
04:11:35.210 --> 04:11:35.220 align:start position:0%
what to do
 
04:11:36.830 --> 04:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
no I mean that's a valid point
 
04:11:39.790 --> 04:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
representative and thank you um
 
04:11:43.969 --> 04:11:43.979 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate it that you know again an
 
04:11:46.070 --> 04:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that I'd be happy to make
 
04:11:46.080 --> 04:11:47.990 align:start position:0%
amendment that I'd be happy to make
um

04:11:47.990 --> 04:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:48.000 --> 04:11:49.429 align:start position:0%
um
absolutely

04:11:49.429 --> 04:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
04:11:51.469 --> 04:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
all right I'm just again I'm just asking
 
04:11:54.889 --> 04:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
questions to say the decal plate though
 
04:11:56.450 --> 04:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
is not always that simple especially
 
04:11:56.460 --> 04:11:59.530 align:start position:0%
is not always that simple especially
form

04:11:59.530 --> 04:11:59.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:03.229 --> 04:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
101 the organizations
 
04:12:05.929 --> 04:12:05.939 align:start position:0%
does change in a pretty good-sized way
 
04:12:07.990 --> 04:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
the intent of the program to begin with
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
so done with me any other questions from
 
04:12:14.330 --> 04:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
the committee okay I see several
 
04:12:14.340 --> 04:12:17.750 align:start position:0%
the committee okay I see several
representative

04:12:17.750 --> 04:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thank you
 
04:12:22.550 --> 04:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative Belanger for your your
 
04:12:24.950 --> 04:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
your bill here question I have if I'm
 
04:12:27.769 --> 04:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
reading this correctly are the decals at
 
04:12:29.570 --> 04:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
no charge
 
04:12:29.580 --> 04:12:32.990 align:start position:0%
no charge
oh

04:12:32.990 --> 04:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:35.030 --> 04:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh no representative Gorski that is not
 
04:12:38.990 --> 04:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
the intent um it is uh supposed to be uh
 
04:12:42.650 --> 04:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
paid for of a set amount I Believe by
 
04:12:42.660 --> 04:12:44.210 align:start position:0%
paid for of a set amount I Believe by
Dot

04:12:44.210 --> 04:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
Dot
 
04:12:45.889 --> 04:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
I would have to get back to you on that
 
04:12:47.570 --> 04:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
and I do apologize
 
04:12:49.969 --> 04:12:49.979 align:start position:0%
um but uh you know for your typical
 
04:12:53.090 --> 04:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
decal plate say for the ones from UNH
 
04:12:57.410 --> 04:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
um I paid 15 or 25 and
 
04:12:59.570 --> 04:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
um that went to the UNH Foundation
 
04:13:03.050 --> 04:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
however that would be so the the reason
 
04:13:05.689 --> 04:13:05.699 align:start position:0%
why this has a fiscal note is my
 
04:13:07.910 --> 04:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is because it will cost
 
04:13:09.830 --> 04:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
but it actually brings in more Revenue
 
04:13:09.840 --> 04:13:11.090 align:start position:0%
but it actually brings in more Revenue
so

04:13:11.090 --> 04:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:13:11.100 --> 04:13:12.290 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:13:12.290 --> 04:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:14.689 --> 04:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
no it is not going to be free of charge
 
04:13:16.670 --> 04:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
you do have to it you do pay for the
 
04:13:18.830 --> 04:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
vanity plate and then you would also uh
 
04:13:20.689 --> 04:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
pay for the decal as well
 
04:13:23.570 --> 04:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
04:13:23.580 --> 04:13:27.650 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
representative

04:13:27.650 --> 04:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:29.090 --> 04:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:13:31.010 --> 04:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:13:33.530 --> 04:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:13:37.670 --> 04:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
first I would ask you to specify where
 
04:13:40.429 --> 04:13:40.439 align:start position:0%
would the profits of this program go
 
04:13:42.290 --> 04:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
04:13:46.429 --> 04:13:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:48.889 --> 04:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
so my intent is for the funds to go into
 
04:13:51.050 --> 04:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
04:13:54.410 --> 04:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
okay thank you follow up
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:13:58.969 --> 04:13:58.979 align:start position:0%
um the other problem I see though is
 
04:14:01.550 --> 04:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
that this is listed in the specific
 
04:14:01.560 --> 04:14:03.290 align:start position:0%
that this is listed in the specific
section

04:14:03.290 --> 04:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:14:05.290 --> 04:14:05.300 align:start position:0%
um RSA
 
04:14:10.030 --> 04:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
261-b colon 9 which lists the
 
04:14:12.830 --> 04:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
non-profit organizations that are
 
04:14:14.809 --> 04:14:14.819 align:start position:0%
approved for this program
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't actually think if this was an
 
04:14:19.729 --> 04:14:19.739 align:start position:0%
approved use of the decal program it
 
04:14:21.889 --> 04:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
should go here in this section of
 
04:14:21.899 --> 04:14:23.510 align:start position:0%
should go here in this section of
non-profits

04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
non-profits
 
04:14:23.520 --> 04:14:24.769 align:start position:0%
non-profits
um

04:14:24.769 --> 04:14:24.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:28.910 --> 04:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
could you suggest where else it could go
 
04:14:31.729 --> 04:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
or have you looked at this section any
 
04:14:31.739 --> 04:14:32.990 align:start position:0%
or have you looked at this section any
closer

04:14:32.990 --> 04:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
closer
 
04:14:36.229 --> 04:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:38.389 --> 04:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh representative thank you I
 
04:14:41.389 --> 04:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate your question um so when OLS
 
04:14:44.150 --> 04:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
had given me the decal plate
 
04:14:46.490 --> 04:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
um excuse me the decal plate
 
04:14:50.269 --> 04:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
uh bill I did research the bill
 
04:14:52.570 --> 04:14:52.580 align:start position:0%
previously I thought it was sufficient
 
04:14:55.010 --> 04:14:55.020 align:start position:0%
but again being a new representative I'm
 
04:14:56.630 --> 04:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
not trying to say that that's my excuse
 
04:14:56.640 --> 04:14:57.889 align:start position:0%
not trying to say that that's my excuse
but

04:14:57.889 --> 04:14:57.899 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:14:57.899 --> 04:14:58.849 align:start position:0%
but
um

04:14:58.849 --> 04:14:58.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:02.150 --> 04:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know you get lost in in
 
04:15:04.370 --> 04:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
the legal mumbo jumbo so I do apologize
 
04:15:08.870 --> 04:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:12.050 --> 04:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
I I understand that in 261 colon excuse
 
04:15:14.210 --> 04:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
me 261-b colon 3 authorized
 
04:15:14.220 --> 04:15:15.830 align:start position:0%
me 261-b colon 3 authorized
organizations

04:15:15.830 --> 04:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
04:15:15.840 --> 04:15:17.929 align:start position:0%
organizations
it

04:15:17.929 --> 04:15:17.939 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:15:20.630 --> 04:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
it it seems vague doesn't seem specific
 
04:15:23.809 --> 04:15:23.819 align:start position:0%
I guess you could create a different
 
04:15:23.819 --> 04:15:25.250 align:start position:0%
I guess you could create a different
section

04:15:25.250 --> 04:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:15:26.750 --> 04:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
um say
 
04:15:31.130 --> 04:15:31.140 align:start position:0%
there's uh 261-b colon 3-c uh you could
 
04:15:34.010 --> 04:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
do Dash D if you will
 
04:15:34.020 --> 04:15:35.750 align:start position:0%
do Dash D if you will
um

04:15:35.750 --> 04:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:35.760 --> 04:15:37.429 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

04:15:37.429 --> 04:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:15:39.710 --> 04:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
that answers my question I just wanted
 
04:15:41.330 --> 04:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
to point out that it's not technically a
 
04:15:42.889 --> 04:15:42.899 align:start position:0%
non-profit so I believe that if we keep
 
04:15:44.689 --> 04:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
it as it is in the wrong section but
 
04:15:47.210 --> 04:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
that answers my question thank you
 
04:15:49.189 --> 04:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:15:49.199 --> 04:15:52.429 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
representative

04:15:52.429 --> 04:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:55.189 --> 04:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I hope you can
 
04:15:57.110 --> 04:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
hear me can you hear me all right
 
04:15:58.670 --> 04:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am I can
 
04:16:00.889 --> 04:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
thank you uh and thank you for taking my
 
04:16:00.899 --> 04:16:02.510 align:start position:0%
thank you uh and thank you for taking my
question

04:16:02.510 --> 04:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:16:05.210 --> 04:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
um normally we have
 
04:16:09.410 --> 04:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
um elections for these officials around
 
04:16:13.790 --> 04:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
town meeting day and if the elected
 
04:16:15.950 --> 04:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
official is either not re-elected or
 
04:16:17.809 --> 04:16:17.819 align:start position:0%
doesn't choose to run again what happens
 
04:16:20.929 --> 04:16:20.939 align:start position:0%
with the decal are they require to take
 
04:16:23.990 --> 04:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
them off or return them or what do you
 
04:16:25.969 --> 04:16:25.979 align:start position:0%
want to do with that
 
04:16:28.070 --> 04:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
so as I stated to the first gentleman's
 
04:16:30.469 --> 04:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
question representative Aaron thank you
 
04:16:34.189 --> 04:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
um the the once the officer has no
 
04:16:36.530 --> 04:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
longer continued that office they would
 
04:16:38.450 --> 04:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
be required to
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
um no longer be allowed to hold that
 
04:16:42.950 --> 04:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
decal as they no longer are an elected
 
04:16:44.689 --> 04:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
official and again an amendment that
 
04:16:46.910 --> 04:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
would need to be made
 
04:16:49.130 --> 04:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much
 
04:16:54.490 --> 04:16:54.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:57.530 --> 04:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:16:59.809 --> 04:16:59.819 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
04:17:02.990 --> 04:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
um representative Aaron I I think stole
 
04:17:04.849 --> 04:17:04.859 align:start position:0%
some of my thunder there
 
04:17:06.830 --> 04:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
um so it is not your expectation that
 
04:17:09.469 --> 04:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
these are lifetime
 
04:17:13.370 --> 04:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
stickers that uh no that if if you had
 
04:17:17.389 --> 04:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
been a selectman ever you could uh you
 
04:17:19.849 --> 04:17:19.859 align:start position:0%
could maintain that uh that status on
 
04:17:22.309 --> 04:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
your license plate
 
04:17:24.349 --> 04:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
no this would be strictly for those who
 
04:17:26.510 --> 04:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
are elected to office once you have been
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
removed from office whether it be you
 
04:17:31.849 --> 04:17:31.859 align:start position:0%
resign uh you've been removed via Vote
 
04:17:34.610 --> 04:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
or you choose not to run you would no
 
04:17:37.550 --> 04:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
longer be allowed to hold that plate
 
04:17:39.530 --> 04:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
you could hold the vanity plate if you
 
04:17:41.090 --> 04:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
wanted to but you would not be able to
 
04:17:43.250 --> 04:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
have the detail itself
 
04:17:48.650 --> 04:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:52.309 --> 04:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
um my my follow-up would be
 
04:17:54.290 --> 04:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
um have you considered how it would work
 
04:17:54.300 --> 04:17:56.090 align:start position:0%
um have you considered how it would work
with

04:17:56.090 --> 04:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:17:59.090 --> 04:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
um groups like uh Cooperative school
 
04:17:59.100 --> 04:18:00.170 align:start position:0%
um groups like uh Cooperative school
districts

04:18:00.170 --> 04:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
districts
 
04:18:05.630 --> 04:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
um in in what would it be issued by
 
04:18:08.389 --> 04:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
um a particular town or could it come
 
04:18:10.189 --> 04:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
from any Town
 
04:18:12.830 --> 04:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
um for any of the people that were that
 
04:18:15.349 --> 04:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
that participate on any of the school
 
04:18:17.269 --> 04:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
boards or the budget Committees of the
 
04:18:19.670 --> 04:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
school boards as well
 
04:18:22.250 --> 04:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question so
 
04:18:24.110 --> 04:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
um my thought process behind the bill is
 
04:18:27.590 --> 04:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
to allow uh you know my town clerk in
 
04:18:27.600 --> 04:18:28.610 align:start position:0%
to allow uh you know my town clerk in
Epping

04:18:28.610 --> 04:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
Epping
 
04:18:30.590 --> 04:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
um she has a stack of municipally
 
04:18:32.870 --> 04:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
elected uh details that she can
 
04:18:32.880 --> 04:18:34.370 align:start position:0%
elected uh details that she can
distribute

04:18:34.370 --> 04:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
distribute
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
um the representative of that board who
 
04:18:39.710 --> 04:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
chooses they would like to they choose
 
04:18:42.170 --> 04:18:42.180 align:start position:0%
to elect to purchase that detail and
 
04:18:44.090 --> 04:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
have that vanity plate
 
04:18:46.610 --> 04:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
um obviously understand some of the
 
04:18:48.250 --> 04:18:48.260 align:start position:0%
Amendments that I will intend to make
 
04:18:50.389 --> 04:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
and I do appreciate everybody bringing
 
04:18:51.530 --> 04:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
that up but
 
04:18:55.429 --> 04:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
um if Epping say cooperated with Fremont
 
04:18:57.830 --> 04:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
and Raymond they would also have said
 
04:19:00.110 --> 04:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
stack of details and a prawn showing
 
04:19:01.370 --> 04:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
proof that they are part of that
 
04:19:02.809 --> 04:19:02.819 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District school
 
04:19:04.910 --> 04:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
committee or budget committee they would
 
04:19:07.309 --> 04:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
also you know it would just be
 
04:19:10.969 --> 04:19:10.979 align:start position:0%
um you know you'd be just just like your
 
04:19:12.469 --> 04:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
regular plates whether in the town
 
04:19:14.929 --> 04:19:14.939 align:start position:0%
clerk's office
 
04:19:18.050 --> 04:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
uh last follow-up Mr chair
 
04:19:18.060 --> 04:19:21.490 align:start position:0%
uh last follow-up Mr chair
um

04:19:21.490 --> 04:19:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:23.269 --> 04:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:19:26.330 --> 04:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
um it would um you've mentioned a couple
 
04:19:28.370 --> 04:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
of time elected officials
 
04:19:31.010 --> 04:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming it would also transfer
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
to anyone that was appointed
 
04:19:36.590 --> 04:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
in essence yes sir it would
 
04:19:39.530 --> 04:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
representative um if someone was if say
 
04:19:42.590 --> 04:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
the board of Selectmen had a opening and
 
04:19:44.630 --> 04:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
they appointed somebody
 
04:19:46.670 --> 04:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
um by non-vote or even just planning
 
04:19:48.290 --> 04:19:48.300 align:start position:0%
board for example because that probably
 
04:19:51.229 --> 04:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
happens more often than not they are
 
04:19:55.130 --> 04:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
appointed uh they are sworn in yeah they
 
04:19:57.590 --> 04:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
are a municipal official
 
04:19:59.510 --> 04:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
 
04:19:59.520 --> 04:20:01.130 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
answers

04:20:01.130 --> 04:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
answers
 
04:20:03.309 --> 04:20:03.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Hill
 
04:20:05.330 --> 04:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
04:20:08.030 --> 04:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
 
04:20:11.030 --> 04:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
um having a little bit of
 
04:20:12.710 --> 04:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
symbol I think this is
 
04:20:15.290 --> 04:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
a fine idea in order to you know to make
 
04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
this for a small way that people are
 
04:20:21.050 --> 04:20:21.060 align:start position:0%
giving of their time and energy
 
04:20:23.929 --> 04:20:23.939 align:start position:0%
in municipal offices could be have a
 
04:20:25.269 --> 04:20:25.279 align:start position:0%
little bit of something for themselves
 
04:20:29.389 --> 04:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
my anxiety though comes from the whole
 
04:20:32.210 --> 04:20:32.220 align:start position:0%
how do the stickers get purchased who
 
04:20:34.969 --> 04:20:34.979 align:start position:0%
pays for that initially
 
04:20:37.550 --> 04:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
how is the money being handled most of
 
04:20:37.560 --> 04:20:38.870 align:start position:0%
how is the money being handled most of
the

04:20:38.870 --> 04:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:42.530 --> 04:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
most of the non-profit organizations to
 
04:20:44.870 --> 04:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
have taken this completely out of the
 
04:20:46.729 --> 04:20:46.739 align:start position:0%
hands that the financial piece
 
04:20:49.370 --> 04:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
completely out of the hands of DMV or
 
04:20:50.389 --> 04:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:20:53.510 --> 04:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm I don't know how this would all
 
04:20:56.510 --> 04:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
work and so it gives me a lot of anxiety
 
04:21:00.410 --> 04:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:03.469 --> 04:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I'm not sure if there is a
 
04:21:05.570 --> 04:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
mechanism under current law
 
04:21:05.580 --> 04:21:07.389 align:start position:0%
mechanism under current law
for

04:21:07.389 --> 04:21:07.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:21:11.150 --> 04:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
the state to take in money from the sale
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
of these stickers and then
 
04:21:15.309 --> 04:21:15.319 align:start position:0%
once those stickers are paid for
 
04:21:18.290 --> 04:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
anything remaining would go back to the
 
04:21:20.030 --> 04:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
general fund I understand what you would
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
tend to do but I'm not I don't see how
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
that could how that happens in in law or
 
04:21:29.870 --> 04:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:34.189 --> 04:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
so I just I bring that to your attention
 
04:21:34.199 --> 04:21:35.210 align:start position:0%
so I just I bring that to your attention
um

04:21:35.210 --> 04:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:38.269 --> 04:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
I I don't have a fix yet maybe you'll be
 
04:21:40.670 --> 04:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
able to find one for us between now and
 
04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
whenever we exec this bill
 
04:21:45.349 --> 04:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
that would be my hope representative
 
04:21:47.990 --> 04:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
Sykes thank you um I will definitely be
 
04:21:54.110 --> 04:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:58.130 --> 04:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:01.570 --> 04:22:01.580 align:start position:0%
well um I guess so I
 
04:22:05.150 --> 04:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
normally the the only other times we've
 
04:22:06.130 --> 04:22:06.140 align:start position:0%
had a
 
04:22:09.229 --> 04:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
semi-quasi state agency involved it
 
04:22:12.590 --> 04:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
happened to be the the Veterans Affairs
 
04:22:14.030 --> 04:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
folks and that was created by
 
04:22:16.729 --> 04:22:16.739 align:start position:0%
legislation as part of the whole decal
 
04:22:18.229 --> 04:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
plate program
 
04:22:21.050 --> 04:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure the DOT
 
04:22:22.670 --> 04:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
would have an answer for you if you're
 
04:22:25.370 --> 04:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
going to answer wouldn't you go to DMV
 
04:22:28.490 --> 04:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:31.070 --> 04:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess DMV would be also somebody
 
04:22:33.290 --> 04:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
that I should reach out to as well okay
 
04:22:34.849 --> 04:22:34.859 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to help you along not
 
04:22:36.710 --> 04:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
not trying to give you a hard time like
 
04:22:38.330 --> 04:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
I said no I get it I
 
04:22:40.610 --> 04:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
I it's an actual not a bad idea but I
 
04:22:42.110 --> 04:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
there's some
 
04:22:42.120 --> 04:22:43.790 align:start position:0%
there's some
some

04:22:43.790 --> 04:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:22:45.710 --> 04:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
technical details that we have to work
 
04:22:45.720 --> 04:22:46.490 align:start position:0%
technical details that we have to work
on

04:22:46.490 --> 04:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:22:53.050 --> 04:22:53.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
versus DMV
 
04:22:59.030 --> 04:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
um see representative Pulaski
 
04:23:01.250 --> 04:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you this is a question of the
 
04:23:03.349 --> 04:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
chair perhaps you or one of the other
 
04:23:05.450 --> 04:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
members who've been around longer than
 
04:23:08.510 --> 04:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
me could answer do you remember the
 
04:23:12.790 --> 04:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
history of putting the section
 
04:23:15.469 --> 04:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
b3a the firefighter decals in there
 
04:23:17.809 --> 04:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
because that seems similar in terms of a
 
04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
municipal local program for decals
 
04:23:25.010 --> 04:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
um but I'm not sure how that ended up
 
04:23:25.020 --> 04:23:27.250 align:start position:0%
um but I'm not sure how that ended up
here

04:23:27.250 --> 04:23:27.260 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:23:30.769 --> 04:23:30.779 align:start position:0%
well I vaguely remember it um I was here
 
04:23:32.870 --> 04:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
for the difference and that's why I
 
04:23:35.570 --> 04:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
brought the similarities up to this bill
 
04:23:39.469 --> 04:23:39.479 align:start position:0%
this morning even because it's municipal
 
04:23:42.050 --> 04:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
and it is an exception to
 
04:23:43.990 --> 04:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
the whole chapter
 
04:23:47.510 --> 04:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
even within it it spells out who issues
 
04:23:50.510 --> 04:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
the decals what the decals look like you
 
04:23:52.790 --> 04:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
happen to be for full-time and retired
 
04:23:55.010 --> 04:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
so there was no issue with women could
 
04:23:58.070 --> 04:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
be taking or should be taken away now I
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
don't know if that answers your question
 
04:24:02.269 --> 04:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
but that was my point although and again
 
04:24:03.950 --> 04:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
too I'm not opposed to this necessarily
 
04:24:07.870 --> 04:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:10.849 --> 04:24:10.859 align:start position:0%
and it just raises a lot of questions I
 
04:24:11.689 --> 04:24:11.699 align:start position:0%
don't know if that helped you
 
04:24:11.699 --> 04:24:13.070 align:start position:0%
don't know if that helped you
representative

04:24:13.070 --> 04:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:24:15.110 --> 04:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
it does thank you I just wanted a little
 
04:24:16.910 --> 04:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
more clarity on how that one exception
 
04:24:18.710 --> 04:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
got in there um as I've always
 
04:24:19.969 --> 04:24:19.979 align:start position:0%
understood the program to be a
 
04:24:22.010 --> 04:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
non-profit program thank you
 
04:24:22.020 --> 04:24:26.889 align:start position:0%
non-profit program thank you
George

04:24:26.889 --> 04:24:26.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:29.450 --> 04:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
yes this would also might be a question
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
for the chair but
 
04:24:31.199 --> 04:24:31.969 align:start position:0%
for the chair but
um

04:24:31.969 --> 04:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:34.870 --> 04:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
my recollection of the firefighter decal
 
04:24:37.429 --> 04:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
piece was that it was a very specific
 
04:24:40.429 --> 04:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
for them separate and distinct from
 
04:24:42.769 --> 04:24:42.779 align:start position:0%
authorized organizations and would and
 
04:24:45.290 --> 04:24:45.300 align:start position:0%
as the sponsor suggests he might want to
 
04:24:47.389 --> 04:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
put it in a different place within the
 
04:24:50.630 --> 04:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
irsas but I also recall that there was
 
04:24:52.090 --> 04:24:52.100 align:start position:0%
no fiscal
 
04:24:55.610 --> 04:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
involvement of the state in that program
 
04:24:58.729 --> 04:24:58.739 align:start position:0%
or in any town or city that the fire
 
04:24:58.739 --> 04:24:59.929 align:start position:0%
or in any town or city that the fire
department's

04:24:59.929 --> 04:24:59.939 align:start position:0%
department's
 
04:25:01.790 --> 04:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
would find the money to run their own
 
04:25:05.990 --> 04:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
stickers not wouldn't necessarily be
 
04:25:08.689 --> 04:25:08.699 align:start position:0%
anything that the state did
 
04:25:11.090 --> 04:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
is that not correct
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:19.809 --> 04:25:19.819 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
04:25:24.650 --> 04:25:24.660 align:start position:0%

the UNH was having the town clerks issue
 
04:25:28.969 --> 04:25:28.979 align:start position:0%

04:26:27.769 --> 04:26:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:31.070 --> 04:26:31.080 align:start position:0%

04:26:37.429 --> 04:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:26:37.439 --> 04:26:39.050 align:start position:0%
again
great

04:26:39.050 --> 04:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
great
 
04:26:42.050 --> 04:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
um as outlined by a number of
 
04:26:44.210 --> 04:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
um by a number of folks already we too
 
04:26:46.910 --> 04:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
found a handful of technical defects
 
04:26:49.670 --> 04:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
that we thought were a bit concerning
 
04:26:49.680 --> 04:26:50.630 align:start position:0%
that we thought were a bit concerning
um

04:26:50.630 --> 04:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:52.729 --> 04:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
first and foremost
 
04:26:55.309 --> 04:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
um you know being the intent other than
 
04:26:57.649 --> 04:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
firefighters being
 
04:26:57.659 --> 04:26:59.149 align:start position:0%
firefighters being
um

04:26:59.149 --> 04:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:01.870 --> 04:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
section 501
 
04:27:05.689 --> 04:27:05.699 align:start position:0%
tax exempt was our first
 
04:27:09.649 --> 04:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
we also in section 261 B3 in the in the
 
04:27:12.110 --> 04:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
beginning this is also the intent shall
 
04:27:13.849 --> 04:27:13.859 align:start position:0%
not be named for associated with
 
04:27:16.490 --> 04:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
political issue or a person who seeks
 
04:27:20.030 --> 04:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
holds or has held a public office
 
04:27:22.370 --> 04:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
um that was a bit concerning as well and
 
04:27:24.950 --> 04:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
then we also with lack of definition for
 
04:27:28.189 --> 04:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
what a municipal officer is
 
04:27:31.790 --> 04:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
um and there being a lack of
 
04:27:34.189 --> 04:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
um display here to show proof of office
 
04:27:36.889 --> 04:27:36.899 align:start position:0%
and how one would do that
 
04:27:41.210 --> 04:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:43.130 --> 04:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
in the event that somebody no longer
 
04:27:45.170 --> 04:27:45.180 align:start position:0%
holds a public office who is responsible
 
04:27:48.290 --> 04:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
to take that play to that decal back
 
04:27:51.290 --> 04:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
if there's an Enforcement issue
 
04:27:53.389 --> 04:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
with somebody refusing to give up that
 
04:27:55.370 --> 04:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
plate who does that responsibility fall
 
04:27:55.380 --> 04:27:56.330 align:start position:0%
plate who does that responsibility fall
to

04:27:56.330 --> 04:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:27:58.790 --> 04:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
and those with a handful of technical
 
04:28:01.490 --> 04:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
defects again that we'd heard but I did
 
04:28:05.210 --> 04:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
want to add to the end
 
04:28:07.189 --> 04:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
what happens when somebody refuses to
 
04:28:08.630 --> 04:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
give up that
 
04:28:11.330 --> 04:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
decal and they're no longer
 
04:28:14.210 --> 04:28:14.220 align:start position:0%
associated with the municipality
 
04:28:16.070 --> 04:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll be willing to take
 
04:28:19.309 --> 04:28:19.319 align:start position:0%

I'm here to present to you house bill
 
04:58:07.490 --> 04:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
423 which establishes a commission to
 
04:58:09.368 --> 04:58:09.378 align:start position:0%
study the implementation of enhanced
 
04:58:13.010 --> 04:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
automation of traffic lights
 
04:58:14.390 --> 04:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a little bit of background
 
04:58:16.368 --> 04:58:16.378 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
04:58:17.930 --> 04:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
um with the attendance
 
04:58:22.310 --> 04:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
I brought this bill for in a large term
 
04:58:24.948 --> 04:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
last year as a matter of fact and the
 
04:58:26.270 --> 04:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
reason I made it a commission the reason
 
04:58:28.490 --> 04:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
it's back as a commission is because
 
04:58:31.190 --> 04:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to do getting this going
 
04:58:32.690 --> 04:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
um it's going to ultimately take some
 
04:58:35.330 --> 04:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
money to uh to go to Spotlight
 
04:58:37.850 --> 04:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
technology and I felt it was a good idea
 
04:58:39.770 --> 04:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
to start with a commission to get it off
 
04:58:40.730 --> 04:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
the ground
 
04:58:45.050 --> 04:58:45.060 align:start position:0%
and um this this bill passed both the
 
04:58:46.670 --> 04:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
House and Senate like she ain't got
 
04:58:49.430 --> 04:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
bogged down with some of the bus bills
 
04:58:51.288 --> 04:58:51.298 align:start position:0%
and the uh you know
 
04:58:52.850 --> 04:58:52.860 align:start position:0%
the fact that a bunch of bills just
 
04:58:54.050 --> 04:58:54.060 align:start position:0%
didn't get uh
 
04:58:56.208 --> 04:58:56.218 align:start position:0%
through the process completely after uh
 
04:58:59.270 --> 04:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
the covet constructs so so I'm back at
 
04:59:00.770 --> 04:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
it again
 
04:59:03.170 --> 04:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a good idea in the state
 
04:59:05.930 --> 04:59:05.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know uh I bet mostly at one
 
04:59:07.250 --> 04:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
point or another have sat at a traffic
 
04:59:07.260 --> 04:59:08.150 align:start position:0%
point or another have sat at a traffic
light

04:59:08.150 --> 04:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
light
 
04:59:10.010 --> 04:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
04:59:13.010 --> 04:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
um while you're waiting for the light to
 
04:59:14.750 --> 04:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
turn and there's nobody coming on the
 
04:59:17.690 --> 04:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
sidewinds so you know it's an
 
04:59:19.970 --> 04:59:19.980 align:start position:0%
inefficient system we have right now
 
04:59:21.530 --> 04:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
having said that we're better than many
 
04:59:23.810 --> 04:59:23.820 align:start position:0%
states we have
 
04:59:26.030 --> 04:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
kind of a phase one of the spotlight
 
04:59:28.610 --> 04:59:28.620 align:start position:0%
technology in that we have
 
04:59:28.620 --> 04:59:29.690 align:start position:0%
technology in that we have
um

04:59:29.690 --> 04:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:32.170 --> 04:59:32.180 align:start position:0%
sensors on many of our
 
04:59:34.850 --> 04:59:34.860 align:start position:0%
intersections that
 
04:59:37.310 --> 04:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
at least when you if you're on a side
 
04:59:39.770 --> 04:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
road when you when you pull up to the
 
04:59:42.250 --> 04:59:42.260 align:start position:0%
sensor the light will eventually turn
 
04:59:45.590 --> 04:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
how emotions works though is it's it's
 
04:59:48.948 --> 04:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
used they use historical data of what
 
04:59:50.448 --> 04:59:50.458 align:start position:0%
the traffic is in that area so there's
 
04:59:53.090 --> 04:59:53.100 align:start position:0%
times you'll sit there for a while while
 
04:59:55.070 --> 04:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
there's nobody coming so what spot like
 
04:59:57.170 --> 04:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
technology does
 
05:00:00.170 --> 05:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
um is it um
 
05:00:04.970 --> 05:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
it uses technology to
 
05:00:07.490 --> 05:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
get rid of some of that delay for
 
05:00:07.500 --> 05:00:08.510 align:start position:0%
get rid of some of that delay for
example

05:00:08.510 --> 05:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:00:11.090 --> 05:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
um if you have in combination with the
 
05:00:12.830 --> 05:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
sensor and the
 
05:00:12.840 --> 05:00:13.910 align:start position:0%
sensor and the
um

05:00:13.910 --> 05:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:16.190 --> 05:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
the jab on the road and then an eye up
 
05:00:18.530 --> 05:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
above you will see when traffic's coming
 
05:00:21.410 --> 05:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
so I know personally several times I've
 
05:00:24.470 --> 05:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
sat on a side road watched the uh
 
05:00:26.150 --> 05:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know the lights red nobody's coming
 
05:00:27.170 --> 05:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
the other way
 
05:00:31.368 --> 05:00:31.378 align:start position:0%
by the time this the sensor activates
 
05:00:33.170 --> 05:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
and it turns it green to me now there's
 
05:00:35.270 --> 05:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
traffic on the on the main road that
 
05:00:35.280 --> 05:00:36.170 align:start position:0%
traffic on the on the main road that
definitely

05:00:36.170 --> 05:00:36.180 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
05:00:39.170 --> 05:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
so with a with an eye you can he can
 
05:00:40.430 --> 05:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
take he can
 
05:00:42.550 --> 05:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
that would be kind of phase one of
 
05:00:45.110 --> 05:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
enhancing our lights it would allow
 
05:00:47.448 --> 05:00:47.458 align:start position:0%
individual lights to be more efficient
 
05:00:50.270 --> 05:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
in a lot of traffic to Florida more uh
 
05:00:52.910 --> 05:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
you know sufficient way
 
05:00:55.910 --> 05:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
phase two would be then having
 
05:00:59.150 --> 05:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
the light stock to each other and when
 
05:01:00.650 --> 05:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
that happens and you can
 
05:01:04.730 --> 05:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
have efficiencies uh much greater for us
 
05:01:06.890 --> 05:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
now obviously and what I'm talking about
 
05:01:09.288 --> 05:01:09.298 align:start position:0%
here is only the traffic lights that are
 
05:01:10.970 --> 05:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
owned by the state of New Hampshire so
 
05:01:14.270 --> 05:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
most towns well most small towns are
 
05:01:16.070 --> 05:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
probably State like but in in cities
 
05:01:17.690 --> 05:01:17.700 align:start position:0%
they're they're city of light so it
 
05:01:19.128 --> 05:01:19.138 align:start position:0%
won't affect those
 
05:01:21.890 --> 05:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
but in places that have used this
 
05:01:24.170 --> 05:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
technology and gotten up to speed uh
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
State of Rhode Island uses it in places
 
05:01:28.730 --> 05:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
as many cities that use it you can see
 
05:01:32.208 --> 05:01:32.218 align:start position:0%
travel times uh increased by as much as
 
05:01:34.190 --> 05:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
25 percent
 
05:01:34.200 --> 05:01:35.868 align:start position:0%
25 percent
delays

05:01:35.868 --> 05:01:35.878 align:start position:0%
delays
 
05:01:37.788 --> 05:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
waiting in intersections and drop as
 
05:01:41.570 --> 05:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
much as 40 30 to 40 percent less stops
 
05:01:44.090 --> 05:01:44.100 align:start position:0%
at traffic lights which is quite safe
 
05:01:47.448 --> 05:01:47.458 align:start position:0%
with drivers and with reduced
 
05:01:51.050 --> 05:01:51.060 align:start position:0%
we run tires or breaks and so forth and
 
05:01:52.970 --> 05:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
for people that maybe don't care about
 
05:01:55.368 --> 05:01:55.378 align:start position:0%
sitting there the other advantages up to
 
05:01:58.430 --> 05:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
a 20 reduction in their vehicle
 
05:02:00.650 --> 05:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
emissions so it seems like a win-win
 
05:02:03.470 --> 05:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
situation in my mind and so I hope you
 
05:02:05.448 --> 05:02:05.458 align:start position:0%
consider um
 
05:02:08.330 --> 05:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill and uh passing it
 
05:02:13.150 --> 05:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:15.530 --> 05:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
I think that's pretty much everything I
 
05:02:17.930 --> 05:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
wanted to say about it other than I did
 
05:02:17.940 --> 05:02:19.670 align:start position:0%
wanted to say about it other than I did
send

05:02:19.670 --> 05:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
send
 
05:02:22.070 --> 05:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
earlier today to the chairman to
 
05:02:25.788 --> 05:02:25.798 align:start position:0%
disseminate a link for a company that
 
05:02:27.830 --> 05:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
I've talked to would be glad to just
 
05:02:29.030 --> 05:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
find the information the committee would
 
05:02:30.830 --> 05:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
like some other companies out there
 
05:02:33.650 --> 05:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
company called rapid flow that has
 
05:02:35.208 --> 05:02:35.218 align:start position:0%
implemented this technology in many
 
05:02:37.550 --> 05:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
places and so
 
05:02:40.310 --> 05:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
um with that I'll open it up if any
 
05:02:43.310 --> 05:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
committee members have a question
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
05:03:00.788 --> 05:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:04.368 --> 05:03:04.378 align:start position:0%
no it's simply a sensitive to you could
 
05:03:07.070 --> 05:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
almost even call it a motion sensor to
 
05:03:09.948 --> 05:03:09.958 align:start position:0%
determine traffic's coming right now you
 
05:03:12.110 --> 05:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
have the sensor on the road that the
 
05:03:13.490 --> 05:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
vehicle pulls up to the sensor and
 
05:03:15.410 --> 05:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
nobody there eventually changes it
 
05:03:17.270 --> 05:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't know whether it's traffic coming
 
05:03:20.990 --> 05:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:31.550 --> 05:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:33.708 --> 05:03:33.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:03:37.910 --> 05:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
um representative torosion on
 
05:03:41.208 --> 05:03:41.218 align:start position:0%
line 17 of your bill talks about the
 
05:03:43.070 --> 05:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
commission shell study the
 
05:03:46.070 --> 05:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
implementation of enhanced automation of
 
05:03:47.628 --> 05:03:47.638 align:start position:0%
traffic lights and I just wondered if
 
05:03:49.430 --> 05:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
you had a little more detail about what
 
05:03:53.030 --> 05:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
enhanced automation meant
 
05:04:01.368 --> 05:04:01.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:04.190 --> 05:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
go under under Park line 17 the
 
05:04:08.750 --> 05:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:08.760 --> 05:04:22.628 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:04:22.628 --> 05:04:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:26.628 --> 05:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
so on line 17 it's it's the owner line
 
05:04:28.490 --> 05:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
that talks about the charge of the
 
05:04:31.010 --> 05:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
commission and it says it shall study
 
05:04:32.890 --> 05:04:32.900 align:start position:0%
the implementation of enhanced
 
05:04:35.330 --> 05:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
automation of traffic lights and I
 
05:04:37.368 --> 05:04:37.378 align:start position:0%
wondered if we had
 
05:04:39.830 --> 05:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
if representative torosion had more
 
05:04:43.250 --> 05:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
detail about what is meant by enhanced
 
05:04:43.260 --> 05:04:45.110 align:start position:0%
detail about what is meant by enhanced
automation

05:04:45.110 --> 05:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
automation
 
05:04:48.050 --> 05:04:48.060 align:start position:0%
well it's basically what I was referring
 
05:04:59.150 --> 05:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:02.330 --> 05:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
to study the uh what I just said the
 
05:05:03.948 --> 05:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
efficiencies that could be gained in the
 
05:05:08.090 --> 05:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:10.788 --> 05:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
can I have a follow-up Mr chairman
 
05:05:13.368 --> 05:05:13.378 align:start position:0%
yeah he still he was still speaking
 
05:05:17.330 --> 05:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
maybe you can't hear him no I can't no
 
05:05:19.070 --> 05:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
before that microphone a little closer
 
05:05:19.080 --> 05:05:20.628 align:start position:0%
before that microphone a little closer
perhaps

05:05:20.628 --> 05:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
05:05:22.128 --> 05:05:22.138 align:start position:0%
representative can you hear me any
 
05:05:24.948 --> 05:05:24.958 align:start position:0%
better now yes
 
05:05:26.090 --> 05:05:26.100 align:start position:0%
I guess I didn't have the mic close
 
05:05:28.070 --> 05:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
enough I apologize so what I was saying
 
05:05:29.868 --> 05:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
was on the line 17 the commission shall
 
05:05:31.850 --> 05:05:31.860 align:start position:0%
studied the implementation of enhanced
 
05:05:34.128 --> 05:05:34.138 align:start position:0%
automation of traffic lights and what
 
05:05:37.730 --> 05:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:39.590 --> 05:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
several pieces to get this implemented
 
05:05:41.510 --> 05:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
first of all you want to study and see
 
05:05:44.448 --> 05:05:44.458 align:start position:0%
where it would be the fact of and then
 
05:05:51.368 --> 05:05:51.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:54.708 --> 05:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
perhaps busier intersections where you
 
05:05:57.050 --> 05:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
have potential of getting more you know
 
05:06:00.190 --> 05:06:00.200 align:start position:0%
efficiencies for the less ones
 
05:06:07.250 --> 05:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:08.930 --> 05:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
who communicate with each other it
 
05:06:10.910 --> 05:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
actually uses intelligence some of the
 
05:06:13.490 --> 05:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
Sonata systems who have gain the
 
05:06:15.410 --> 05:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
efficiencies we're looking for
 
05:06:18.110 --> 05:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
um so the basically Commission in a
 
05:06:20.208 --> 05:06:20.218 align:start position:0%
nutshell would be
 
05:06:24.470 --> 05:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:28.430 --> 05:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
the ground in in and come up best way to
 
05:06:30.830 --> 05:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
implement it in the state ultimately we
 
05:06:33.470 --> 05:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
may have to go back and have a bill to
 
05:06:35.930 --> 05:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
enact that but it's it's kind of phase
 
05:06:37.670 --> 05:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
one of trying to get the
 
05:06:40.490 --> 05:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
thing off the ground
 
05:06:42.470 --> 05:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you could I have a follow-up Mr
 
05:06:42.480 --> 05:06:43.730 align:start position:0%
thank you could I have a follow-up Mr
chairman

05:06:43.730 --> 05:06:43.740 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:06:43.740 --> 05:06:46.310 align:start position:0%
chairman
yeah

05:06:46.310 --> 05:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:46.320 --> 05:06:47.510 align:start position:0%
 
boy

05:06:47.510 --> 05:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
boy
 
05:06:49.970 --> 05:06:49.980 align:start position:0%
um sorry but a lot of
 
05:06:52.070 --> 05:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
I presume you gave me permission so I'll
 
05:06:54.770 --> 05:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
continue sorry um
 
05:06:57.590 --> 05:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
George representative Sykes I'm as close
 
05:06:59.390 --> 05:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
to this microphone as I dare get am I
 
05:07:01.190 --> 05:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
coming in any better now yeah that's
 
05:07:03.708 --> 05:07:03.718 align:start position:0%
better I presume you gave me permission
 
05:07:05.810 --> 05:07:05.820 align:start position:0%
yes you did you did thank you
 
05:07:07.910 --> 05:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative torosion so as I
 
05:07:09.948 --> 05:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
understand what you've the bill presents
 
05:07:13.610 --> 05:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
it's more about the implementation of
 
05:07:13.620 --> 05:07:14.690 align:start position:0%
it's more about the implementation of
um

05:07:14.690 --> 05:07:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:18.050 --> 05:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
existing systems that might apply to
 
05:07:19.730 --> 05:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
traffic signals
 
05:07:23.330 --> 05:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
and my question is had you given any
 
05:07:27.830 --> 05:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
thought about also studying
 
05:07:29.868 --> 05:07:29.878 align:start position:0%
what other systems may be coming down
 
05:07:32.690 --> 05:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
the road as well so as an example
 
05:07:35.750 --> 05:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's one thing to talk about existing
 
05:07:38.868 --> 05:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
systems that we have now but in the not
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
too near
 
05:07:40.320 --> 05:07:42.230 align:start position:0%
too near
future

05:07:42.230 --> 05:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:07:42.240 --> 05:07:43.670 align:start position:0%
future
um

05:07:43.670 --> 05:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:46.368 --> 05:07:46.378 align:start position:0%
traffic lights traffic signals will be
 
05:07:48.948 --> 05:07:48.958 align:start position:0%
able to talk to automated Vehicles I'm
 
05:07:50.390 --> 05:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
not talking about cars that drive
 
05:07:52.670 --> 05:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
themselves but rather that cars have
 
05:07:54.708 --> 05:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
systems that allow them to talk to the
 
05:07:57.170 --> 05:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
signals as well as the signals to talk
 
05:08:00.288 --> 05:08:00.298 align:start position:0%
back to the cars and I know dot is doing
 
05:08:02.930 --> 05:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
a lot of work on that but I I wonder if
 
05:08:05.090 --> 05:08:05.100 align:start position:0%
that should be included in the scope
 
05:08:07.610 --> 05:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
of your bill
 
05:08:08.930 --> 05:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
um yeah I would agree with that
 
05:08:08.940 --> 05:08:10.550 align:start position:0%
um yeah I would agree with that
certainly

05:08:10.550 --> 05:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:08:10.560 --> 05:08:18.350 align:start position:0%
certainly
um

05:08:18.350 --> 05:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:21.948 --> 05:08:21.958 align:start position:0%
uh yeah go ahead it's very poor but I
 
05:08:25.070 --> 05:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
think I've got you better now
 
05:08:25.080 --> 05:08:26.690 align:start position:0%
think I've got you better now
yeah

05:08:26.690 --> 05:08:26.700 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:08:30.050 --> 05:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
so ultimately sure the idea is to get
 
05:08:31.788 --> 05:08:31.798 align:start position:0%
this off the ground you know you gotta
 
05:08:33.530 --> 05:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
for all before your walk so to speak so
 
05:08:37.610 --> 05:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:37.620 --> 05:08:52.490 align:start position:0%
 
local

05:08:52.490 --> 05:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:52.500 --> 05:09:00.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:09:00.250 --> 05:09:00.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:02.990 --> 05:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
and I think you may not be able to hear
 
05:09:03.000 --> 05:09:04.190 align:start position:0%
and I think you may not be able to hear
me

05:09:04.190 --> 05:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:09:06.650 --> 05:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure that I'm the only one
 
05:09:07.730 --> 05:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
who can't
 
05:09:07.740 --> 05:09:08.930 align:start position:0%
who can't
um

05:09:08.930 --> 05:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:12.050 --> 05:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
it's it's a bit of a problem I I'll take
 
05:09:14.330 --> 05:09:14.340 align:start position:0%
it from you that you that maybe you
 
05:09:15.708 --> 05:09:15.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
05:09:15.718 --> 05:09:16.910 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
um

05:09:16.910 --> 05:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:19.070 --> 05:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to an amendment that included
 
05:09:20.770 --> 05:09:20.780 align:start position:0%
additional language to look at
 
05:09:23.570 --> 05:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
technology not just an implementation
 
05:09:23.580 --> 05:09:25.190 align:start position:0%
technology not just an implementation
policy

05:09:25.190 --> 05:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
policy
 
05:09:27.288 --> 05:09:27.298 align:start position:0%
I I would agree with that I would
 
05:09:28.970 --> 05:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
certainly be agree with that and
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately that is part of what we're
 
05:09:37.310 --> 05:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:37.320 --> 05:09:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:09:43.750 --> 05:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:47.390 --> 05:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:47.400 --> 05:09:48.770 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:09:48.770 --> 05:09:48.780 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:09:51.708 --> 05:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
uh again I don't think it's just me but
 
05:09:54.410 --> 05:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
uh it is better right this second
 
05:09:55.850 --> 05:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
I've got it right I don't know if you
 
05:09:57.310 --> 05:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
can you probably can't have same people
 
05:09:59.810 --> 05:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
I've got it right here anyway four
 
05:10:01.550 --> 05:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
inches from my mouth so anyway I hope I
 
05:10:03.530 --> 05:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
answered that question yeah anyway yeah
 
05:10:05.390 --> 05:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
I think you did these people who haven't
 
05:10:07.010 --> 05:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
happened having a hard time hearing this
 
05:10:13.310 --> 05:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:15.350 --> 05:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I understand but thanks and I kind
 
05:10:16.730 --> 05:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
of agree with them rather than making
 
05:10:19.868 --> 05:10:19.878 align:start position:0%
the charge too big maybe more detail
 
05:10:22.190 --> 05:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
it's a simple Amendment would be helpful
 
05:10:25.490 --> 05:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
sure I wouldn't be opposed to that
 
05:10:28.190 --> 05:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
05:10:31.850 --> 05:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
yep it was up ataro thank you Mr chair
 
05:10:35.690 --> 05:10:35.700 align:start position:0%
um and uh thank you representative uh
 
05:10:35.700 --> 05:10:37.368 align:start position:0%
um and uh thank you representative uh
ferocian

05:10:37.368 --> 05:10:37.378 align:start position:0%
ferocian
 
05:10:37.378 --> 05:10:38.750 align:start position:0%
ferocian
um

05:10:38.750 --> 05:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:41.208 --> 05:10:41.218 align:start position:0%
uh line 28
 
05:10:41.218 --> 05:10:41.990 align:start position:0%
uh line 28
um

05:10:41.990 --> 05:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:45.050 --> 05:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
to me this sort of thing seems complex
 
05:10:47.810 --> 05:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
and has a lot of inherent variables like
 
05:10:49.730 --> 05:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
you listed out four or five variables
 
05:10:51.830 --> 05:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
already about which lights do which
 
05:10:55.070 --> 05:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
lights don't the technology itself Etc
 
05:10:58.610 --> 05:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
in in this in this bill it says to
 
05:11:01.128 --> 05:11:01.138 align:start position:0%
sunset on November 1st 2021. you think
 
05:11:03.170 --> 05:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
that is enough time should the committee
 
05:11:05.990 --> 05:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
be formed to review all this
 
05:11:08.868 --> 05:11:08.878 align:start position:0%
um it's not a lot of time the the chair
 
05:11:12.050 --> 05:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
may explain to you further why those
 
05:11:14.570 --> 05:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
dates out the way they are
 
05:11:16.310 --> 05:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
typically for these they've got a report
 
05:11:17.750 --> 05:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
for the next session
 
05:11:20.270 --> 05:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
and so that's why you see section one
 
05:11:23.030 --> 05:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
take effect and then it then then the
 
05:11:25.490 --> 05:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
sun sets itself so if they didn't get
 
05:11:27.110 --> 05:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
all their work done then the best way
 
05:11:29.510 --> 05:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
would be to do another study commission
 
05:11:32.208 --> 05:11:32.218 align:start position:0%
and start over all right in other words
 
05:11:34.010 --> 05:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
we commission's not going to go on for
 
05:11:36.110 --> 05:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
years and years and years
 
05:11:38.750 --> 05:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
seeing as how we're only here for two
 
05:11:41.330 --> 05:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
so basically at the report something by
 
05:11:43.250 --> 05:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
that time right I see okay if it's
 
05:11:44.930 --> 05:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
insufficient then then the next step
 
05:11:46.850 --> 05:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
would be to reintroduce through another
 
05:11:50.330 --> 05:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
commission I see okay you know if I may
 
05:11:53.090 --> 05:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chair if enough work
 
05:11:56.030 --> 05:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
is completed it may lead to introduction
 
05:11:59.830 --> 05:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
of a further legislation next year if
 
05:12:03.410 --> 05:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
unlikely would be that quick but to get
 
05:12:06.110 --> 05:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
the ball rolling another step closely
 
05:12:08.810 --> 05:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
in getting lights installed because the
 
05:12:09.890 --> 05:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
commission's not going to have the
 
05:12:11.770 --> 05:12:11.780 align:start position:0%
authority to do that per se
 
05:12:14.868 --> 05:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
but it's it's it's the getting it off
 
05:12:17.330 --> 05:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
the ground getting the discussion going
 
05:12:21.948 --> 05:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
I see okay the end goal of a committee
 
05:12:23.868 --> 05:12:23.878 align:start position:0%
study committee or a commission
 
05:12:25.670 --> 05:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
is to have enough recommendations that
 
05:12:26.868 --> 05:12:26.878 align:start position:0%
there is something that the guy can
 
05:12:28.910 --> 05:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
actually file a bill with so that's the
 
05:12:31.970 --> 05:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
goal I see Joe representative Sykes with
 
05:12:33.770 --> 05:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
his hand back up
 
05:12:36.948 --> 05:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:36.958 --> 05:12:38.208 align:start position:0%
 
question

05:12:38.208 --> 05:12:38.218 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:12:39.770 --> 05:12:39.780 align:start position:0%
I know the Senate
 
05:12:42.170 --> 05:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
Senate typically
 
05:12:42.180 --> 05:12:43.910 align:start position:0%
Senate typically
um

05:12:43.910 --> 05:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:45.590 --> 05:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know how I quite want to say
 
05:12:48.948 --> 05:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
this they often have trouble accepting
 
05:12:52.490 --> 05:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
bills for commissions and uh in line
 
05:12:56.030 --> 05:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
seven I'm sorry line eight there's three
 
05:12:58.490 --> 05:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
members of the Senate I have never seen
 
05:13:00.470 --> 05:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
three members of the Senate appointed to
 
05:13:02.868 --> 05:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
a commission we're usually lucky to get
 
05:13:05.810 --> 05:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
one I I wonder if you if you feel that
 
05:13:07.390 --> 05:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
this might be a problem
 
05:13:10.010 --> 05:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
well I I'll take that one if you don't
 
05:13:12.050 --> 05:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
mind that you are absolutely right
 
05:13:12.060 --> 05:13:14.090 align:start position:0%
mind that you are absolutely right
representative

05:13:14.090 --> 05:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:13:15.770 --> 05:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
we send them
 
05:13:17.330 --> 05:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
the committee or commission with two
 
05:13:19.070 --> 05:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
they usually if they even like the
 
05:13:21.230 --> 05:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
context they'll amend it and make it one
 
05:13:22.850 --> 05:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
and then that one won't show up either
 
05:13:22.860 --> 05:13:24.470 align:start position:0%
and then that one won't show up either
so

05:13:24.470 --> 05:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:13:26.690 --> 05:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
um leave it up to the sponsor and if he
 
05:13:28.970 --> 05:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
would like to make a possible change to
 
05:13:31.368 --> 05:13:31.378 align:start position:0%
that but uh point taken
 
05:13:34.310 --> 05:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah I'd be fine with that I
 
05:13:35.868 --> 05:13:35.878 align:start position:0%
was trying to keep it balanced uh trying
 
05:13:38.270 --> 05:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
to keep you know
 
05:13:41.810 --> 05:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
make it so that there'd be more interest
 
05:13:43.970 --> 05:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
in supporting it as as opposed to less
 
05:13:45.650 --> 05:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
and sometimes you get into turf wars
 
05:13:47.750 --> 05:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
where you know you guys have three
 
05:13:50.628 --> 05:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
members we only have one but Point well
 
05:13:52.850 --> 05:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
taken I'm certainly uh agreeable to
 
05:13:53.990 --> 05:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
amend that
 
05:13:54.000 --> 05:14:05.708 align:start position:0%
amend that
foreign

05:14:05.708 --> 05:14:05.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:05.718 --> 05:14:07.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:14:07.310 --> 05:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:14:11.810 --> 05:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:18.170 --> 05:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:20.150 --> 05:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Lambert from the Department of
 
05:14:20.160 --> 05:14:30.170 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Lambert from the Department of
Transportation

05:14:30.170 --> 05:14:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:32.030 --> 05:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
good morning or good afternoon can you
 
05:14:33.530 --> 05:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
uh can you all hear me
 
05:14:36.410 --> 05:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
hear you all right thank you
 
05:14:39.890 --> 05:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman uh thank you for inviting
 
05:14:42.590 --> 05:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
me or to speak and thank you members of
 
05:14:44.448 --> 05:14:44.458 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record my name
 
05:14:45.948 --> 05:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
is Bill Lambert I'm the state traffic
 
05:14:47.090 --> 05:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
engineer for the New Hampshire
 
05:14:48.830 --> 05:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation
 
05:14:50.990 --> 05:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh and I guess I'd start by asking if
 
05:14:53.390 --> 05:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
you were able to get the uh the written
 
05:14:55.490 --> 05:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
testimony that I submitted
 
05:14:58.490 --> 05:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
I submitted a letter kind of providing
 
05:14:59.930 --> 05:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
some background into traffic signal
 
05:15:01.190 --> 05:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
development and I'm seeing a couple head
 
05:15:01.200 --> 05:15:03.430 align:start position:0%
development and I'm seeing a couple head
nods

05:15:03.430 --> 05:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
nods
 
05:15:06.170 --> 05:15:06.180 align:start position:0%
so I won't read that I'll just kind of
 
05:15:06.180 --> 05:15:08.270 align:start position:0%
so I won't read that I'll just kind of
summarize

05:15:08.270 --> 05:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
summarize
 
05:15:10.910 --> 05:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
um for the purpose of this hearing so
 
05:15:12.590 --> 05:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation uh
 
05:15:14.690 --> 05:15:14.700 align:start position:0%
supports any effort to improve Mobility
 
05:15:17.510 --> 05:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
on on state highways and all highways so
 
05:15:18.770 --> 05:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
we'd certainly look forward to working
 
05:15:21.770 --> 05:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
with the commission uh on that in that
 
05:15:21.780 --> 05:15:22.730 align:start position:0%
with the commission uh on that in that
regard

05:15:22.730 --> 05:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
regard
 
05:15:24.170 --> 05:15:24.180 align:start position:0%
um but I did want you to give be aware
 
05:15:25.550 --> 05:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
of kind of the history of traffic
 
05:15:27.770 --> 05:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
signals in the in the state
 
05:15:29.090 --> 05:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
um first traffic signal I think the
 
05:15:30.830 --> 05:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
first traffic signal in the state was
 
05:15:33.890 --> 05:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
installed in 1949 I want to say that was
 
05:15:35.208 --> 05:15:35.218 align:start position:0%
in Manchester
 
05:15:37.250 --> 05:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know precisely where that was
 
05:15:39.288 --> 05:15:39.298 align:start position:0%
but the first state traffic signal
 
05:15:42.110 --> 05:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
started popping up in the 1950s more in
 
05:15:43.208 --> 05:15:43.218 align:start position:0%
the 60s
 
05:15:45.770 --> 05:15:45.780 align:start position:0%
mostly in kind of the rural State
 
05:15:48.350 --> 05:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
Highway to State Highway intersection
 
05:15:50.390 --> 05:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
um time traffic signals and
 
05:15:52.310 --> 05:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
signalization was more common in the
 
05:15:54.948 --> 05:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
urban areas Manchester Nashua
 
05:15:56.810 --> 05:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
um Salem places like that
 
05:15:59.050 --> 05:15:59.060 align:start position:0%
um and less common on the state highways
 
05:16:01.550 --> 05:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
but over the years
 
05:16:04.070 --> 05:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
um as some of the commercial corridors
 
05:16:06.050 --> 05:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
started expanding and you'd start string
 
05:16:06.060 --> 05:16:07.550 align:start position:0%
started expanding and you'd start string
several

05:16:07.550 --> 05:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
several
 
05:16:09.948 --> 05:16:09.958 align:start position:0%
um traffic signals together the um
 
05:16:11.930 --> 05:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
coordinated system started to come in
 
05:16:14.690 --> 05:16:14.700 align:start position:0%
probably in the 1980s where particularly
 
05:16:17.510 --> 05:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
places like 101a and Nashua Amherst
 
05:16:19.850 --> 05:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
Milford where you would have several
 
05:16:21.410 --> 05:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
traffic signals kind of consecutively
 
05:16:23.930 --> 05:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
within a half mile of each other uh so
 
05:16:25.310 --> 05:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
you would start stringing those together
 
05:16:28.310 --> 05:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
with interconnected cables uh and you
 
05:16:29.868 --> 05:16:29.878 align:start position:0%
would have timing plans that would time
 
05:16:32.750 --> 05:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
a progression so that once you're in the
 
05:16:35.030 --> 05:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
the progression or on the corridor you
 
05:16:37.910 --> 05:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
would theoretically be able to
 
05:16:39.770 --> 05:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
um catch green light after green light
 
05:16:42.830 --> 05:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:44.390 --> 05:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
that works best when there's full
 
05:16:45.890 --> 05:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
traffic it doesn't work so well when
 
05:16:47.090 --> 05:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of traffic because
 
05:16:48.590 --> 05:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
then you get the situation that
 
05:16:50.448 --> 05:16:50.458 align:start position:0%
representative torosion spoke about
 
05:16:52.368 --> 05:16:52.378 align:start position:0%
where somebody might be sitting at a
 
05:16:53.868 --> 05:16:53.878 align:start position:0%
side road looking at no traffic coming
 
05:16:56.150 --> 05:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
along not wondering why they have to
 
05:16:58.070 --> 05:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
wait so long uh when what they're really
 
05:17:00.830 --> 05:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
doing is waiting for that progression uh
 
05:17:03.050 --> 05:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
to start at one end and continue all the
 
05:17:04.490 --> 05:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
way through
 
05:17:04.500 --> 05:17:05.390 align:start position:0%
way through
um

05:17:05.390 --> 05:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:07.490 --> 05:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
traffic signals is representative to
 
05:17:10.250 --> 05:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
Trojan said that there's sensors and
 
05:17:13.128 --> 05:17:13.138 align:start position:0%
traffic signals all of the State traffic
 
05:17:16.368 --> 05:17:16.378 align:start position:0%
signals so 450 traffic signals or so
 
05:17:18.770 --> 05:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
do have what we call actuation or
 
05:17:20.628 --> 05:17:20.638 align:start position:0%
they're fully actuated which means that
 
05:17:22.788 --> 05:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
every movement
 
05:17:25.128 --> 05:17:25.138 align:start position:0%
um is detected so every lane every every
 
05:17:27.530 --> 05:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
turning lane would be detected either by
 
05:17:30.110 --> 05:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
inductive Loops in the pavement or by
 
05:17:32.570 --> 05:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
cameras more recently
 
05:17:34.550 --> 05:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
um that are above the the intersection
 
05:17:37.550 --> 05:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
that would be either a camera for each
 
05:17:39.650 --> 05:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
direction or one camera that would look
 
05:17:41.270 --> 05:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
at all approaches
 
05:17:45.310 --> 05:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
so those detection devices will tell the
 
05:17:47.330 --> 05:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
controller that somebody's waiting for
 
05:17:49.310 --> 05:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
the for a phase and typically a traffic
 
05:17:51.830 --> 05:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
signal will rest green on the main
 
05:17:53.628 --> 05:17:53.638 align:start position:0%
Direction so the main Highway would be
 
05:17:55.208 --> 05:17:55.218 align:start position:0%
green if there's no traffic on the road
 
05:17:57.830 --> 05:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
but if somebody's turning left off that
 
05:18:00.708 --> 05:18:00.718 align:start position:0%
road or they're crossing the road they
 
05:18:01.730 --> 05:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:18:03.890 --> 05:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
um detected and then the controller
 
05:18:05.810 --> 05:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
would call that phase in the phase
 
05:18:09.830 --> 05:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
sequence goes into similar cycle
 
05:18:11.270 --> 05:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
um so that's pretty much all of our
 
05:18:13.010 --> 05:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
signals but one thing to note that
 
05:18:14.990 --> 05:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
especially with the inductive Loops that
 
05:18:17.208 --> 05:18:17.218 align:start position:0%
are in the pavement uh if we have a
 
05:18:19.368 --> 05:18:19.378 align:start position:0%
failed inductive Loop that happens this
 
05:18:20.570 --> 05:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
time of year we're probably not going to
 
05:18:22.430 --> 05:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
fix that until sometime in the summer uh
 
05:18:24.288 --> 05:18:24.298 align:start position:0%
just because we can't be cutting into
 
05:18:26.330 --> 05:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
pavement and and doing that kind of work
 
05:18:28.128 --> 05:18:28.138 align:start position:0%
in the winter time
 
05:18:29.510 --> 05:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
um we would probably do a lot of those
 
05:18:31.430 --> 05:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
over the winter and in those cases
 
05:18:33.948 --> 05:18:33.958 align:start position:0%
traffic signals would be set on what we
 
05:18:36.170 --> 05:18:36.180 align:start position:0%
call recall so they would they would
 
05:18:37.970 --> 05:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
tend to run the same cycle every time
 
05:18:39.830 --> 05:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
where the traffic was coming or not so
 
05:18:42.170 --> 05:18:42.180 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of the default case
 
05:18:43.850 --> 05:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
if there's faulty
 
05:18:46.850 --> 05:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
um detection that we can't restore and
 
05:18:48.590 --> 05:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
one of the advantages of cameras other
 
05:18:50.990 --> 05:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
than that the more expensive is that we
 
05:18:53.930 --> 05:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
can fix detection when it fails
 
05:18:53.940 --> 05:18:54.770 align:start position:0%
can fix detection when it fails
um

05:18:54.770 --> 05:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:56.510 --> 05:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
because we can do that kind of work in
 
05:18:57.830 --> 05:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
the winter time
 
05:19:00.530 --> 05:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
so I I did want to mention that in 2009
 
05:19:02.868 --> 05:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
we solicited a Federal Highway to come
 
05:19:05.570 --> 05:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
in and do a traffic signal assessment or
 
05:19:07.730 --> 05:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
audit of our of our process and our
 
05:19:12.650 --> 05:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
resources they give us a plan in 2009
 
05:19:12.660 --> 05:19:13.910 align:start position:0%
resources they give us a plan in 2009
that

05:19:13.910 --> 05:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:19:15.948 --> 05:19:15.958 align:start position:0%
identified some of the I guess lower
 
05:19:17.868 --> 05:19:17.878 align:start position:0%
hanging fruit that opportunities for
 
05:19:20.628 --> 05:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
improvement they did mention that in the
 
05:19:22.010 --> 05:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
10-year plan there's not an active
 
05:19:23.330 --> 05:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
traffic signal operations and
 
05:19:25.490 --> 05:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
maintenance item so we don't have a
 
05:19:27.230 --> 05:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
program Capital project for something
 
05:19:29.930 --> 05:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
like that and I've said over the years
 
05:19:32.750 --> 05:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
that with 400 traffic 50 traffic signals
 
05:19:34.510 --> 05:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
and we typically will
 
05:19:38.270 --> 05:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
estimate that a signal is good for 25 to
 
05:19:40.070 --> 05:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
30 years that if you do the number we
 
05:19:44.090 --> 05:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
should be updating or replacing eight to
 
05:19:45.650 --> 05:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
ten traffic signals a year and we don't
 
05:19:47.208 --> 05:19:47.218 align:start position:0%
come anywhere near that
 
05:19:50.390 --> 05:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
so that was one thing that they noticed
 
05:19:51.708 --> 05:19:51.718 align:start position:0%
they noticed that we had a good
 
05:19:53.330 --> 05:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
foundation and a commitment dedication
 
05:19:56.208 --> 05:19:56.218 align:start position:0%
to staff but Staffing was inadequate
 
05:19:57.770 --> 05:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
we've got the same number of technicians
 
05:20:00.890 --> 05:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
maintaining 450 signals now that we had
 
05:20:03.770 --> 05:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
in the 70s and 80s maintaining less than
 
05:20:05.810 --> 05:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
half of that so they definitely noted
 
05:20:07.190 --> 05:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
that and one of the challenges for the
 
05:20:09.890 --> 05:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
D.O.T is that our traffic signals can
 
05:20:12.708 --> 05:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
often be spread by hours
 
05:20:14.330 --> 05:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
um from one place to the other so the
 
05:20:16.368 --> 05:20:16.378 align:start position:0%
tax technicians working on a traffic
 
05:20:18.830 --> 05:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
signal in Claremont might be called to
 
05:20:21.708 --> 05:20:21.718 align:start position:0%
fix one in Gorham and that's not a short
 
05:20:21.718 --> 05:20:23.628 align:start position:0%
fix one in Gorham and that's not a short
ride

05:20:23.628 --> 05:20:23.638 align:start position:0%
ride
 
05:20:25.550 --> 05:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
um so when they look at numbers of
 
05:20:28.128 --> 05:20:28.138 align:start position:0%
traffic signals per technician in an
 
05:20:29.330 --> 05:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
urban environment it's a little
 
05:20:31.610 --> 05:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
different than it would be for us
 
05:20:33.530 --> 05:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
they determined that the dot was not
 
05:20:35.390 --> 05:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
well positioned to proactively manage
 
05:20:36.948 --> 05:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
signals due to the functional
 
05:20:38.330 --> 05:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
Communications limitations so
 
05:20:40.190 --> 05:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
essentially what they're saying which
 
05:20:42.170 --> 05:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
kind of gets into this bill is that we
 
05:20:45.350 --> 05:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
were not necessarily using the available
 
05:20:48.010 --> 05:20:48.020 align:start position:0%
technology to communicate with from our
 
05:20:50.510 --> 05:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
headquarters to the traffic signals so a
 
05:20:51.708 --> 05:20:51.718 align:start position:0%
lot of times our traffic signal
 
05:20:53.810 --> 05:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
technicians are getting complaints about
 
05:20:56.390 --> 05:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
a call that a Signal's not not cycling
 
05:20:59.330 --> 05:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
properly or the Signal's not functioning
 
05:21:01.190 --> 05:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
we get kind of vague complaints about
 
05:21:03.230 --> 05:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with the signals and we're
 
05:21:05.330 --> 05:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
not able to triage those calls by
 
05:21:07.190 --> 05:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
connecting to the controller remotely to
 
05:21:08.448 --> 05:21:08.458 align:start position:0%
make sure that everything's working all
 
05:21:10.128 --> 05:21:10.138 align:start position:0%
right we typically have to send a
 
05:21:12.110 --> 05:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
technician out to the to the site and
 
05:21:14.570 --> 05:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
and open the cabinet door to do that
 
05:21:16.310 --> 05:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
and then they also noted the primary
 
05:21:18.110 --> 05:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
performance measure was our response to
 
05:21:19.610 --> 05:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
Citizen complaints
 
05:21:21.890 --> 05:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
so we didn't have any proactive
 
05:21:23.448 --> 05:21:23.458 align:start position:0%
performance measures that we had
 
05:21:26.150 --> 05:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
reactive measures
 
05:21:27.650 --> 05:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
um so that that was some of the things
 
05:21:30.230 --> 05:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
that they identified out of that study
 
05:21:32.448 --> 05:21:32.458 align:start position:0%
um since that time
 
05:21:34.788 --> 05:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
we reorganized our traffic signal
 
05:21:36.948 --> 05:21:36.958 align:start position:0%
maintenance operation section so that we
 
05:21:40.128 --> 05:21:40.138 align:start position:0%
were taking more of a we're pending the
 
05:21:42.170 --> 05:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
focus Less on Strictly the maintenance
 
05:21:44.030 --> 05:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
and response and try to be more
 
05:21:45.708 --> 05:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
proactive and look at systems management
 
05:21:47.208 --> 05:21:47.218 align:start position:0%
and operation
 
05:21:49.910 --> 05:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh so we've actually put a fairly senior
 
05:21:51.470 --> 05:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
engineering position on top of our
 
05:21:52.628 --> 05:21:52.638 align:start position:0%
signal group
 
05:21:55.310 --> 05:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
we've developed a reliable inventory so
 
05:21:57.350 --> 05:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
that we know what we have not just the
 
05:21:58.850 --> 05:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
number of signals but what's in the
 
05:21:58.860 --> 05:22:00.650 align:start position:0%
number of signals but what's in the
cabinet

05:22:00.650 --> 05:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
cabinet
 
05:22:02.090 --> 05:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
um we're working on developing
 
05:22:03.830 --> 05:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate and measurable performance
 
05:22:03.840 --> 05:22:05.090 align:start position:0%
appropriate and measurable performance
measures

05:22:05.090 --> 05:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
measures
 
05:22:08.090 --> 05:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
uh and looking for opportunities to use
 
05:22:09.970 --> 05:22:09.980 align:start position:0%
emerging traffic signal technology
 
05:22:12.410 --> 05:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
Technologies particularly those related
 
05:22:14.150 --> 05:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
to detection and Signal efficiency
 
05:22:16.550 --> 05:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
signal system efficiency
 
05:22:19.310 --> 05:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that these
 
05:22:20.570 --> 05:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
signals don't do and a lot of people
 
05:22:21.770 --> 05:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
think that
 
05:22:23.510 --> 05:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
some timing changes will make things
 
05:22:25.070 --> 05:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
work better
 
05:22:26.570 --> 05:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
um but it gets to a point when we have
 
05:22:28.368 --> 05:22:28.378 align:start position:0%
saturated traffic conditions and I know
 
05:22:30.288 --> 05:22:30.298 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes is probably
 
05:22:32.810 --> 05:22:32.820 align:start position:0%
familiar with the exit 18 Corridor in
 
05:22:32.820 --> 05:22:34.250 align:start position:0%
familiar with the exit 18 Corridor in
Lebanon

05:22:34.250 --> 05:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
Lebanon
 
05:22:36.708 --> 05:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
um we've got fairly High volumes of
 
05:22:37.788 --> 05:22:37.798 align:start position:0%
traffic coming from three different
 
05:22:39.410 --> 05:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
directions at the same time in the
 
05:22:39.420 --> 05:22:40.128 align:start position:0%
directions at the same time in the
morning

05:22:40.128 --> 05:22:40.138 align:start position:0%
morning
 
05:22:42.650 --> 05:22:42.660 align:start position:0%
you there's not a lot that adaptive or
 
05:22:44.990 --> 05:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
signal technology can do uh with those
 
05:22:46.730 --> 05:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
things because
 
05:22:48.708 --> 05:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
um signals by definition of creating
 
05:22:50.570 --> 05:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
delay and it's there's only so much they
 
05:22:53.810 --> 05:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:56.150 --> 05:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
um so a couple more points I wanted to
 
05:22:57.890 --> 05:22:57.900 align:start position:0%
make that we do have adaptive signal
 
05:22:59.930 --> 05:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
control in a couple of areas and that
 
05:23:01.970 --> 05:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
exit 18 area in Lebanon is one of those
 
05:23:04.970 --> 05:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
areas so adaptive signal control is
 
05:23:07.550 --> 05:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
essentially a term that means
 
05:23:09.288 --> 05:23:09.298 align:start position:0%
you add additional
 
05:23:09.298 --> 05:23:10.850 align:start position:0%
you add additional
um

05:23:10.850 --> 05:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:12.830 --> 05:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
detection at a signal so you can detect
 
05:23:15.470 --> 05:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
advance of the intersections and then
 
05:23:18.430 --> 05:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
you can the the Adaptive system will
 
05:23:21.650 --> 05:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
adjust the timing and phasing
 
05:23:24.830 --> 05:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
values in real time and not a
 
05:23:27.050 --> 05:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
coordinated system like we've did
 
05:23:29.090 --> 05:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
initially would be where we would do
 
05:23:32.150 --> 05:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
some traffic counts and project an
 
05:23:34.368 --> 05:23:34.378 align:start position:0%
average condition and we would design
 
05:23:37.788 --> 05:23:37.798 align:start position:0%
timings for that average condition
 
05:23:39.050 --> 05:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
um but if there was something happened
 
05:23:41.090 --> 05:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
that was different from that average the
 
05:23:42.948 --> 05:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
signals wouldn't change to adapt to that
 
05:23:45.110 --> 05:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
adapter signals can use real-time
 
05:23:47.628 --> 05:23:47.638 align:start position:0%
traffic volumes and and adjust the
 
05:23:50.208 --> 05:23:50.218 align:start position:0%
phasing and timing to represent those
 
05:23:53.510 --> 05:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
real-time changes to traffic
 
05:23:56.750 --> 05:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
so in that letter I did describe what um
 
05:23:59.390 --> 05:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
the difference between the actuated
 
05:24:01.190 --> 05:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
signal is a coordinated system and
 
05:24:03.410 --> 05:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
adaptive signals
 
05:24:04.910 --> 05:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
um I know that was a three-page
 
05:24:06.830 --> 05:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
testimony and I've probably gone on
 
05:24:08.570 --> 05:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
longer than I should in the in this
 
05:24:11.208 --> 05:24:11.218 align:start position:0%
verbal testimony uh signals can be
 
05:24:12.770 --> 05:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
pretty complicated
 
05:24:14.708 --> 05:24:14.718 align:start position:0%
um I know in a lot of cases where we've
 
05:24:16.910 --> 05:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
optimized traffic signal timing and
 
05:24:18.650 --> 05:24:18.660 align:start position:0%
phasing through a corridor
 
05:24:20.690 --> 05:24:20.700 align:start position:0%
our our technicians get a lot of
 
05:24:22.490 --> 05:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
complaints because what we've done when
 
05:24:25.010 --> 05:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
we try to optimize the throughput along
 
05:24:27.470 --> 05:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
a corridor is we've penalized some of
 
05:24:29.868 --> 05:24:29.878 align:start position:0%
the intersecting side roads
 
05:24:31.788 --> 05:24:31.798 align:start position:0%
um I know I've been in some urban areas
 
05:24:35.750 --> 05:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
and other other states where as a marked
 
05:24:37.310 --> 05:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
difference in how much time people are
 
05:24:39.530 --> 05:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
willing to wait to enter a corridor or
 
05:24:42.230 --> 05:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
to make a lot left turn off Corridor uh
 
05:24:43.670 --> 05:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
I think in a lot of ways we've spoiled
 
05:24:45.470 --> 05:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
traffic to to expect if they've come up
 
05:24:46.850 --> 05:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
to a light and they don't see anybody
 
05:24:47.810 --> 05:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
moving they're going to get a green
 
05:24:49.850 --> 05:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
light right away
 
05:24:52.070 --> 05:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes if it's that one car that
 
05:24:54.770 --> 05:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
that turns that phase you're going to
 
05:24:56.330 --> 05:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
get a minimum time for that phase so
 
05:24:58.310 --> 05:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
you're kind of wasting a phase for one
 
05:24:59.930 --> 05:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
vehicle at a time we'd like to be able
 
05:25:02.150 --> 05:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
to stack more Vehicles than that but
 
05:25:04.430 --> 05:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
people aren't always patient enough to
 
05:25:08.390 --> 05:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
wait for more cars to come behind them
 
05:25:09.770 --> 05:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
um so with that
 
05:25:11.690 --> 05:25:11.700 align:start position:0%
um again signals can be pretty
 
05:25:12.948 --> 05:25:12.958 align:start position:0%
complicated I don't know if I can answer
 
05:25:14.390 --> 05:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
all the questions but I'd be happy to
 
05:25:17.750 --> 05:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:19.850 --> 05:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Lambert uh any questions
 
05:25:24.010 --> 05:25:24.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:27.110 --> 05:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative Hill
 
05:25:29.390 --> 05:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and uh and thank you
 
05:25:32.270 --> 05:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
Mr Lambert for your testimony um
 
05:25:35.270 --> 05:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
you and I have had this conversation
 
05:25:39.410 --> 05:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
um not too long ago about uh the route 3
 
05:25:39.420 --> 05:25:41.530 align:start position:0%
um not too long ago about uh the route 3
uh

05:25:41.530 --> 05:25:41.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:25:44.390 --> 05:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
intersection at exit 20
 
05:25:46.250 --> 05:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
um up in Tilton
 
05:25:49.788 --> 05:25:49.798 align:start position:0%
and you explained it uh clearly to me
 
05:25:49.798 --> 05:25:50.690 align:start position:0%
and you explained it uh clearly to me
then

05:25:50.690 --> 05:25:50.700 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:25:53.270 --> 05:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
um that anytime you get into these
 
05:25:53.280 --> 05:25:55.550 align:start position:0%
um that anytime you get into these
intersection

05:25:55.550 --> 05:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
intersection
 
05:25:55.560 --> 05:25:56.270 align:start position:0%
intersection
um

05:25:56.270 --> 05:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:58.490 --> 05:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
dilemmas there's always a trade-off
 
05:26:00.830 --> 05:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
there's either uh
 
05:26:02.990 --> 05:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
um talking about the side roads you're
 
05:26:06.110 --> 05:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
you're disadvantaging those side roads
 
05:26:09.948 --> 05:26:09.958 align:start position:0%
in order to keep the traffic flowing I
 
05:26:09.958 --> 05:26:11.208 align:start position:0%
in order to keep the traffic flowing I
appreciated

05:26:11.208 --> 05:26:11.218 align:start position:0%
appreciated
 
05:26:14.448 --> 05:26:14.458 align:start position:0%
um your testimony again today and I'm
 
05:26:14.458 --> 05:26:15.410 align:start position:0%
um your testimony again today and I'm
wondering

05:26:15.410 --> 05:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
05:26:19.490 --> 05:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
is it your belief that this legislation
 
05:26:23.330 --> 05:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
um is somehow misguided or should not be
 
05:26:26.990 --> 05:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
taken is that is that what I'm hearing
 
05:26:30.050 --> 05:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
yeah I I didn't want I thank you for the
 
05:26:31.788 --> 05:26:31.798 align:start position:0%
question representative Hill uh I didn't
 
05:26:33.770 --> 05:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
want it to come off as being
 
05:26:36.230 --> 05:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh we certainly support anything that
 
05:26:37.610 --> 05:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
can improve mobility and there's
 
05:26:39.590 --> 05:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
certainly room for improvement in our
 
05:26:41.930 --> 05:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
traffic signal operations
 
05:26:44.030 --> 05:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
um I think the commission uh would be
 
05:26:45.948 --> 05:26:45.958 align:start position:0%
valuable if for nothing else than to
 
05:26:45.958 --> 05:26:46.610 align:start position:0%
valuable if for nothing else than to
give

05:26:46.610 --> 05:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
give
 
05:26:50.390 --> 05:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh I think the folks in the committee uh
 
05:26:53.270 --> 05:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
in the legislature an idea of what we
 
05:26:55.490 --> 05:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
have done and what things we'd like to
 
05:26:55.500 --> 05:26:56.390 align:start position:0%
have done and what things we'd like to
do

05:26:56.390 --> 05:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:26:58.430 --> 05:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
um and what that might cost moving
 
05:26:59.810 --> 05:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
forward so I think it would be a good
 
05:27:01.610 --> 05:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
idea a good way
 
05:27:03.410 --> 05:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh first of all I think we could share
 
05:27:05.810 --> 05:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
the assessment that we had done in 2009
 
05:27:08.030 --> 05:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
so you could see 10 years ago what we
 
05:27:09.708 --> 05:27:09.718 align:start position:0%
were looking to do
 
05:27:12.590 --> 05:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
um as a place to start and then and move
 
05:27:14.868 --> 05:27:14.878 align:start position:0%
on from there it is a lot of work uh I
 
05:27:17.150 --> 05:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
agree with the comment that to that the
 
05:27:19.910 --> 05:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
August 2021 might be pretty short but I
 
05:27:22.610 --> 05:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
think we could probably Identify some of
 
05:27:26.448 --> 05:27:26.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:29.390 --> 05:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much
 
05:27:31.730 --> 05:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski
 
05:27:33.890 --> 05:27:33.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thank you
 
05:27:36.410 --> 05:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
Mr Lambert for your testimony
 
05:27:40.250 --> 05:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
um in regards to this commission if they
 
05:27:42.410 --> 05:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
come up with a report
 
05:27:44.750 --> 05:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
and make some recommendations and I
 
05:27:47.628 --> 05:27:47.638 align:start position:0%
understand it really depends
 
05:27:50.448 --> 05:27:50.458 align:start position:0%
on the technology on that on what
 
05:27:51.708 --> 05:27:51.718 align:start position:0%
they're Rec what what they're
 
05:27:51.718 --> 05:27:53.090 align:start position:0%
they're Rec what what they're
recommending

05:27:53.090 --> 05:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
recommending
 
05:27:55.250 --> 05:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
can you give a sub like a ballpark on
 
05:27:58.610 --> 05:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
like how long it would take to implement
 
05:28:03.050 --> 05:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:03.060 --> 05:28:04.730 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:28:04.730 --> 05:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:06.590 --> 05:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard to say without knowing
 
05:28:08.448 --> 05:28:08.458 align:start position:0%
what the recommendations are but I'll
 
05:28:10.670 --> 05:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
use that assessment and again thank you
 
05:28:11.750 --> 05:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
05:28:13.490 --> 05:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
I'll use the assessment that we had done
 
05:28:14.990 --> 05:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
in 2009
 
05:28:17.030 --> 05:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things that they pointed out
 
05:28:19.128 --> 05:28:19.138 align:start position:0%
is that we we may not have been taking
 
05:28:22.128 --> 05:28:22.138 align:start position:0%
advantage of all the alternative funding
 
05:28:23.750 --> 05:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
and Manpower resources that were
 
05:28:26.690 --> 05:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
available so they were recommending that
 
05:28:29.510 --> 05:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
we look into
 
05:28:29.520 --> 05:28:30.470 align:start position:0%
we look into
um

05:28:30.470 --> 05:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:32.690 --> 05:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
Mutual uh funding with some of the
 
05:28:34.610 --> 05:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
municipalities and places where where
 
05:28:37.970 --> 05:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
our coordinated systems overlap
 
05:28:40.430 --> 05:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
um so we were able to do that kind of
 
05:28:40.440 --> 05:28:41.390 align:start position:0%
um so we were able to do that kind of
thing

05:28:41.390 --> 05:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:28:41.400 --> 05:28:42.470 align:start position:0%
thing
um

05:28:42.470 --> 05:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:44.750 --> 05:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly we identified certainly
 
05:28:46.910 --> 05:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
the the obvious choices like the
 
05:28:49.070 --> 05:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester Nashua
 
05:28:51.288 --> 05:28:51.298 align:start position:0%
um and some of the places where the
 
05:28:54.470 --> 05:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
local interest in coordinating signals
 
05:28:57.850 --> 05:28:57.860 align:start position:0%
so a state interchange were pretty high
 
05:29:00.948 --> 05:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
but we also use that as a reason for
 
05:29:04.310 --> 05:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
starting our annual Workshop where we
 
05:29:04.320 --> 05:29:04.970 align:start position:0%
starting our annual Workshop where we
did

05:29:04.970 --> 05:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
did
 
05:29:07.128 --> 05:29:07.138 align:start position:0%
we hosted a workshop where it was
 
05:29:09.170 --> 05:29:09.180 align:start position:0%
essentially allowing the municipalities
 
05:29:11.930 --> 05:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
and the state DOT traffic signal folks
 
05:29:14.990 --> 05:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
to share some best practices
 
05:29:16.310 --> 05:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
and that was one of the things we got
 
05:29:18.170 --> 05:29:18.180 align:start position:0%
out of that assessment so some of those
 
05:29:19.490 --> 05:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
things are pretty easy to implement
 
05:29:20.810 --> 05:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
because there's not a lot of cost to
 
05:29:20.820 --> 05:29:21.530 align:start position:0%
because there's not a lot of cost to
them

05:29:21.530 --> 05:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:29:24.230 --> 05:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh it's when you start looking at
 
05:29:27.190 --> 05:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
um maybe adding adaptive signals where
 
05:29:29.510 --> 05:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to mean putting more
 
05:29:32.090 --> 05:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
advanced detection could be as much as a
 
05:29:34.070 --> 05:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
hundred uh or several hundred thousand
 
05:29:35.570 --> 05:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
depending on how complicated the
 
05:29:36.708 --> 05:29:36.718 align:start position:0%
corridor is
 
05:29:38.330 --> 05:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
that would end up having to be in a
 
05:29:40.970 --> 05:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
budget process and maybe even um some
 
05:29:42.350 --> 05:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
dedicated funding through the capital
 
05:29:46.430 --> 05:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:48.288 --> 05:29:48.298 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr Lambert
 
05:29:50.510 --> 05:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
good thing
 
05:29:52.430 --> 05:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
I don't see any other questions from the
 
05:29:52.440 --> 05:29:54.288 align:start position:0%
I don't see any other questions from the
committee

05:29:54.288 --> 05:29:54.298 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:29:56.288 --> 05:29:56.298 align:start position:0%
well there are one more representative
 
05:29:58.490 --> 05:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:30:01.190 --> 05:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
um and thank you Mr Lambert
 
05:30:04.250 --> 05:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
um this assessment from 2009 was that
 
05:30:06.170 --> 05:30:06.180 align:start position:0%
another study commission or was that an
 
05:30:09.948 --> 05:30:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:11.628 --> 05:30:11.638 align:start position:0%
that was in thank you for the question
 
05:30:13.610 --> 05:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
that was an internal assessment that we
 
05:30:15.470 --> 05:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
requested through Federal Highway their
 
05:30:17.868 --> 05:30:17.878 align:start position:0%
Resource Center had an opportunity for
 
05:30:19.788 --> 05:30:19.798 align:start position:0%
us to have a I guess an independent
 
05:30:22.490 --> 05:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
auditor assessment of our program and it
 
05:30:24.890 --> 05:30:24.900 align:start position:0%
came at a time when we
 
05:30:24.900 --> 05:30:25.490 align:start position:0%
came at a time when we
um

05:30:25.490 --> 05:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:29.208 --> 05:30:29.218 align:start position:0%
from the 1980s to the 1970s I think
 
05:30:33.110 --> 05:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
until the late 90s even into the 2000s
 
05:30:35.750 --> 05:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
we had two different people that were
 
05:30:37.330 --> 05:30:37.340 align:start position:0%
responsible for our traffic signal
 
05:30:40.788 --> 05:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
operation uh with a lot of experience in
 
05:30:44.208 --> 05:30:44.218 align:start position:0%
in that 2007-8 time period uh the second
 
05:30:46.850 --> 05:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
of those people retired so that we were
 
05:30:48.288 --> 05:30:48.298 align:start position:0%
we were kind of starting from scratch
 
05:30:51.170 --> 05:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
and looking for kind of a baseline of
 
05:30:53.390 --> 05:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
where we are and where we want to be so
 
05:30:55.128 --> 05:30:55.138 align:start position:0%
we had we had reached out to Federal
 
05:30:56.770 --> 05:30:56.780 align:start position:0%
Highway they had the resource available
 
05:30:59.690 --> 05:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
uh and they did a fairly comprehensive
 
05:31:01.730 --> 05:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
assessment uh with some of their subject
 
05:31:04.310 --> 05:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
matter experts and I can make that
 
05:31:08.868 --> 05:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:11.330 --> 05:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
good thank you
 
05:31:13.490 --> 05:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
no other questions thank you very much
 
05:31:14.690 --> 05:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
Mr Lambert
 
05:31:16.610 --> 05:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
thank you have a nice day good to see
 
05:31:19.430 --> 05:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:19.440 --> 05:31:20.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:31:20.510 --> 05:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:31:22.368 --> 05:31:22.378 align:start position:0%
um that's all I have for
 
05:31:22.378 --> 05:31:24.110 align:start position:0%
um that's all I have for
uh

05:31:24.110 --> 05:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:31:26.208 --> 05:31:26.218 align:start position:0%
they have signed up
 
05:31:26.218 --> 05:31:26.770 align:start position:0%
they have signed up
um

05:31:26.770 --> 05:31:26.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:30.350 --> 05:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
any last-minute arrivals for anybody
 
05:31:31.670 --> 05:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
else that would like wish to speak on
 
05:31:35.570 --> 05:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:38.150 --> 05:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
there is another one sorry

Hampshire
 
05:32:02.150 --> 05:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
we're an association of about 75
 
05:32:04.850 --> 05:32:04.860 align:start position:0%
engineering and related firms
 
05:32:07.430 --> 05:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
they employ over 1500 New Hampshire
 
05:32:09.470 --> 05:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
residents and they're engaged in a wide
 
05:32:12.170 --> 05:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
range of public and private engineering
 
05:32:12.180 --> 05:32:13.610 align:start position:0%
range of public and private engineering
works

05:32:13.610 --> 05:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
works
 
05:32:15.350 --> 05:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
Professional Engineers from New
 
05:32:17.270 --> 05:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consulting firms are often
 
05:32:19.368 --> 05:32:19.378 align:start position:0%
hired by both state and local
 
05:32:21.470 --> 05:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
governments to perform traffic
 
05:32:23.628 --> 05:32:23.638 align:start position:0%
Engineering Services
 
05:32:25.970 --> 05:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
we are speaking today to request an
 
05:32:27.948 --> 05:32:27.958 align:start position:0%
amendment to the legislation
 
05:32:30.410 --> 05:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
the bill as introduced does not mandate
 
05:32:33.050 --> 05:32:33.060 align:start position:0%
a civil or traffic engineer be a part of
 
05:32:34.490 --> 05:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
the study
 
05:32:36.650 --> 05:32:36.660 align:start position:0%
our simple request is to add a
 
05:32:38.570 --> 05:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
professional engineer from our
 
05:32:41.208 --> 05:32:41.218 align:start position:0%
association to the commission we feel
 
05:32:42.948 --> 05:32:42.958 align:start position:0%
it's important that the bill be clear
 
05:32:45.830 --> 05:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
that a private sector engineer who very
 
05:32:48.050 --> 05:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
often is performing these Services under
 
05:32:49.730 --> 05:32:49.740 align:start position:0%
contract by state and local government
 
05:32:52.190 --> 05:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
be a part of the study
 
05:32:53.750 --> 05:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
05:32:55.910 --> 05:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
we would ask that you consider adding a
 
05:32:57.170 --> 05:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
representative from the New Hampshire
 
05:32:59.448 --> 05:32:59.458 align:start position:0%
Public Works Association or the New
 
05:33:01.970 --> 05:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association as you
 
05:33:03.948 --> 05:33:03.958 align:start position:0%
know much of the traffic engineering and
 
05:33:05.990 --> 05:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
other relevant issues are discussed and
 
05:33:09.050 --> 05:33:09.060 align:start position:0%
performed at the city and town level
 
05:33:10.970 --> 05:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
and we feel that their perspective on
 
05:33:13.070 --> 05:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
this issue would be valuable to the
 
05:33:15.170 --> 05:33:15.180 align:start position:0%
commission's mission
 
05:33:16.970 --> 05:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
so that's all I have Mr chairman I
 
05:33:19.850 --> 05:33:19.860 align:start position:0%
appreciate your consideration and if I
 
05:33:21.350 --> 05:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
can answer any questions I'd be happy to
 
05:33:22.990 --> 05:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
do so
 
05:33:23.000 --> 05:33:30.948 align:start position:0%
do so

in terms of the blue sheets we have uh
 
05:33:45.890 --> 05:33:45.900 align:start position:0%
two other people that signed up and
 
05:33:50.410 --> 05:33:50.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:53.030 --> 05:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
member of the public also supports this
 
05:33:54.890 --> 05:33:54.900 align:start position:0%
kind of with that we're going to close
 
05:33:58.190 --> 05:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on household 423
 
05:34:00.530 --> 05:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
to give our clerk a couple of minutes to
 
05:34:05.990 --> 05:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:39.230 --> 05:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:39.240 --> 05:34:50.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:34:50.110 --> 05:34:50.120 align:start position:0%

House Bill 424 an act establishing a
 
05:36:05.990 --> 05:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee to study ways to reduce
 
05:36:07.970 --> 05:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
texting while driving
 
05:36:07.980 --> 05:36:09.770 align:start position:0%
texting while driving
representative

05:36:09.770 --> 05:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:36:11.090 --> 05:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
welcome again
 
05:36:13.670 --> 05:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
I'm still here
 
05:36:15.530 --> 05:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chair and members of
 
05:36:17.510 --> 05:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
the transportation committee
 
05:36:19.368 --> 05:36:19.378 align:start position:0%
uh once again for the record my name is
 
05:36:22.310 --> 05:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
Peter Trojan I represent the Rockingham
 
05:36:25.670 --> 05:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
County district 14 towns of Atkinson and
 
05:36:25.680 --> 05:36:28.430 align:start position:0%
County district 14 towns of Atkinson and
Plaistow

05:36:28.430 --> 05:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:31.730 --> 05:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
I'm here on this one again to
 
05:36:34.670 --> 05:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
um ask for your support on House Bill
 
05:36:34.680 --> 05:36:36.288 align:start position:0%
um ask for your support on House Bill
424

05:36:36.288 --> 05:36:36.298 align:start position:0%
424
 
05:36:38.150 --> 05:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
establishment a commission to study ways
 
05:36:40.850 --> 05:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
to reduce texting while driving
 
05:36:43.430 --> 05:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
this is another bill that was passed by
 
05:36:47.930 --> 05:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
both bodies last year and got
 
05:36:49.490 --> 05:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
kind of shoveled on the table because
 
05:36:51.770 --> 05:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
all of what's going on
 
05:36:54.170 --> 05:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
I think it's still needed nothing's
 
05:36:55.550 --> 05:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
changed since then so I'm back again
 
05:36:57.590 --> 05:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
asking you to uh
 
05:36:57.600 --> 05:36:59.750 align:start position:0%
asking you to uh
yeah

05:36:59.750 --> 05:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:36:59.760 --> 05:37:01.070 align:start position:0%
yeah
hopefully

05:37:01.070 --> 05:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
05:37:05.810 --> 05:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:08.090 --> 05:37:08.100 align:start position:0%
again I'll tell you the reason why this
 
05:37:10.970 --> 05:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
is a commission instead of
 
05:37:10.980 --> 05:37:12.288 align:start position:0%
is a commission instead of
bill

05:37:12.288 --> 05:37:12.298 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:37:14.750 --> 05:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
or instead of a you know something that
 
05:37:17.628 --> 05:37:17.638 align:start position:0%
creates either fines or fees or taking
 
05:37:19.490 --> 05:37:19.500 align:start position:0%
somebody's license away because we've
 
05:37:21.590 --> 05:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
had a bunch of those over the years
 
05:37:23.330 --> 05:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
and they don't seem to work
 
05:37:25.430 --> 05:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know about any of you at all but
 
05:37:29.330 --> 05:37:29.340 align:start position:0%
when I drove up today this morning to go
 
05:37:31.970 --> 05:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
to my committee for hearings
 
05:37:34.070 --> 05:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
I lost count on the number of people I
 
05:37:36.708 --> 05:37:36.718 align:start position:0%
saw texting on the highway and for that
 
05:37:38.628 --> 05:37:38.638 align:start position:0%
matter the back roads it's a problem
 
05:37:42.288 --> 05:37:42.298 align:start position:0%
it's a safety issue and as you may have
 
05:37:44.030 --> 05:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
gathered from my last testimony I
 
05:37:46.128 --> 05:37:46.138 align:start position:0%
believe in
 
05:37:48.110 --> 05:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
creating efficiencies in our traffic
 
05:37:50.090 --> 05:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
flow where we can and this is another
 
05:37:51.830 --> 05:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
place in addition to the safety issues
 
05:37:54.590 --> 05:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
you have
 
05:37:57.110 --> 05:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
except before a light behind somebody
 
05:37:58.610 --> 05:37:58.620 align:start position:0%
that was at the beginning of the line
 
05:38:01.128 --> 05:38:01.138 align:start position:0%
that had to finish that text before they
 
05:38:04.010 --> 05:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
uh they could move on so it's an
 
05:38:05.810 --> 05:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
inconvenience it's also
 
05:38:07.850 --> 05:38:07.860 align:start position:0%
um for its efficiency and I would argue
 
05:38:11.090 --> 05:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
with also adds to more missions you know
 
05:38:12.410 --> 05:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
vehicle emissions than there may be
 
05:38:12.420 --> 05:38:13.550 align:start position:0%
vehicle emissions than there may be
otherwise

05:38:13.550 --> 05:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
05:38:14.990 --> 05:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
and again the reason why it's a
 
05:38:15.948 --> 05:38:15.958 align:start position:0%
commission is
 
05:38:17.868 --> 05:38:17.878 align:start position:0%
quite simply this bill attempts to bring
 
05:38:19.970 --> 05:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
the interested parties
 
05:38:22.190 --> 05:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
to the table to solve the ongoing
 
05:38:23.930 --> 05:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
problem I don't think you can do it with
 
05:38:25.550 --> 05:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement because we've done that and
 
05:38:27.190 --> 05:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
it didn't seem to make it any better
 
05:38:30.830 --> 05:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
maybe the loss
 
05:38:33.350 --> 05:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
bill that made it illegal legal in New
 
05:38:34.910 --> 05:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the beginning maybe helped
 
05:38:37.430 --> 05:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit but the numbers have seem
 
05:38:39.770 --> 05:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
to come back up and I heard from law
 
05:38:42.110 --> 05:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement supporting that
 
05:38:42.120 --> 05:38:44.628 align:start position:0%
enforcement supporting that
fact

05:38:44.628 --> 05:38:44.638 align:start position:0%
fact
 
05:38:47.330 --> 05:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
so I believe we this is another place we
 
05:38:49.368 --> 05:38:49.378 align:start position:0%
need to use the technology to solve the
 
05:38:49.378 --> 05:38:50.510 align:start position:0%
need to use the technology to solve the
problem

05:38:50.510 --> 05:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:38:52.430 --> 05:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
there are devices that commercial
 
05:38:54.708 --> 05:38:54.718 align:start position:0%
Trucking uses there's one called a
 
05:38:55.788 --> 05:38:55.798 align:start position:0%
vector that
 
05:38:57.948 --> 05:38:57.958 align:start position:0%
it just simply disables your mobile
 
05:39:01.430 --> 05:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
device while the vehicle's in motion
 
05:39:03.288 --> 05:39:03.298 align:start position:0%
I don't know that that would work
 
05:39:04.850 --> 05:39:04.860 align:start position:0%
completely for a passenger vehicle
 
05:39:06.770 --> 05:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
because it may and it may disable
 
05:39:09.890 --> 05:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
everybody's device and passengers that
 
05:39:12.050 --> 05:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
I'm driving certainly uh shouldn't be
 
05:39:14.810 --> 05:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
impacted um and would be probably upset
 
05:39:17.650 --> 05:39:17.660 align:start position:0%
about it so this bill
 
05:39:21.050 --> 05:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
attempts to get a commission together
 
05:39:23.448 --> 05:39:23.458 align:start position:0%
members of law enforcement
 
05:39:27.050 --> 05:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
I was the Senate members of the uh
 
05:39:27.060 --> 05:39:28.550 align:start position:0%
I was the Senate members of the uh
industry

05:39:28.550 --> 05:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
industry
 
05:39:31.970 --> 05:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
both technology and automobile to come
 
05:39:34.550 --> 05:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
up with a solution I I believe if we put
 
05:39:36.288 --> 05:39:36.298 align:start position:0%
our heads together we can we can solve
 
05:39:37.490 --> 05:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
the problem at least make it more
 
05:39:37.500 --> 05:39:38.448 align:start position:0%
the problem at least make it more
manageable

05:39:38.448 --> 05:39:38.458 align:start position:0%
manageable
 
05:39:38.458 --> 05:39:39.708 align:start position:0%
manageable
so

05:39:39.708 --> 05:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:39:41.930 --> 05:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
that is the reason for the
 
05:39:43.910 --> 05:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
for the bill I hope you support it and
 
05:39:45.830 --> 05:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take any questions the
 
05:39:49.128 --> 05:39:49.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:51.110 --> 05:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Rosen you did
 
05:39:52.970 --> 05:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
say this one did pass last year I forget
 
05:39:54.470 --> 05:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
yeah this one did as well they both did
 
05:39:56.628 --> 05:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
well I've got both notes off the one
 
05:40:00.288 --> 05:40:00.298 align:start position:0%
before also yes okay thank you uh any
 
05:40:03.050 --> 05:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:40:04.970 --> 05:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron
 
05:40:08.090 --> 05:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair
 
05:40:13.310 --> 05:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
so I am curious to know why this would
 
05:40:15.470 --> 05:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
have to be some sort of statutory
 
05:40:15.480 --> 05:40:16.970 align:start position:0%
have to be some sort of statutory
Commission

05:40:16.970 --> 05:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
05:40:19.670 --> 05:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't it be better for say
 
05:40:22.128 --> 05:40:22.138 align:start position:0%
the Department of Public Safety to have
 
05:40:26.270 --> 05:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
some kind of Symposium or have you know
 
05:40:29.090 --> 05:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
a conference of some sort to bring
 
05:40:31.310 --> 05:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
parties together to discuss
 
05:40:33.350 --> 05:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
ways in which
 
05:40:36.650 --> 05:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
uh this problem could be a you know
 
05:40:39.110 --> 05:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
tackle maybe they can do a public
 
05:40:39.120 --> 05:40:40.850 align:start position:0%
tackle maybe they can do a public
education

05:40:40.850 --> 05:40:40.860 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:40:44.448 --> 05:40:44.458 align:start position:0%
uh you know advertising campaign or
 
05:40:46.310 --> 05:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
something like that I don't see that
 
05:40:47.208 --> 05:40:47.218 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:40:51.650 --> 05:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
legislative kind of thing to do
 
05:40:55.788 --> 05:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
okay I'll be glad to answer that
 
05:40:57.708 --> 05:40:57.718 align:start position:0%
kind of question this is more of a
 
05:40:59.690 --> 05:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
statement representative and I'll answer
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
it this way
 
05:41:02.868 --> 05:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
um I would certainly welcome that but
 
05:41:05.868 --> 05:41:05.878 align:start position:0%
the reality is uh since texting has
 
05:41:07.670 --> 05:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
become a problem
 
05:41:11.270 --> 05:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
it hasn't happened and so I think
 
05:41:14.030 --> 05:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
well I just plagiar certainly has the
 
05:41:15.708 --> 05:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
responsibility to look at safety issues
 
05:41:18.288 --> 05:41:18.298 align:start position:0%
I think this you know it would be
 
05:41:20.448 --> 05:41:20.458 align:start position:0%
beneficial to solve the problem in my
 
05:41:23.750 --> 05:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
opinion that's why I'm before you today
 
05:41:25.070 --> 05:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
um could it be done another way it
 
05:41:26.750 --> 05:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps it could
 
05:41:26.760 --> 05:41:27.470 align:start position:0%
perhaps it could
um

05:41:27.470 --> 05:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:29.990 --> 05:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes it takes something more
 
05:41:32.810 --> 05:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
organized to to get the
 
05:41:35.510 --> 05:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
get the ball rolling and so uh you know
 
05:41:38.448 --> 05:41:38.458 align:start position:0%
if you could come into a way to make
 
05:41:40.010 --> 05:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
that happen without a commission that
 
05:41:41.510 --> 05:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
would be great
 
05:41:44.570 --> 05:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
um I think it's one of those you know uh
 
05:41:46.850 --> 05:41:46.860 align:start position:0%
elephants in the room people don't like
 
05:41:48.890 --> 05:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
to talk about the problem the texture
 
05:41:50.930 --> 05:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
presents because everybody likes to
 
05:41:53.390 --> 05:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
everybody likes their devices and they
 
05:41:56.030 --> 05:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
like in one hand they acknowledge it's a
 
05:41:57.288 --> 05:41:57.298 align:start position:0%
safety issue they acknowledge it's an
 
05:41:58.490 --> 05:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
inconvenience when you're stuck behind
 
05:41:59.990 --> 05:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
somebody you can see it when you're on
 
05:42:02.628 --> 05:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
the road in somebody's going really slow
 
05:42:04.010 --> 05:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
then they speed up when they're done
 
05:42:07.430 --> 05:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
texting and then they slow down again so
 
05:42:09.050 --> 05:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:42:11.750 --> 05:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'm open to any and every way to solve
 
05:42:14.690 --> 05:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
the problem I I I said in the onset I
 
05:42:17.750 --> 05:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
don't think the the uh we've had again
 
05:42:19.850 --> 05:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
bills to increase the fines and after
 
05:42:21.650 --> 05:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
three strikes and you're out you lose
 
05:42:23.690 --> 05:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
your license kind of thing
 
05:42:25.610 --> 05:42:25.620 align:start position:0%
this is an addictive behavior as far as
 
05:42:28.190 --> 05:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
I can tell and so you have to find a way
 
05:42:29.810 --> 05:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
through technology to solve the problem
 
05:42:32.810 --> 05:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
that's that's why I'm here with this
 
05:42:32.820 --> 05:42:36.530 align:start position:0%
that's that's why I'm here with this
mission

05:42:36.530 --> 05:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:36.540 --> 05:42:37.970 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:42:37.970 --> 05:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:42:37.980 --> 05:42:42.010 align:start position:0%
okay
um

05:42:42.010 --> 05:42:42.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:44.090 --> 05:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions from the
 
05:42:46.010 --> 05:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
committee do we I do have another person
 
05:42:47.270 --> 05:42:47.280 align:start position:0%

Dan Goodman from AAA
 
05:43:03.350 --> 05:43:03.360 align:start position:0%

thank you very much chairman Walsh
 
05:43:11.930 --> 05:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
um and thank you members of the
 
05:43:14.390 --> 05:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
committee for giving me a few minutes
 
05:43:16.190 --> 05:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
um today uh for the record my name is
 
05:43:17.990 --> 05:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
Dan Goodman and I am the manager of
 
05:43:19.448 --> 05:43:19.458 align:start position:0%
public affairs for AAA Northern England
 
05:43:22.550 --> 05:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
and for those who don't know AAA is an
 
05:43:24.170 --> 05:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
auto club membership organization of
 
05:43:26.510 --> 05:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
over 100 million members in Maine New
 
05:43:28.788 --> 05:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Vermont and we actively
 
05:43:30.470 --> 05:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
advocate for public policy that makes
 
05:43:32.448 --> 05:43:32.458 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire a safer place to live work
 
05:43:34.368 --> 05:43:34.378 align:start position:0%
and raise our families
 
05:43:36.590 --> 05:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm here in support of this bill
 
05:43:38.390 --> 05:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
um I sent my written testimony last
 
05:43:40.490 --> 05:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
night so I'll be extremely brief I just
 
05:43:42.530 --> 05:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
wanted to touch on a few points
 
05:43:45.890 --> 05:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
this is an extremely timely bill
 
05:43:47.868 --> 05:43:47.878 align:start position:0%
um as traffic deaths in New Hampshire
 
05:43:50.690 --> 05:43:50.700 align:start position:0%
have increased over the last over the
 
05:43:53.570 --> 05:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
last year over throughout the pandemic
 
05:43:56.090 --> 05:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
despite fewer drivers on the road law
 
05:43:57.770 --> 05:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
enforcement is saying distracted driving
 
05:44:00.110 --> 05:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
is playing an increasing factor in a lot
 
05:44:01.850 --> 05:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
of these deaths
 
05:44:04.070 --> 05:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
um and we have done just a ton a ton of
 
05:44:05.690 --> 05:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
research on this topic
 
05:44:08.690 --> 05:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
and over the last eight to ten years and
 
05:44:11.150 --> 05:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
to quickly speak on all that research
 
05:44:13.310 --> 05:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
probably a dozen studies
 
05:44:15.170 --> 05:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
you know any cell phone use behind the
 
05:44:16.430 --> 05:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
wheel is extremely dangerous and
 
05:44:18.170 --> 05:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
actually quadruple is your crash risks
 
05:44:21.288 --> 05:44:21.298 align:start position:0%
and texting as this bill wants to talk
 
05:44:24.288 --> 05:44:24.298 align:start position:0%
about increase your crash risk 23 23
 
05:44:26.570 --> 05:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
times worse than driving while not
 
05:44:29.690 --> 05:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
distracted and we also produce an annual
 
05:44:32.448 --> 05:44:32.458 align:start position:0%
survey across the country and
 
05:44:34.548 --> 05:44:34.558 align:start position:0%
consistently about 80 to 85 percent of
 
05:44:36.350 --> 05:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
drivers say distraction is just a
 
05:44:38.628 --> 05:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
serious serious issue that we need to
 
05:44:39.770 --> 05:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
05:44:42.048 --> 05:44:42.058 align:start position:0%
um and so really just to conclude is
 
05:44:43.850 --> 05:44:43.860 align:start position:0%
representative torosion said I think
 
05:44:45.048 --> 05:44:45.058 align:start position:0%
it's really important that we need to
 
05:44:47.090 --> 05:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
look at every opportunity to reduce
 
05:44:49.070 --> 05:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
distracted driving and to make New
 
05:44:51.890 --> 05:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire roads a safer to make as safe
 
05:44:53.448 --> 05:44:53.458 align:start position:0%
as possible and I hope you'll support
 
05:44:56.208 --> 05:44:56.218 align:start position:0%
this bill and um that's that's it and
 
05:44:57.590 --> 05:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm happy to answer any
 
05:44:57.600 --> 05:45:04.570 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm happy to answer any
questions

05:45:04.570 --> 05:45:04.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:07.670 --> 05:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you Mr
 
05:45:10.730 --> 05:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
Goodman um
 
05:45:14.090 --> 05:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
my my question is
 
05:45:14.100 --> 05:45:14.690 align:start position:0%
my my question is
um

05:45:14.690 --> 05:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:17.448 --> 05:45:17.458 align:start position:0%
about kind of like the status quo and
 
05:45:19.970 --> 05:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
and what might be hope to be achieved by
 
05:45:21.770 --> 05:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
this you mentioned that there are
 
05:45:23.690 --> 05:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
numerous other studies and research done
 
05:45:26.350 --> 05:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
into this can you cite any other
 
05:45:28.730 --> 05:45:28.740 align:start position:0%
advancements or anything any other
 
05:45:30.650 --> 05:45:30.660 align:start position:0%
examples that other states or anybody
 
05:45:33.230 --> 05:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
else has done to I don't know clamp down
 
05:45:35.530 --> 05:45:35.540 align:start position:0%
on this more or whatever
 
05:45:39.590 --> 05:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:41.390 --> 05:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for that
 
05:45:41.400 --> 05:45:42.470 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for that
question

05:45:42.470 --> 05:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:45:44.868 --> 05:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
um I think for a more thoughtful answer
 
05:45:46.850 --> 05:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
um if you wouldn't mind I'd be happy to
 
05:45:48.110 --> 05:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
05:45:50.570 --> 05:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
dive into that and kind of come up with
 
05:45:52.970 --> 05:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
what other states are doing and I think
 
05:45:55.490 --> 05:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
what representative torosion talked
 
05:45:57.048 --> 05:45:57.058 align:start position:0%
about you know a lot of states are doing
 
05:45:59.510 --> 05:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know increased fines
 
05:46:00.770 --> 05:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of
 
05:46:03.890 --> 05:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
public service announcements PSAs New
 
05:46:05.448 --> 05:46:05.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does a great great job their
 
05:46:07.788 --> 05:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
office of Highway Safety on producing
 
05:46:11.030 --> 05:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
PSAs and educational components
 
05:46:13.670 --> 05:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
um there's a there's annual conferences
 
05:46:15.410 --> 05:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
and there's
 
05:46:16.610 --> 05:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
um you know New Hampshire has the
 
05:46:18.230 --> 05:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
traffic safety commission that I sit on
 
05:46:19.910 --> 05:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
a governor appointed Traffic Safety
 
05:46:22.310 --> 05:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
commission and we regularly meet about
 
05:46:25.128 --> 05:46:25.138 align:start position:0%
distracted driving and figuring out it's
 
05:46:26.208 --> 05:46:26.218 align:start position:0%
a collaborative private public
 
05:46:27.890 --> 05:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
partnership throughout throughout the
 
05:46:29.510 --> 05:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
state trying to figure out ways that we
 
05:46:31.910 --> 05:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
can tackle distracted driving among the
 
05:46:33.948 --> 05:46:33.958 align:start position:0%
other issues
 
05:46:37.010 --> 05:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
um so there are a lot of different ways
 
05:46:38.628 --> 05:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
to go about this I think a commission is
 
05:46:40.070 --> 05:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
a great idea to bring more people
 
05:46:40.080 --> 05:46:41.448 align:start position:0%
a great idea to bring more people
together

05:46:41.448 --> 05:46:41.458 align:start position:0%
together
 
05:46:43.610 --> 05:46:43.620 align:start position:0%
um but I think long and short of it is
 
05:46:45.770 --> 05:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
I'm not really familiar
 
05:46:48.590 --> 05:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
of some very successful ways to reduce
 
05:46:50.090 --> 05:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
distracting driving off top of my head
 
05:46:51.590 --> 05:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
from other states but I'd be happy to
 
05:46:53.570 --> 05:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
look into it
 
05:46:55.788 --> 05:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
05:47:00.890 --> 05:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:03.830 --> 05:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative polarski
 
05:47:05.410 --> 05:47:05.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:47:07.368 --> 05:47:07.378 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Mr
 
05:47:10.250 --> 05:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
Goodman I'm looking at the membership of
 
05:47:12.288 --> 05:47:12.298 align:start position:0%
the commission and other than five
 
05:47:12.298 --> 05:47:13.670 align:start position:0%
the commission and other than five
legislators

05:47:13.670 --> 05:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
05:47:15.708 --> 05:47:15.718 align:start position:0%
we have a designee from the Department
 
05:47:18.350 --> 05:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
of Transportation a designee of the
 
05:47:20.150 --> 05:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and then a
 
05:47:21.650 --> 05:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative that of the
 
05:47:24.350 --> 05:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications industry would you
 
05:47:26.690 --> 05:47:26.700 align:start position:0%
like to see another
 
05:47:29.510 --> 05:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
um member perhaps from an organization
 
05:47:31.548 --> 05:47:31.558 align:start position:0%
similar to yours or can you recommend
 
05:47:34.730 --> 05:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
someone else who is maybe
 
05:47:34.740 --> 05:47:35.750 align:start position:0%
someone else who is maybe
um

05:47:35.750 --> 05:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:39.650 --> 05:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
more fluent in the the data the studies
 
05:47:41.208 --> 05:47:41.218 align:start position:0%
I just I'm just wondering if the
 
05:47:42.890 --> 05:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
membership is is
 
05:47:45.170 --> 05:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
a little Limited
 
05:47:46.910 --> 05:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for that
 
05:47:49.548 --> 05:47:49.558 align:start position:0%
question uh I I you know I I think AAA
 
05:47:52.128 --> 05:47:52.138 align:start position:0%
would be happy to participate uh in this
 
05:47:54.410 --> 05:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
sort of uh commission
 
05:47:56.030 --> 05:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
um we're regularly just doing uh
 
05:47:58.610 --> 05:47:58.620 align:start position:0%
probably as much research as anyone on
 
05:48:00.890 --> 05:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
this topic so I'd be happy to to share
 
05:48:02.510 --> 05:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
the most recent data that's coming out
 
05:48:04.128 --> 05:48:04.138 align:start position:0%
most of our data we team at the
 
05:48:05.930 --> 05:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
University of Utah
 
05:48:08.208 --> 05:48:08.218 align:start position:0%
um for a lot of This research so I'd be
 
05:48:10.190 --> 05:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
happy to and um I don't have the bill in
 
05:48:11.868 --> 05:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
front of me I should
 
05:48:13.610 --> 05:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know if uh the
 
05:48:15.470 --> 05:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative has included the auto
 
05:48:18.288 --> 05:48:18.298 align:start position:0%
dealers I think having having them on
 
05:48:20.330 --> 05:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
05:48:22.490 --> 05:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
um would be beneficial I'm just thinking
 
05:48:24.288 --> 05:48:24.298 align:start position:0%
of other private organizations that are
 
05:48:24.298 --> 05:48:25.570 align:start position:0%
of other private organizations that are
involved

05:48:25.570 --> 05:48:25.580 align:start position:0%
involved
 
05:48:27.948 --> 05:48:27.958 align:start position:0%
I think having more people around the
 
05:48:29.690 --> 05:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
table is always a good
 
05:48:29.700 --> 05:48:30.770 align:start position:0%
table is always a good
so

05:48:30.770 --> 05:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:48:32.330 --> 05:48:32.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for your feedback on that
 
05:48:32.340 --> 05:48:33.948 align:start position:0%
thank you for your feedback on that
thanks

05:48:33.948 --> 05:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
05:48:35.090 --> 05:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:48:38.288 --> 05:48:38.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:40.970 --> 05:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thank you
 
05:48:43.490 --> 05:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I
 
05:48:43.500 --> 05:48:44.150 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I
um

05:48:44.150 --> 05:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:47.448 --> 05:48:47.458 align:start position:0%
a fellow I am friendly with that is much
 
05:48:50.868 --> 05:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
smarter than I once suggested
 
05:48:50.878 --> 05:48:51.788 align:start position:0%
smarter than I once suggested
um

05:48:51.788 --> 05:48:51.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:54.708 --> 05:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
an action that could take place
 
05:48:57.650 --> 05:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
um rather quickly that would uh
 
05:48:59.690 --> 05:48:59.700 align:start position:0%
um affect texting and driving and I'm
 
05:49:01.730 --> 05:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
wondering if um if you might have an
 
05:49:04.250 --> 05:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
opinion on that from the AAA standpoint
 
05:49:07.128 --> 05:49:07.138 align:start position:0%
or whether you know if this idea has
 
05:49:09.350 --> 05:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
been tried anywhere
 
05:49:13.128 --> 05:49:13.138 align:start position:0%
um the idea was that if uh through legal
 
05:49:15.650 --> 05:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
action if if you could say the insurance
 
05:49:19.430 --> 05:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
companies aren't required to um to pay
 
05:49:22.190 --> 05:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
for a claim if if the insurance company
 
05:49:24.410 --> 05:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
could prove that you were doing
 
05:49:26.750 --> 05:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
something like texting and driving at
 
05:49:29.868 --> 05:49:29.878 align:start position:0%
the time that the accident occurred
 
05:49:31.490 --> 05:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
um has that been ever tried anywhere
 
05:49:33.230 --> 05:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
that you know of
 
05:49:35.750 --> 05:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
um within your AAA Network and by the
 
05:49:40.510 --> 05:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
way I am a in full disclosure AAA
 
05:49:43.670 --> 05:49:43.680 align:start position:0%

kind of um

and Pelham
 
05:59:11.510 --> 05:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
this bill will eliminate the requirement
 
05:59:13.670 --> 05:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
for a passenger vehicle to display a
 
05:59:16.128 --> 05:59:16.138 align:start position:0%
front license plate
 
05:59:17.930 --> 05:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
the mounting of a front license plate
 
05:59:19.670 --> 05:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
can have significant effect on the value
 
05:59:21.350 --> 05:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
of certain vehicles
 
05:59:23.448 --> 05:59:23.458 align:start position:0%
this is especially true with collectible
 
05:59:26.150 --> 05:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
cars higher end sports cars and imported
 
05:59:27.470 --> 05:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles that may not have been designed
 
05:59:30.230 --> 05:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
for North American shaped license plate
 
05:59:32.030 --> 05:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
additionally car manufacturers have been
 
05:59:33.650 --> 05:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
seeking to optimize the aerodynamic
 
05:59:35.270 --> 05:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
profile of their vehicles to maximize
 
05:59:36.530 --> 05:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
fuel efficiency
 
05:59:38.510 --> 05:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
but the front plate Mount on vehicles is
 
05:59:40.250 --> 05:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
optional equipment and not included in
 
05:59:42.770 --> 05:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
EPA testing there's no incentive to
 
05:59:44.390 --> 05:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
optimize it as it doesn't affect the
 
05:59:47.750 --> 05:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:50.390 --> 05:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles with only rear license plates
 
05:59:52.250 --> 05:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
are already on the roads
 
05:59:55.368 --> 05:59:55.378 align:start position:0%
20 States and 9 out of 13 Canadian
 
05:59:57.170 --> 05:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
provinces and territories do not require
 
05:59:59.150 --> 05:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
front license plates
 
06:00:01.190 --> 06:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
seven additional states have exemptions
 
06:00:04.190 --> 06:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
for certain vehicle types or categories
 
06:00:05.810 --> 06:00:05.820 align:start position:0%
our neighbor Vermont effectively
 
06:00:07.310 --> 06:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
repealed the requirement to have a
 
06:00:08.570 --> 06:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
unique front license plate that is
 
06:00:10.430 --> 06:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
useful for identification first
 
06:00:12.350 --> 06:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
temporarily in 2012 this temporary
 
06:00:15.708 --> 06:00:15.718 align:start position:0%
measure was made permanent in 2016.
 
06:00:17.270 --> 06:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
Ohio repealed its front plate
 
06:00:18.948 --> 06:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
requirement on passenger vehicles
 
06:00:21.830 --> 06:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
effective in 2019.
 
06:00:23.628 --> 06:00:23.638 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note on this bill assumes the
 
06:00:25.310 --> 06:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
department would continue manufacturing
 
06:00:27.350 --> 06:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
two plates in every set and only require
 
06:00:29.750 --> 06:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
the vehicle owner to pay for one to
 
06:00:32.090 --> 06:00:32.100 align:start position:0%
forecast the fiscal loss to the state as
 
06:00:33.890 --> 06:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
a result of this bill
 
06:00:35.628 --> 06:00:35.638 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised that the pool of
 
06:00:37.010 --> 06:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
non-commercial vehicles in the state
 
06:00:38.690 --> 06:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be large enough to justify the
 
06:00:40.010 --> 06:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
production and maintenance of a separate
 
06:00:42.170 --> 06:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
set of one plate stock
 
06:00:44.570 --> 06:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
according to news reports Ohio expected
 
06:00:46.788 --> 06:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
to save 1.4 million dollars per year by
 
06:00:49.610 --> 06:00:49.620 align:start position:0%
making fewer plates following its repeal
 
06:00:51.530 --> 06:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
even though it lowered its registration
 
06:00:54.230 --> 06:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
costs when implementing the change
 
06:00:56.330 --> 06:00:56.340 align:start position:0%

about 15 years I'm here to testify in

opposition to HB 260fn relative to
 
06:02:09.230 --> 06:02:09.240 align:start position:0%

want to bore you uh in rereading that to
you

06:02:19.670 --> 06:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:02:21.948 --> 06:02:21.958 align:start position:0%
um I submitted it yesterday so I hope
 
06:02:26.090 --> 06:02:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:28.190 --> 06:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
um over the years a front license plate
 
06:02:31.548 --> 06:02:31.558 align:start position:0%
has uh made my job much easier
 
06:02:33.590 --> 06:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
um I've seen them imprinted into the
 
06:02:36.230 --> 06:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
side of houses into the sides and the
 
06:02:38.930 --> 06:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
rears of other vehicles
 
06:02:41.930 --> 06:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
um in Hit and Run situations
 
06:02:43.750 --> 06:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
um I actually personally witnessed one
 
06:02:47.510 --> 06:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
where a car about 15 miles an hour uh
 
06:02:51.650 --> 06:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
hit the rear of a an old Crown Vic
 
06:02:54.110 --> 06:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
um that happened to have my old chief of
 
06:02:56.990 --> 06:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
police in it and it was only about a 10
 
06:03:00.170 --> 06:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
or a 15 mile an hour crash and that
 
06:03:02.390 --> 06:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
license plate imprinted perfectly on the
 
06:03:05.868 --> 06:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
rear of that old Crown Vic and that
 
06:03:08.208 --> 06:03:08.218 align:start position:0%
person stayed behind obviously they
 
06:03:09.830 --> 06:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
weren't going to go too far with several
 
06:03:11.390 --> 06:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
officers standing around directing
 
06:03:14.330 --> 06:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
traffic around uh one of our sidewalk
 
06:03:16.070 --> 06:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
plows had fallen off the sidewalk and
 
06:03:18.948 --> 06:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
tipped over on that particular day and
 
06:03:21.708 --> 06:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
but it was a perfect example of of just
 
06:03:24.530 --> 06:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh you know how these license plates do
 
06:03:27.830 --> 06:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
hold up in a Collision they are very
 
06:03:30.470 --> 06:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
reflective and they stand out really
 
06:03:32.690 --> 06:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
well in the night time I've always been
 
06:03:34.250 --> 06:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
able to see them well
 
06:03:36.708 --> 06:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
and if you can imagine I've got three
 
06:03:38.990 --> 06:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
roads that run through my town Route 11
 
06:03:42.110 --> 06:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
Route 75 Route 153 and we're also near
 
06:03:44.570 --> 06:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
the Spalding Turnpike we get a lot of
 
06:03:46.610 --> 06:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
bolos from the city of Rochester and
 
06:03:48.410 --> 06:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
Dover and we're always seeing to at
 
06:03:50.030 --> 06:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
least once or twice a day be looking out
 
06:03:52.070 --> 06:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
for a vehicle
 
06:03:53.330 --> 06:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
um that another city or another
 
06:03:55.970 --> 06:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
Community has asked us to look out for
 
06:03:59.090 --> 06:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
and those roads are anywhere from 40 to
 
06:04:02.810 --> 06:04:02.820 align:start position:0%
50 to 55 miles an hour and having a
 
06:04:04.670 --> 06:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
front license plate just makes my life
 
06:04:06.708 --> 06:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
so much easier when I'm trying to look
 
06:04:10.190 --> 06:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
at a vehicle that's passing me at uh 75
 
06:04:12.250 --> 06:04:12.260 align:start position:0%
or 80 feet per second
 
06:04:15.590 --> 06:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
and being able to to see it I mean we
 
06:04:17.570 --> 06:04:17.580 align:start position:0%
are obviously also looking for the color
 
06:04:20.750 --> 06:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
of the car and things like that but
 
06:04:23.930 --> 06:04:23.940 align:start position:0%
um you know we'd have to spin around to
 
06:04:26.990 --> 06:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
look for a particular vehicle and try
 
06:04:29.090 --> 06:04:29.100 align:start position:0%
and get behind it and probably pull over
 
06:04:30.788 --> 06:04:30.798 align:start position:0%
a few people
 
06:04:33.770 --> 06:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
accidentally that we're uh we were
 
06:04:36.470 --> 06:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
looking for a similar car but uh what it
 
06:04:38.750 --> 06:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
was right up until the last moment uh
 
06:04:40.250 --> 06:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
perhaps even when the officer would have
 
06:04:42.350 --> 06:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
hit the blue lights pull somebody over
 
06:04:44.690 --> 06:04:44.700 align:start position:0%
to realize that it's not the right plate
 
06:04:46.850 --> 06:04:46.860 align:start position:0%
we're looking for
 
06:04:48.170 --> 06:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
um those are just a few of the things
 
06:04:50.448 --> 06:04:50.458 align:start position:0%
that I can see
 
06:04:54.650 --> 06:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm a car guy I I
 
06:04:58.548 --> 06:04:58.558 align:start position:0%
like a nice clean front end of my car
 
06:05:02.810 --> 06:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
um but uh the uh the safety
 
06:05:05.150 --> 06:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
um and being able to identify it through
 
06:05:07.070 --> 06:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
that front plate has served me well my
 
06:05:08.868 --> 06:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
whole career
 
06:05:10.910 --> 06:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
um in aerodynamics I spoke to a
 
06:05:13.128 --> 06:05:13.138 align:start position:0%
mechanical engineer who also works on
 
06:05:15.288 --> 06:05:15.298 align:start position:0%
the accident reconstruction team and you
 
06:05:16.548 --> 06:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
have to remember that that front license
 
06:05:19.670 --> 06:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
plate is being followed by two thousand
 
06:05:22.548 --> 06:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
pounds or more of vehicle behind it the
 
06:05:25.208 --> 06:05:25.218 align:start position:0%
engine and the
 
06:05:28.490 --> 06:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
radiator and all of that uh that's going
 
06:05:30.850 --> 06:05:30.860 align:start position:0%
over and around and underneath the car
 
06:05:33.410 --> 06:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
so I think aerodynamically the front
 
06:05:35.890 --> 06:05:35.900 align:start position:0%
license plate being six inches wide and
 
06:05:38.628 --> 06:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
12 inches all right so I'm sorry 12
 
06:05:41.270 --> 06:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
inches wide and six inches tall isn't
 
06:05:45.048 --> 06:05:45.058 align:start position:0%
going to affect gas mileage much we're
 
06:05:46.548 --> 06:05:46.558 align:start position:0%
going to lose more gas mileage than
 
06:05:49.190 --> 06:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
people that have un under inflated tires
 
06:05:51.770 --> 06:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh than we do by having someone with a
 
06:05:54.350 --> 06:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
front plate on their car
 
06:05:56.750 --> 06:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
um in closing I oppose the bill
 
06:05:58.250 --> 06:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
um because of the safety of the public
 
06:06:01.250 --> 06:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
outweighs my car guy vanity
 
06:06:03.110 --> 06:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
um and I would respectfully ask that you
 
06:06:06.128 --> 06:06:06.138 align:start position:0%
find the bill in expedient to legislate
 
06:06:08.868 --> 06:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
having two plates just makes it so much
 
06:06:11.150 --> 06:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
easier to locate a stolen motor vehicle
 
06:06:13.670 --> 06:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
for us it allows for Witnesses and
 
06:06:15.110 --> 06:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
victims to have a better chance of
 
06:06:16.970 --> 06:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
seeing plates of a suspicious vehicle
 
06:06:19.548 --> 06:06:19.558 align:start position:0%
involved in crimes you know when a
 
06:06:21.770 --> 06:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
person pulls into a convenience store to
 
06:06:24.110 --> 06:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
rob it there's a chance that that uh
 
06:06:26.330 --> 06:06:26.340 align:start position:0%
store will have surveillance equipment
 
06:06:28.128 --> 06:06:28.138 align:start position:0%
that will pick up that car's license
 
06:06:30.410 --> 06:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
plate for us and help us solve a crime
 
06:06:32.868 --> 06:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
and it has done so in the past so I'm
 
06:06:34.430 --> 06:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
more than happy to answer any questions
 
06:06:35.810 --> 06:06:35.820 align:start position:0%
I don't want to bore you with the
 
06:06:37.510 --> 06:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
testimony I already provided you with
 
06:06:40.310 --> 06:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
and I greatly appreciate you allowing me
 
06:06:45.070 --> 06:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:47.810 --> 06:06:47.820 align:start position:0%
I see representative to ask you a
 
06:06:47.820 --> 06:06:52.490 align:start position:0%
I see representative to ask you a
question

06:06:52.490 --> 06:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:54.650 --> 06:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Chief jury for
 
06:06:56.150 --> 06:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:07:00.048 --> 06:07:00.058 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the front license plate I
 
06:07:02.750 --> 06:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
know that law enforcement or maybe a
 
06:07:05.690 --> 06:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
little more experienced in how to look
 
06:07:08.208 --> 06:07:08.218 align:start position:0%
and quickly you know identify a plate do
 
06:07:09.470 --> 06:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
you think that when it comes to the
 
06:07:11.690 --> 06:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
general public in terms of things such
 
06:07:13.910 --> 06:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
as Amber Alerts
 
06:07:17.868 --> 06:07:17.878 align:start position:0%
um or any one of those things we see on
 
06:07:21.110 --> 06:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
the news or in the flashing dot signs do
 
06:07:23.208 --> 06:07:23.218 align:start position:0%
you think that having a front plate
 
06:07:26.868 --> 06:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
helps the public in being able to spot
 
06:07:28.430 --> 06:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
those and that might actually make a
 
06:07:30.948 --> 06:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
difference in in a situation of Crisis
 
06:07:33.770 --> 06:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
perhaps with a missing child
 
06:07:36.410 --> 06:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
I definitely do thank you for that
 
06:07:38.750 --> 06:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
question I think by having the front
 
06:07:40.190 --> 06:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
plate you're
 
06:07:42.470 --> 06:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps not quite twice as likely to
 
06:07:45.288 --> 06:07:45.298 align:start position:0%
find that person but I just think it
 
06:07:48.590 --> 06:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
makes it much more much easier with cars
 
06:07:50.390 --> 06:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
coming towards you
 
06:07:51.890 --> 06:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
um Cars and Cars going away from you
 
06:07:53.868 --> 06:07:53.878 align:start position:0%
I've always found it easier to read the
 
06:07:56.090 --> 06:07:56.100 align:start position:0%
plate as the vehicle is approaching me
 
06:07:57.708 --> 06:07:57.718 align:start position:0%
is the Plate's getting bigger the
 
06:07:59.930 --> 06:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
vehicle's getting bigger instead of as
 
06:08:01.610 --> 06:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
the vehicle passes me and it's getting
 
06:08:03.590 --> 06:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
smaller and chasing away and especially
 
06:08:05.570 --> 06:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
where now with our state having a seven
 
06:08:08.030 --> 06:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
digit plate that's a lot of numbers to
 
06:08:10.850 --> 06:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
get quickly in a short amount of time so
 
06:08:13.070 --> 06:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
I really think it it does help and then
 
06:08:15.650 --> 06:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
you know to touch on uh you know you
 
06:08:17.510 --> 06:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
have people that transport bicycles on
 
06:08:19.310 --> 06:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
the back of their cars you have people
 
06:08:21.830 --> 06:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
that are working that may have a ladder
 
06:08:24.470 --> 06:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
or a tailgate down bringing home plywood
 
06:08:27.770 --> 06:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
from Home Depot or someplace and I think
 
06:08:29.930 --> 06:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
just that front Place increases our odds
 
06:08:32.590 --> 06:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
of getting a uh getting a good
 
06:08:35.830 --> 06:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
identification on the car
 
06:08:39.010 --> 06:08:39.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:08:46.368 --> 06:08:46.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:48.650 --> 06:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
06:08:50.750 --> 06:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
Chief Drury
 
06:08:53.570 --> 06:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
um does the State of New Hampshire do
 
06:08:55.670 --> 06:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
police departments here use automatic
 
06:08:58.910 --> 06:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
license plate readers and if so
 
06:09:01.850 --> 06:09:01.860 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't that negate some of the uh
 
06:09:04.610 --> 06:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
concerns that might be had about
 
06:09:06.590 --> 06:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
um identifying Vehicles going at a high
 
06:09:10.788 --> 06:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:14.390 --> 06:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:17.868 --> 06:09:17.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency agencies to use
 
06:09:21.230 --> 06:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
um the those uh it'll be quite a long
 
06:09:23.510 --> 06:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
time before they end up in my department
 
06:09:25.788 --> 06:09:25.798 align:start position:0%
um I don't even have mdts in my cars
 
06:09:27.770 --> 06:09:27.780 align:start position:0%
because I think it's more important for
 
06:09:29.150 --> 06:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
my officers
 
06:09:31.010 --> 06:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
to have their eyes on the road and to
 
06:09:33.110 --> 06:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
have their eyes on what they're looking
 
06:09:35.390 --> 06:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
out the windows at
 
06:09:37.250 --> 06:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
um I do think license plate readers are
 
06:09:37.260 --> 06:09:38.090 align:start position:0%
um I do think license plate readers are
coming

06:09:38.090 --> 06:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
coming
 
06:09:40.190 --> 06:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
um and like I say they were authorized
 
06:09:43.730 --> 06:09:43.740 align:start position:0%
with a lot of restrictions in them
 
06:09:45.708 --> 06:09:45.718 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is and you may have
 
06:09:48.190 --> 06:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
to correct me if I'm wrong I'm not a uh
 
06:09:50.510 --> 06:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
it's something that I hadn't considered
 
06:09:52.788 --> 06:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
from my agency so I'm not up to date on
 
06:09:55.010 --> 06:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
them but I believe the data is only held
 
06:09:57.830 --> 06:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
in the system for about three minutes
 
06:10:00.650 --> 06:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
um and I think it it is a wonderful tool
 
06:10:03.288 --> 06:10:03.298 align:start position:0%
um but I think that that uh technology
 
06:10:07.190 --> 06:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
is still a long ways off for us
 
06:10:10.128 --> 06:10:10.138 align:start position:0%
um and to add to it uh you know the
 
06:10:12.170 --> 06:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
license plate Rita would only see I
 
06:10:13.788 --> 06:10:13.798 align:start position:0%
would imagine what the human eye would
 
06:10:16.310 --> 06:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
in a vehicle coming towards us
 
06:10:17.810 --> 06:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
um I would assume they probably would
 
06:10:20.030 --> 06:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
work as a vehicle going away from us as
 
06:10:21.650 --> 06:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
well but
 
06:10:23.868 --> 06:10:23.878 align:start position:0%
um with the price of a cruiser right now
 
06:10:26.750 --> 06:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
being about thirty one thousand dollars
 
06:10:29.448 --> 06:10:29.458 align:start position:0%
and then another ten thousand dollars to
 
06:10:31.368 --> 06:10:31.378 align:start position:0%
minimally outfit it
 
06:10:33.770 --> 06:10:33.780 align:start position:0%
um and I have six Cruisers from my town
 
06:10:33.780 --> 06:10:35.270 align:start position:0%
um and I have six Cruisers from my town
alone

06:10:35.270 --> 06:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
alone
 
06:10:37.190 --> 06:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming that uh that information
 
06:10:39.170 --> 06:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
and that technology is going to add a
 
06:10:41.270 --> 06:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
significant amount on to onto my budget
 
06:10:42.708 --> 06:10:42.718 align:start position:0%
as well that
 
06:10:44.208 --> 06:10:44.218 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to sell to my board of
 
06:10:51.948 --> 06:10:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:54.048 --> 06:10:54.058 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Chief
 
06:10:54.058 --> 06:10:55.070 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Chief
Drury

06:10:55.070 --> 06:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
Drury
 
06:10:57.708 --> 06:10:57.718 align:start position:0%
my question was similar in that uh
 
06:11:00.530 --> 06:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
automated readers are only good if they
 
06:11:01.910 --> 06:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
can see the plate
 
06:11:05.868 --> 06:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
so reducing the plates by half
 
06:11:08.510 --> 06:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
would reduce the identification
 
06:11:11.930 --> 06:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
possibilities by half I know Nashua uses
 
06:11:11.940 --> 06:11:13.628 align:start position:0%
possibilities by half I know Nashua uses
identification

06:11:13.628 --> 06:11:13.638 align:start position:0%
identification
 
06:11:16.970 --> 06:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
processing and it's been very very
 
06:11:16.980 --> 06:11:17.990 align:start position:0%
processing and it's been very very
helpful

06:11:17.990 --> 06:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
06:11:20.690 --> 06:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to
 
06:11:22.970 --> 06:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
you asked you you answered the same
 
06:11:27.310 --> 06:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:29.628 --> 06:11:29.638 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
06:11:29.638 --> 06:11:32.048 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
representative

06:11:32.048 --> 06:11:32.058 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:11:34.970 --> 06:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
06:11:37.190 --> 06:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm wondering
 
06:11:39.110 --> 06:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
about other states
 
06:11:41.930 --> 06:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
um I know that there's at least a few
 
06:11:45.230 --> 06:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
that that have uh the one plate
 
06:11:45.240 --> 06:11:46.850 align:start position:0%
that that have uh the one plate
requirement

06:11:46.850 --> 06:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
06:11:50.390 --> 06:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
um are there records are there
 
06:11:52.368 --> 06:11:52.378 align:start position:0%
um studies that show they have
 
06:11:54.288 --> 06:11:54.298 align:start position:0%
difficulty in the areas that you
 
06:11:56.390 --> 06:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned are are the advantage of
 
06:11:58.970 --> 06:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
having front plates
 
06:12:01.970 --> 06:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that in front of me
 
06:12:03.590 --> 06:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
um I was able to get a hold of some
 
06:12:05.110 --> 06:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
information from
 
06:12:10.788 --> 06:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:12.530 --> 06:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
um as well as a couple of other states
 
06:12:15.830 --> 06:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh the one information that I found came
 
06:12:17.690 --> 06:12:17.700 align:start position:0%
oddly enough from the Vermont petroleum
 
06:12:17.700 --> 06:12:19.610 align:start position:0%
oddly enough from the Vermont petroleum
Association

06:12:19.610 --> 06:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
Association
 
06:12:21.650 --> 06:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
um and that I have not confirmed this
 
06:12:25.250 --> 06:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
information it was provide provided to
 
06:12:27.890 --> 06:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
um as part of their testimony to the
 
06:12:29.868 --> 06:12:29.878 align:start position:0%
Vermont's house Transportation was that
 
06:12:32.270 --> 06:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle used in 70 percent of all
 
06:12:33.708 --> 06:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
serious crimes throughout the United
 
06:12:35.330 --> 06:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
States according to a study by the

06:12:38.570 --> 06:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
police
 
06:12:40.548 --> 06:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
um so that was kind of the one of the
 
06:12:43.128 --> 06:12:43.138 align:start position:0%
the big takebacks I had I understand
 
06:12:45.170 --> 06:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
there are quite a few you know states
 
06:12:48.048 --> 06:12:48.058 align:start position:0%
that that uh require
 
06:12:50.510 --> 06:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
um only the real plate
 
06:12:53.150 --> 06:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
um you know when I look at things and
 
06:12:55.010 --> 06:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
and looking at our you know our toll
 
06:12:56.990 --> 06:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
booths throughout the state those are
 
06:12:58.190 --> 06:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
things that are going to have to be
 
06:12:58.200 --> 06:12:59.868 align:start position:0%
things that are going to have to be
adjusted

06:12:59.868 --> 06:12:59.878 align:start position:0%
adjusted
 
06:13:01.670 --> 06:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
um to be able to capture only a real
 
06:13:01.680 --> 06:13:03.288 align:start position:0%
um to be able to capture only a real
play

06:13:03.288 --> 06:13:03.298 align:start position:0%
play
 
06:13:05.930 --> 06:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
um and uh that technology as well as
 
06:13:07.490 --> 06:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
those cameras
 
06:13:09.288 --> 06:13:09.298 align:start position:0%
um and if I have a hitch on my vehicle
 
06:13:11.270 --> 06:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
with only one plate am I now obstructing
 
06:13:12.530 --> 06:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
the um
 
06:13:15.048 --> 06:13:15.058 align:start position:0%
you know that license plate
 
06:13:17.628 --> 06:13:17.638 align:start position:0%
um as well as you know like a bicycle on
 
06:13:19.190 --> 06:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
the back of a car
 
06:13:21.890 --> 06:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
things along those lines that may cost
 
06:13:24.650 --> 06:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
the state some toll Revenue
 
06:13:27.288 --> 06:13:27.298 align:start position:0%
um and uh I'll let other I believe
 
06:13:28.970 --> 06:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
there's other testimony coming so I
 
06:13:30.470 --> 06:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to take their steal their
 
06:13:32.270 --> 06:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
Thunder but
 
06:13:34.850 --> 06:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
um things you know things like that I I
 
06:13:36.890 --> 06:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
can't so much speak for other states I
 
06:13:38.030 --> 06:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
know when we're looking for a mass
 
06:13:38.040 --> 06:13:39.650 align:start position:0%
know when we're looking for a mass
vehicle

06:13:39.650 --> 06:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
06:13:41.270 --> 06:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
um we always have to assume that it may
 
06:13:43.128 --> 06:13:43.138 align:start position:0%
only have one plate on it and we're
 
06:13:44.990 --> 06:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
looking for it in our town
 
06:13:47.628 --> 06:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
it slows down our process an awfully lot
 
06:13:49.850 --> 06:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
because if the car is parked say in a
 
06:13:51.590 --> 06:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
bank parking lot or something like that
 
06:13:52.970 --> 06:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
the officer
 
06:13:55.788 --> 06:13:55.798 align:start position:0%
um and it's uh it's backed in with no
 
06:13:57.110 --> 06:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
place showing we've got to get out of
 
06:13:59.810 --> 06:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
our car and go around and and try and
 
06:14:01.430 --> 06:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
06:14:03.890 --> 06:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
um you know as long as it's it's as it's
 
06:14:05.570 --> 06:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
parked in a place that we would consider
 
06:14:07.730 --> 06:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
playing view so I apologize if I
 
06:14:09.288 --> 06:14:09.298 align:start position:0%
digressed a little I hope I answered
 
06:14:11.090 --> 06:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
your question
 
06:14:17.090 --> 06:14:17.100 align:start position:0%

in and worked on these bikes earlier
 
06:16:26.270 --> 06:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
this is evolves this works can anybody

06:17:24.590 --> 06:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
if you can't hear me at home
 
06:17:24.600 --> 06:17:25.610 align:start position:0%
if you can't hear me at home
um

06:17:25.610 --> 06:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:28.190 --> 06:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
I'm testifying today in superb of this
 
06:17:28.200 --> 06:17:29.208 align:start position:0%
I'm testifying today in superb of this
bill

06:17:29.208 --> 06:17:29.218 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:17:33.470 --> 06:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
19 States currently only require one
 
06:17:37.070 --> 06:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:40.310 --> 06:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:43.250 --> 06:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
because when you when you attach it
 
06:17:44.930 --> 06:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
front license plate of roughly all
 
06:17:48.350 --> 06:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
vehicles not just collectible vehicles
 
06:17:50.390 --> 06:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
you usually end up damaging the bumper
 
06:17:52.430 --> 06:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
to do it most cars
 
06:17:54.650 --> 06:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
somebody takes a lot to screwed it into
 
06:17:56.690 --> 06:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
the front bumper and that does damage
 
06:17:59.208 --> 06:17:59.218 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't devalue the car
 
06:18:01.070 --> 06:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
now you could argument that URL if
 
06:18:02.270 --> 06:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
you've put a seller card or something
 
06:18:03.708 --> 06:18:03.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire maybe it doesn't make a
 
06:18:05.150 --> 06:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
difference but the fact of the matter is
 
06:18:07.310 --> 06:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
that sometimes you sell a vehicle out of
 
06:18:10.730 --> 06:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
state and I know for a fact that any
 
06:18:13.850 --> 06:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
vehicle that goes through one plate only
 
06:18:13.860 --> 06:18:15.470 align:start position:0%
vehicle that goes through one plate only
state

06:18:15.470 --> 06:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:18:17.448 --> 06:18:17.458 align:start position:0%
um the vehicles work less because you
 
06:18:19.190 --> 06:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
have pairs now on the bumper
 
06:18:21.770 --> 06:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
so that's one issue and the evidence
 
06:18:23.810 --> 06:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
that the big of that designed to have a
 
06:18:26.990 --> 06:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
front license plate now you didn't uh
 
06:18:28.730 --> 06:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
testimony that
 
06:18:31.190 --> 06:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's a small license plate on a
 
06:18:34.548 --> 06:18:34.558 align:start position:0%
2 000 pound Vapor well the fact of the
 
06:18:37.070 --> 06:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:39.470 --> 06:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
it's all about aerodynamics these days
 
06:18:41.390 --> 06:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
more and more apparently becoming more
 
06:18:44.750 --> 06:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
slippery dynamically to increase fuel
 
06:18:46.670 --> 06:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
efficiency it's not an all-around
 
06:18:48.708 --> 06:18:48.718 align:start position:0%
proposition it's it's tuned with
 
06:18:50.570 --> 06:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
everything you do with the vehicle so
 
06:18:53.030 --> 06:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
having that problem which is a blunt uh
 
06:18:56.810 --> 06:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
surface in the Airstream does make the
 
06:18:59.150 --> 06:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
disrupted airflow around the plate that
 
06:19:00.430 --> 06:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
also can
 
06:19:03.530 --> 06:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
impact the radiator from getting clean
 
06:19:06.048 --> 06:19:06.058 align:start position:0%
air through it as well so that that is
 
06:19:08.750 --> 06:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
an issue in regard to
 
06:19:12.590 --> 06:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh license plates scanners in the state
 
06:19:15.530 --> 06:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
they're here they're being used their
 
06:19:16.970 --> 06:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
their use is going to continue to be
 
06:19:20.570 --> 06:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
used more and more you know as we go on
 
06:19:21.770 --> 06:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
in time
 
06:19:21.780 --> 06:19:22.850 align:start position:0%
in time

[Music]
 
06:19:25.368 --> 06:19:25.378 align:start position:0%
we put a testimonial past that
 
06:19:28.730 --> 06:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
those plates can read the plate
 
06:19:30.590 --> 06:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
on the back it doesn't need a front
 
06:19:33.770 --> 06:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
plate to read it now we've heard that
 
06:19:36.590 --> 06:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
well if the place obstructed well
 
06:19:38.628 --> 06:19:38.638 align:start position:0%
this this pill doesn't prevent or
 
06:19:39.948 --> 06:19:39.958 align:start position:0%
happiness but it doesn't prevent
 
06:19:41.868 --> 06:19:41.878 align:start position:0%
somebody from from taking them off a
 
06:19:45.410 --> 06:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
license plate front hold back or or you
 
06:19:47.030 --> 06:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
know putting something
 
06:19:49.128 --> 06:19:49.138 align:start position:0%
on the vehicle like to block the plate
 
06:19:51.350 --> 06:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
so that that's kind of a side issue from
 
06:19:53.930 --> 06:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
what this this plate uh addresses of
 
06:19:55.970 --> 06:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
what this bill addresses
 
06:19:58.810 --> 06:19:58.820 align:start position:0%
as far as leaving a plane
 
06:20:01.730 --> 06:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
on the front of the vehicle try doing
 
06:20:03.730 --> 06:20:03.740 align:start position:0%
that when you're on the road on a
 
06:20:07.128 --> 06:20:07.138 align:start position:0%
two-lane road where you're traveling at
 
06:20:09.048 --> 06:20:09.058 align:start position:0%
50 60 miles an hour with a progress or
 
06:20:11.150 --> 06:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
120 miles an hour you heard the last
 
06:20:13.128 --> 06:20:13.138 align:start position:0%
seven digits are most placed out it's
 
06:20:15.470 --> 06:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult if not impossible to
 
06:20:17.990 --> 06:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
you may get one or two digits but it's
 
06:20:21.650 --> 06:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
not so easy to do also keep in mind that
 
06:20:24.890 --> 06:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
at night these plates aren't lit so
 
06:20:26.510 --> 06:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement to have the rear
 
06:20:28.310 --> 06:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
plate lit the front plate is no
 
06:20:30.590 --> 06:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
requirement and you cannot see them at
 
06:20:33.230 --> 06:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
night at all so
 
06:20:35.810 --> 06:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
it's my opinion that the the value of
 
06:20:38.890 --> 06:20:38.900 align:start position:0%
having two plates is minimal
 
06:20:41.530 --> 06:20:41.540 align:start position:0%
the state would save some money by only
 
06:20:43.730 --> 06:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
manufacturing one plant it's not a lot
 
06:20:44.990 --> 06:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
of money
 
06:20:45.000 --> 06:20:45.830 align:start position:0%
of money
um

06:20:45.830 --> 06:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:51.410 --> 06:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
and for these reasons uh I support and
 
06:20:54.170 --> 06:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
hope you uh the committee finds it
 
06:20:55.430 --> 06:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
through uh
 
06:20:55.440 --> 06:20:56.510 align:start position:0%
through uh
OTP

06:20:56.510 --> 06:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
OTP
 
06:20:59.470 --> 06:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
for uh for passing this
 
06:21:02.930 --> 06:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
this one plate pocket now keep in mind
 
06:21:06.170 --> 06:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
that if I'm committed those drafted if
 
06:21:07.610 --> 06:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
somebody decides they want to have a
 
06:21:09.048 --> 06:21:09.058 align:start position:0%
second plate nothing in this bill
 
06:21:10.788 --> 06:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
prevents them from having a second plate
 
06:21:12.830 --> 06:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
so it gives people the option that want
 
06:21:14.270 --> 06:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
to go that way if you do if you don't
 
06:21:16.548 --> 06:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
want to do it you don't have to
 
06:21:19.670 --> 06:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
um and you know there's always the
 
06:21:22.910 --> 06:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
sky is falling kind of attitude I would
 
06:21:24.708 --> 06:21:24.718 align:start position:0%
suggest that if this committee passed
 
06:21:26.570 --> 06:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
this and this became law
 
06:21:28.128 --> 06:21:28.138 align:start position:0%
um I don't think you'd hear anymore
 
06:21:33.610 --> 06:21:33.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:37.430 --> 06:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
nothing structured from going back in in
 
06:21:40.030 --> 06:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
having legislation
 
06:21:43.970 --> 06:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
so I hope we we decide to do this now
 
06:21:45.830 --> 06:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
this has been before the committee
 
06:21:47.930 --> 06:21:47.940 align:start position:0%
several times I've talked to several
 
06:21:51.110 --> 06:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
people in the 19 states and
 
06:21:53.030 --> 06:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
the wrong room it doesn't have a deal
 
06:21:54.948 --> 06:21:54.958 align:start position:0%
with it and
 
06:21:57.230 --> 06:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
keep in mind too we New Hampshire we
 
06:21:58.788 --> 06:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
don't have a sign at the board that says
 
06:22:00.470 --> 06:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
if you only have one license plate you
 
06:22:02.150 --> 06:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
can't drive in New Hampshire you have
 
06:22:03.590 --> 06:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
vehicles for many of these other states
 
06:22:05.330 --> 06:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
that drive here
 
06:22:08.330 --> 06:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
um there's never an issue collecting
 
06:22:12.350 --> 06:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
um the Easy Pass toll in fact I have a
 
06:22:13.850 --> 06:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
relative that lives in Florida which is
 
06:22:16.490 --> 06:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
a one-plate state and I've driven that
 
06:22:18.650 --> 06:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
vehicle here two of themselves it's
 
06:22:20.448 --> 06:22:20.458 align:start position:0%
never been a problem so
 
06:22:24.530 --> 06:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
um sometimes we're afraid but I hope you
 
06:22:27.708 --> 06:22:27.718 align:start position:0%
you considered supporting the Bill thank
 
06:22:27.718 --> 06:22:29.208 align:start position:0%
you considered supporting the Bill thank
you

06:22:29.208 --> 06:22:29.218 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:22:30.770 --> 06:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I've got a
 
06:22:33.230 --> 06:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
couple of hands up uh representative
 
06:22:33.240 --> 06:22:35.510 align:start position:0%
couple of hands up uh representative
Sykes

06:22:35.510 --> 06:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
Sykes
 
06:22:38.030 --> 06:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
he's not gonna hear my answer probably
 
06:22:40.430 --> 06:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
no I could actually finally thank you
 
06:22:43.430 --> 06:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh chairman
 
06:22:43.440 --> 06:22:44.930 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh chairman
Walsh

06:22:44.930 --> 06:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
Walsh
 
06:22:47.150 --> 06:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
um I have a question for you chairman
 
06:22:48.650 --> 06:22:48.660 align:start position:0%
Walsh and then I have a question for
 
06:22:50.690 --> 06:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
representative torosian do you have a
 
06:22:52.128 --> 06:22:52.138 align:start position:0%
preference in the order that I asked
 
06:22:52.138 --> 06:22:54.948 align:start position:0%
preference in the order that I asked
them

06:22:54.948 --> 06:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:56.090 --> 06:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
um I don't
 
06:22:58.670 --> 06:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
okay I guess I'll ask representative
 
06:23:00.890 --> 06:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
torosion my question of him first
 
06:23:03.048 --> 06:23:03.058 align:start position:0%
because he's right there we've got a mic
 
06:23:06.350 --> 06:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
that's working for him yay
 
06:23:08.990 --> 06:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
um representative torosian you're one of
 
06:23:11.208 --> 06:23:11.218 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsors of this bill
 
06:23:14.448 --> 06:23:14.458 align:start position:0%
I am curious to know if you would be
 
06:23:14.458 --> 06:23:16.010 align:start position:0%
I am curious to know if you would be
opposed

06:23:16.010 --> 06:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
06:23:20.208 --> 06:23:20.218 align:start position:0%
to uh to considering a possibility that
 
06:23:23.090 --> 06:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
the one license plate requirement would
 
06:23:26.150 --> 06:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
only apply to antique vehicles and
 
06:23:27.590 --> 06:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps some other types of vehicles
 
06:23:30.770 --> 06:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
which by Design are not set up for it
 
06:23:34.610 --> 06:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:34.620 --> 06:23:37.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:23:37.030 --> 06:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:41.448 --> 06:23:41.458 align:start position:0%
he certainly will support that
 
06:23:43.128 --> 06:23:43.138 align:start position:0%
um Amendment if it meant the difference
 
06:23:43.138 --> 06:23:44.628 align:start position:0%
um Amendment if it meant the difference
between

06:23:44.628 --> 06:23:44.638 align:start position:0%
between
 
06:23:49.190 --> 06:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:51.770 --> 06:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
we certainly put up the barrel as it's
 
06:23:54.410 --> 06:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
drafted but I would take that over
 
06:23:56.628 --> 06:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
nothing and I would suggest if you want
 
06:23:59.170 --> 06:23:59.180 align:start position:0%
to go down that road to consider
 
06:24:10.570 --> 06:24:10.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:13.368 --> 06:24:13.378 align:start position:0%
thank you for that Insight uh
 
06:24:16.628 --> 06:24:16.638 align:start position:0%
representators and I appreciate it
 
06:24:20.150 --> 06:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
I've added Collectibles to my uh very
 
06:24:21.770 --> 06:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
short list here
 
06:24:21.780 --> 06:24:22.430 align:start position:0%
short list here
um

06:24:22.430 --> 06:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:25.368 --> 06:24:25.378 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
06:24:27.948 --> 06:24:27.958 align:start position:0%
um in past years when we've heard this
 
06:24:29.990 --> 06:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
bill there's been quite a lot of
 
06:24:32.750 --> 06:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
discussion about toll collecting and and
 
06:24:37.610 --> 06:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
the impacts for this uh one plate Bill
 
06:24:39.948 --> 06:24:39.958 align:start position:0%
and yet today we didn't have any
 
06:24:43.910 --> 06:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
testimony from the tall Pike toll uh
 
06:24:45.948 --> 06:24:45.958 align:start position:0%
Turnpike Authority
 
06:24:47.930 --> 06:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
where they typically are collecting
 
06:24:51.048 --> 06:24:51.058 align:start position:0%
these tolls I wonder if there's some way
 
06:24:53.750 --> 06:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
to get feedback from them to see if
 
06:24:56.208 --> 06:24:56.218 align:start position:0%
anything has changed or do we go back to
 
06:25:00.230 --> 06:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
the 2019 testimony to to learn how this
 
06:25:00.240 --> 06:25:01.010 align:start position:0%
the 2019 testimony to to learn how this
was

06:25:01.010 --> 06:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:25:03.230 --> 06:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
this bill will affect collection of
 
06:25:03.240 --> 06:25:05.270 align:start position:0%
this bill will affect collection of
tolls

06:25:05.270 --> 06:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
tolls
 
06:25:07.730 --> 06:25:07.740 align:start position:0%
yeah representative I'll look into that
 
06:25:10.250 --> 06:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
I was surprised not to see them there uh
 
06:25:12.170 --> 06:25:12.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety either but maybe
 
06:25:14.270 --> 06:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
they decided uh this isn't such a bad
 
06:25:17.690 --> 06:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
Bill after all just perhaps uh maybe
 
06:25:19.970 --> 06:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
they did maybe they didn't
 
06:25:23.150 --> 06:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
help so I remember correctly we looked
 
06:25:25.610 --> 06:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
with the brothers before us the main
 
06:25:27.770 --> 06:25:27.780 align:start position:0%
thing in the audience was that the
 
06:25:30.230 --> 06:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation had was on
 
06:25:32.208 --> 06:25:32.218 align:start position:0%
the cat Lanes that's they said that
 
06:25:34.548 --> 06:25:34.558 align:start position:0%
their cameras on the cash Lanes
 
06:25:36.890 --> 06:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
look at the front coat all the other
 
06:25:39.048 --> 06:25:39.058 align:start position:0%
cameras that dealt with it looked at the
 
06:25:41.150 --> 06:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
rear so the fact that they didn't have
 
06:25:43.610 --> 06:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
it on the front did not apply to
 
06:25:45.410 --> 06:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
anything other than the catch Lanes now
 
06:25:48.530 --> 06:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
I know since then uh my husband passed
 
06:25:49.850 --> 06:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
it they're going to start seeing them
 
06:25:52.670 --> 06:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
disappear perhaps but I will look into
 
06:25:53.868 --> 06:25:53.878 align:start position:0%
it and I'll see if I can get some
 
06:25:53.878 --> 06:25:55.070 align:start position:0%
it and I'll see if I can get some
information

06:25:55.070 --> 06:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:25:57.890 --> 06:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
yeah I would Mr chairman respectfully I
 
06:25:59.390 --> 06:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
would appreciate that that's not quite
 
06:26:01.730 --> 06:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
how I remember their testimony so it'd
 
06:26:03.530 --> 06:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
be really important for them to clarify
 
06:26:06.590 --> 06:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
for us enough
 
06:26:06.600 --> 06:26:10.010 align:start position:0%
for us enough
representative

06:26:10.010 --> 06:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:12.350 --> 06:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you I did have a question but um I
 
06:26:14.208 --> 06:26:14.218 align:start position:0%
see on the participant side there's a
 
06:26:16.250 --> 06:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
couple people with their hands raised
 
06:26:18.048 --> 06:26:18.058 align:start position:0%
that um might be able to provide a
 
06:26:20.150 --> 06:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
little more insight however
 
06:26:20.160 --> 06:26:20.750 align:start position:0%
little more insight however
um

06:26:20.750 --> 06:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:22.910 --> 06:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
I did have one question I can't tell if
 
06:26:24.230 --> 06:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative torosion is still there
 
06:26:25.150 --> 06:26:25.160 align:start position:0%
or not
 
06:26:27.048 --> 06:26:27.058 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
06:26:27.058 --> 06:26:28.368 align:start position:0%
yes sir
okay

06:26:28.368 --> 06:26:28.378 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:26:30.770 --> 06:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you representative torosian um you
 
06:26:33.830 --> 06:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a cost saving since you're
 
06:26:35.510 --> 06:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
only going to have to produce one plate
 
06:26:38.390 --> 06:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
however the bill is exactly the same
 
06:26:41.410 --> 06:26:41.420 align:start position:0%
version as HB 395 which we had in 2019
 
06:26:44.930 --> 06:26:44.940 align:start position:0%
and it's simply written as an option to
 
06:26:44.940 --> 06:26:46.368 align:start position:0%
and it's simply written as an option to
only

06:26:46.368 --> 06:26:46.378 align:start position:0%
only
 
06:26:49.490 --> 06:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
display one plate and if I remember the
 
06:26:52.670 --> 06:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
testimony from the DMV they said there
 
06:26:54.470 --> 06:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
would be no savings because they would
 
06:26:57.410 --> 06:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
still need to produce two plates for
 
06:26:58.970 --> 06:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
every number because they wouldn't know
 
06:27:01.730 --> 06:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
who would want to select only who only
 
06:27:04.788 --> 06:27:04.798 align:start position:0%
one plate has something changed in that
 
06:27:06.350 --> 06:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
um because I don't think this bill is
 
06:27:07.610 --> 06:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
any different from the one we had two
 
06:27:09.048 --> 06:27:09.058 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
06:27:10.430 --> 06:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
06:27:13.670 --> 06:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
question and no what's changed is it
 
06:27:14.690 --> 06:27:14.700 align:start position:0%
would be
 
06:27:18.250 --> 06:27:18.260 align:start position:0%
um you know if this will become more the
 
06:27:21.590 --> 06:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
DNB would get a
 
06:27:24.170 --> 06:27:24.180 align:start position:0%
they get a picture of well how many
 
06:27:24.180 --> 06:27:25.548 align:start position:0%
they get a picture of well how many
vehicles

06:27:25.548 --> 06:27:25.558 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
06:27:27.110 --> 06:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
only would want either one or two
 
06:27:28.788 --> 06:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
players in other words right now it's
 
06:27:30.948 --> 06:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
someone of an unknown but the type of
 
06:27:32.990 --> 06:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
matter is particularly on a new vehicle
 
06:27:34.730 --> 06:27:34.740 align:start position:0%
you rather register you that you could
 
06:27:37.128 --> 06:27:37.138 align:start position:0%
have a group of
 
06:27:39.590 --> 06:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
okay development with two crates you
 
06:27:41.030 --> 06:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
could have just the one plate in other
 
06:27:41.040 --> 06:27:42.230 align:start position:0%
could have just the one plate in other
words

06:27:42.230 --> 06:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
words
 
06:27:44.690 --> 06:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
um when you when you register a vehicle
 
06:27:46.070 --> 06:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
get a new credit
 
06:27:48.048 --> 06:27:48.058 align:start position:0%
you're starting from scratch so I'm
 
06:27:50.330 --> 06:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
getting really for registered
 
06:27:52.788 --> 06:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
um there could be the option if you want
 
06:27:54.830 --> 06:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
one place you can come out of this prior
 
06:27:57.288 --> 06:27:57.298 align:start position:0%
place if you want to it's the the other
 
06:28:00.410 --> 06:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh file so um
 
06:28:03.650 --> 06:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
the reality is less racist place would
 
06:28:05.150 --> 06:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
be printed and that should be a cost
 
06:28:07.548 --> 06:28:07.558 align:start position:0%
savings again I said it would be a minor
 
06:28:08.990 --> 06:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
save but nonetheless it should be a
 
06:28:09.000 --> 06:28:10.850 align:start position:0%
save but nonetheless it should be a
savings

06:28:10.850 --> 06:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
savings
 
06:28:12.530 --> 06:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I guess I would want to
 
06:28:14.448 --> 06:28:14.458 align:start position:0%
hear testimony from the DMV on that if
 
06:28:16.670 --> 06:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
if that's would be in the plans or not
 
06:28:19.010 --> 06:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
06:28:21.288 --> 06:28:21.298 align:start position:0%
yeah we do have a few other times up I
 
06:28:22.850 --> 06:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
recognize a couple of them any more
 
06:28:26.448 --> 06:28:26.458 align:start position:0%
questions for representative throjan
 
06:28:26.458 --> 06:28:27.730 align:start position:0%
questions for representative throjan
soon

06:28:27.730 --> 06:28:27.740 align:start position:0%
soon
 
06:28:30.110 --> 06:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
06:28:30.120 --> 06:28:32.090 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
committee

06:28:32.090 --> 06:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:28:39.788 --> 06:28:39.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:42.048 --> 06:28:42.058 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman can you hear
 
06:28:42.058 --> 06:28:43.990 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman can you hear
me

06:28:43.990 --> 06:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
me
 
06:28:46.010 --> 06:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
06:28:47.030 --> 06:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Captain
 
06:28:48.830 --> 06:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
William Haynes I'm with the office of
 
06:28:50.390 --> 06:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
Highway Safety but I'm here today also
 
06:28:52.490 --> 06:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
representing Department of Safety and I
 
06:28:53.570 --> 06:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
just want to indicate that the
 
06:28:55.368 --> 06:28:55.378 align:start position:0%
department of safety is opposed to this
 
06:28:56.810 --> 06:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
bill that we still feel very strongly
 
06:28:58.730 --> 06:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
that for safety concerns and other
 
06:29:00.350 --> 06:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
reasons that we should stay with the two
 
06:29:02.510 --> 06:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
plate mandate and I just would like to
 
06:29:04.970 --> 06:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
clarify one thing um there was a some
 
06:29:06.770 --> 06:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
testimony that perhaps you can't see a
 
06:29:07.970 --> 06:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
license plate in the front at night
 
06:29:09.288 --> 06:29:09.298 align:start position:0%
however those plates are highly
 
06:29:11.330 --> 06:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
reflective and with my 19 years of
 
06:29:12.830 --> 06:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
Patrol in the roads I can read front
 
06:29:14.690 --> 06:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
plates I I make it a practice to read
 
06:29:15.948 --> 06:29:15.958 align:start position:0%
them as they go by me unless they're
 
06:29:17.930 --> 06:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
obscured in some way so because they are
 
06:29:19.250 --> 06:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
highly reflective and because of the
 
06:29:20.810 --> 06:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
headlights that we have and especially
 
06:29:23.030 --> 06:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
nowadays with some of the LED LED
 
06:29:24.770 --> 06:29:24.780 align:start position:0%
headlights you can see them very clearly
 
06:29:27.048 --> 06:29:27.058 align:start position:0%
and if you took on your way home this
 
06:29:28.190 --> 06:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
evening hopefully you're not out that
 
06:29:29.868 --> 06:29:29.878 align:start position:0%
late but if you were to be driving the
 
06:29:31.430 --> 06:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
next evening and you you paid attention
 
06:29:33.110 --> 06:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
you see that you couldn't Factory that
 
06:29:35.628 --> 06:29:35.638 align:start position:0%
plate so again on both behalf office of
 
06:29:37.430 --> 06:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
Highway Safety and Department of Safety
 
06:29:40.010 --> 06:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
were opposed to uh only going to one
 
06:29:43.788 --> 06:29:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:45.890 --> 06:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
any questions for Captain Haynes from
 
06:29:48.230 --> 06:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
the committee yes I have
 
06:29:48.240 --> 06:29:49.850 align:start position:0%
the committee yes I have
representative

06:29:49.850 --> 06:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:29:52.270 --> 06:29:52.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
06:29:56.448 --> 06:29:56.458 align:start position:0%
experience for your uh testimony and I'm
 
06:29:58.730 --> 06:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
interested to know how do you feel about
 
06:30:02.590 --> 06:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
uh if this bill were to be changed
 
06:30:06.890 --> 06:30:06.900 align:start position:0%
to only uh allow vehicles that were
 
06:30:10.128 --> 06:30:10.138 align:start position:0%
antiques or Collectibles to have just in
 
06:30:11.810 --> 06:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
one plate
 
06:30:13.670 --> 06:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
well that's an interesting question I I
 
06:30:15.530 --> 06:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
know that's very um there's a very small
 
06:30:17.030 --> 06:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
amount to those so I think the impact
 
06:30:18.890 --> 06:30:18.900 align:start position:0%
would be minimal but I again I question
 
06:30:20.448 --> 06:30:20.458 align:start position:0%
once we open that door whether we're
 
06:30:22.250 --> 06:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
opening the door further I know I
 
06:30:24.650 --> 06:30:24.660 align:start position:0%
personally own seven other modern hot
 
06:30:26.750 --> 06:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
rods that it did hurt my feelings to
 
06:30:29.030 --> 06:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
drill holes in the front bumper but I
 
06:30:31.548 --> 06:30:31.558 align:start position:0%
realized that the uh the benefits from a
 
06:30:33.288 --> 06:30:33.298 align:start position:0%
safety perspective clearly outweigh the
 
06:30:34.970 --> 06:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
the two holes that I had to drill in my
 
06:30:36.948 --> 06:30:36.958 align:start position:0%
bumper for what it's worth but
 
06:30:38.690 --> 06:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
um I think from a department of safety
 
06:30:40.010 --> 06:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
perspective we'd like to stay with the
 
06:30:41.170 --> 06:30:41.180 align:start position:0%
two plates
 
06:30:41.180 --> 06:30:43.128 align:start position:0%
two plates
yeah

06:30:43.128 --> 06:30:43.138 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:30:46.070 --> 06:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you compare questions for Captain
 
06:30:47.930 --> 06:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
Owens Haynes
 
06:30:47.940 --> 06:30:50.270 align:start position:0%
Owens Haynes
representative

06:30:50.270 --> 06:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:30:52.010 --> 06:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chairman Captain
 
06:30:55.368 --> 06:30:55.378 align:start position:0%
Haynes thank you um is what's the
 
06:30:56.990 --> 06:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of a plate is there any reason
 
06:31:01.548 --> 06:31:01.558 align:start position:0%
other than identification of the vehicle
 
06:31:05.330 --> 06:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
and by that the owner also it does a
 
06:31:06.590 --> 06:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
number of things actually I mean that's
 
06:31:08.750 --> 06:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
its primary responsibilities is to
 
06:31:10.128 --> 06:31:10.138 align:start position:0%
indicate that the vehicle is properly
 
06:31:10.138 --> 06:31:11.510 align:start position:0%
indicate that the vehicle is properly
registered

06:31:11.510 --> 06:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
registered
 
06:31:13.070 --> 06:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
um and so one of the things we do and
 
06:31:14.448 --> 06:31:14.458 align:start position:0%
and obviously you know that's tied to
 
06:31:15.650 --> 06:31:15.660 align:start position:0%
revenues and everything else in our
 
06:31:17.510 --> 06:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
state as significant revenues at the top
 
06:31:19.250 --> 06:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
level but it what it does do is it
 
06:31:20.930 --> 06:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
allows us to recognize immediately that
 
06:31:22.548 --> 06:31:22.558 align:start position:0%
the person operating that vehicle that
 
06:31:24.470 --> 06:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle is properly registered with that
 
06:31:26.090 --> 06:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
plate and on that plate are stickers as
 
06:31:28.250 --> 06:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
you know it's the year and then the
 
06:31:29.990 --> 06:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
month of the year but it also identifies
 
06:31:31.670 --> 06:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
that the vehicle is not only registered
 
06:31:32.750 --> 06:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
in that year but helps us to Sister
 
06:31:35.330 --> 06:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
ensure that that vehicle is is got the
 
06:31:36.770 --> 06:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
right safety inspection for the right
 
06:31:38.570 --> 06:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
period of time if I imagine the color of
 
06:31:40.430 --> 06:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
the front plate verified it's within the
 
06:31:41.690 --> 06:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
correct year and then look at
 
06:31:43.368 --> 06:31:43.378 align:start position:0%
simultaneously at the windshield and
 
06:31:44.810 --> 06:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
verifying that they're called a sticker
 
06:31:46.670 --> 06:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
so it does a number of things outside of
 
06:31:48.590 --> 06:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
crime but just for pure Traffic Safety
 
06:31:52.070 --> 06:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
perspective uh in pure ensuring people
 
06:31:53.930 --> 06:31:53.940 align:start position:0%
are complying with the laws and rules of
 
06:31:55.610 --> 06:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
the state as it relates to safe
 
06:31:57.410 --> 06:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
operation not safe operation but
 
06:31:59.150 --> 06:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
operating vehicles that are safe to be
 
06:32:01.730 --> 06:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
on our roadways
 
06:32:03.110 --> 06:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that
 
06:32:03.120 --> 06:32:05.448 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that
clarification

06:32:05.448 --> 06:32:05.458 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
06:32:08.628 --> 06:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
if there's a question from the committee
 
06:32:12.170 --> 06:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
CNN thank you Captain Haynes thank you
 
06:32:13.788 --> 06:32:13.798 align:start position:0%
very much
 
06:32:13.798 --> 06:32:21.128 align:start position:0%
very much

oberdank and I am testifying on this
 
06:32:36.230 --> 06:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
bill today on behalf of the Division of
 
06:32:38.990 --> 06:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles and we are also in
 
06:32:39.000 --> 06:32:40.368 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles and we are also in
opposition

06:32:40.368 --> 06:32:40.378 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
06:32:42.590 --> 06:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
to this bill for a number of reasons
 
06:32:44.208 --> 06:32:44.218 align:start position:0%
which I will outline
 
06:32:46.670 --> 06:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
the first is the language in the bill
 
06:32:49.548 --> 06:32:49.558 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear if it included all plate
 
06:32:49.558 --> 06:32:50.868 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear if it included all plate
types

06:32:50.868 --> 06:32:50.878 align:start position:0%
types
 
06:32:52.430 --> 06:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
um as you know there are many different
 
06:32:54.350 --> 06:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
plate types
 
06:32:56.270 --> 06:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
um but but most importantly one of the
 
06:32:59.090 --> 06:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
pieces of clarification that sought is
 
06:33:01.610 --> 06:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
it says and further provided that a
 
06:33:03.830 --> 06:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
passenger vehicle shall only be required
 
06:33:05.930 --> 06:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
to display one number plate
 
06:33:08.570 --> 06:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
or a passenger vehicle
 
06:33:10.850 --> 06:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
um to us means school bus and motor
 
06:33:13.548 --> 06:33:13.558 align:start position:0%
coach so if we're talking about the
 
06:33:15.410 --> 06:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
passenger car
 
06:33:17.270 --> 06:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
um that language change
 
06:33:19.490 --> 06:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
would need to be done
 
06:33:21.650 --> 06:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
um but specifically to talk a little bit
 
06:33:24.170 --> 06:33:24.180 align:start position:0%
about what representative tolersky keyed
 
06:33:26.510 --> 06:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
in on was our main talking point is the
 
06:33:30.770 --> 06:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
distribution of place to 234 towns
 
06:33:33.470 --> 06:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
at what percentage do we distribute
 
06:33:36.890 --> 06:33:36.900 align:start position:0%
single plates versus two sets of plates
 
06:33:39.470 --> 06:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
how do we begin to guess who's going to
 
06:33:42.110 --> 06:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
take advantage of this program do we do
 
06:33:43.490 --> 06:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
10 percent
 
06:33:46.250 --> 06:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
get a single plate do we do 90 we think
 
06:33:48.830 --> 06:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
are going to stay with the double plates
 
06:33:50.570 --> 06:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
um there's a significant
 
06:33:52.910 --> 06:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
significant amount of logistics behind
 
06:33:55.970 --> 06:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
making sure 234 towns have the correct
 
06:33:58.070 --> 06:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
plates are we to assume that everybody
 
06:33:59.868 --> 06:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
gets two plates and that you simply
 
06:34:01.430 --> 06:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
throw one plate out
 
06:34:04.670 --> 06:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh do you no longer allow citizens to
 
06:34:08.030 --> 06:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
walk into a DMV or a town and expect to
 
06:34:09.708 --> 06:34:09.718 align:start position:0%
walk out with plates because now we
 
06:34:11.770 --> 06:34:11.780 align:start position:0%
would order them and send them versus
 
06:34:14.208 --> 06:34:14.218 align:start position:0%
having different plate types and stock
 
06:34:17.208 --> 06:34:17.218 align:start position:0%
of Which percentage we're not sure
 
06:34:19.670 --> 06:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
um so for all of those reasons and the
 
06:34:22.250 --> 06:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
reasons described by by Captain Haynes
 
06:34:24.948 --> 06:34:24.958 align:start position:0%
and State Police we are opposed
 
06:34:27.410 --> 06:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
um to the bill as it's written and I'll
 
06:34:29.510 --> 06:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions you may
 
06:34:29.520 --> 06:34:32.810 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions you may
have

06:34:32.810 --> 06:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:35.510 --> 06:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you around any questions from the
 
06:34:35.520 --> 06:34:38.230 align:start position:0%
thank you around any questions from the
committee

06:34:38.230 --> 06:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:41.270 --> 06:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
CNN thank you very much
 
06:34:42.350 --> 06:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:34:46.330 --> 06:34:46.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:49.310 --> 06:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
I'll do my best with this Chris wanna
 
06:34:49.320 --> 06:34:53.990 align:start position:0%
I'll do my best with this Chris wanna
Christmas

06:34:53.990 --> 06:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:55.490 --> 06:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
well good afternoon
 
06:34:55.500 --> 06:34:56.150 align:start position:0%
well good afternoon
um

06:34:56.150 --> 06:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:58.490 --> 06:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
members of the committee Mr chair can
 
06:35:00.830 --> 06:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
you can you hear me okay now good
 
06:35:02.868 --> 06:35:02.878 align:start position:0%
afternoon congratulations to represent
 
06:35:02.878 --> 06:35:04.368 align:start position:0%
afternoon congratulations to represent
please

please
 
06:35:06.590 --> 06:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
I know the audio from the room is is a
 
06:35:08.270 --> 06:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
little difficult to hear but um I just
 
06:35:10.610 --> 06:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
want to make sure you can hear me so my
 
06:35:12.230 --> 06:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
name is Chris waschock and I'm the
 
06:35:13.490 --> 06:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner of the Department of
 
06:35:13.500 --> 06:35:15.350 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner of the Department of
Transportation

06:35:15.350 --> 06:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
06:35:18.650 --> 06:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to State the Departments
 
06:35:21.770 --> 06:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
um concern with this bill this bill has
 
06:35:21.780 --> 06:35:22.910 align:start position:0%
um concern with this bill this bill has
been

06:35:22.910 --> 06:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
been
 
06:35:24.708 --> 06:35:24.718 align:start position:0%
um before this Committee in the Years
 
06:35:24.718 --> 06:35:26.270 align:start position:0%
um before this Committee in the Years
passed

06:35:26.270 --> 06:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
passed
 
06:35:27.830 --> 06:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
um the requirement that only the rear
 
06:35:30.230 --> 06:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
plate of the passenger vehicle be
 
06:35:32.628 --> 06:35:32.638 align:start position:0%
displayed is very problematic for the
 
06:35:34.670 --> 06:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
Easy Pass system
 
06:35:38.810 --> 06:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
um right now we have a system that can
 
06:35:41.090 --> 06:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
capture both the front and the rear
 
06:35:43.850 --> 06:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
plate and by eliminating one of those
 
06:35:46.788 --> 06:35:46.798 align:start position:0%
options it certainly reduces our ability
 
06:35:50.930 --> 06:35:50.940 align:start position:0%
to effectively be able to enforce any
 
06:35:54.410 --> 06:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
violations or unpaid transactions I just
 
06:35:56.150 --> 06:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
want to give some statistics on the Easy
 
06:35:58.490 --> 06:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
Pass system for some of the members of
 
06:36:00.890 --> 06:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
the committee in essence
 
06:36:03.350 --> 06:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
um easy pass is used by 30 toll agencies
 
06:36:06.110 --> 06:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
in 19 States the system provides a
 
06:36:07.670 --> 06:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
seamless efficient effective way to
 
06:36:09.948 --> 06:36:09.958 align:start position:0%
collect that toll from both in-state
 
06:36:11.810 --> 06:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
residents and out-of-state users
 
06:36:13.430 --> 06:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
particularly when we're talking about
 
06:36:16.548 --> 06:36:16.558 align:start position:0%
Open Road tolling and all electronic
 
06:36:19.128 --> 06:36:19.138 align:start position:0%
tolling which in essence will eliminate
 
06:36:22.030 --> 06:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
the toll booth and cash option and go to
 
06:36:24.470 --> 06:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know Seoul
 
06:36:26.868 --> 06:36:26.878 align:start position:0%
um transponder base a license based
 
06:36:26.878 --> 06:36:28.250 align:start position:0%
um transponder base a license based
collection

06:36:28.250 --> 06:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
collection
 
06:36:29.690 --> 06:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
um that is being implemented in the
 
06:36:31.490 --> 06:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
Spalding Turnpike
 
06:36:31.500 --> 06:36:32.990 align:start position:0%
Spalding Turnpike
in

06:36:32.990 --> 06:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:36:36.470 --> 06:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
um about 18 months to two years so the
 
06:36:39.288 --> 06:36:39.298 align:start position:0%
department is moving towards that type
 
06:36:41.628 --> 06:36:41.638 align:start position:0%
of approach
 
06:36:44.270 --> 06:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
um the turnpike system also operates as
 
06:36:45.948 --> 06:36:45.958 align:start position:0%
an Enterprise fund where all the revenue
 
06:36:47.690 --> 06:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
collected on the system is used on the
 
06:36:47.700 --> 06:36:48.410 align:start position:0%
collected on the system is used on the
system

06:36:48.410 --> 06:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:36:50.750 --> 06:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
you know certainly the system that
 
06:36:52.670 --> 06:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
Revenue pays for the systems operation
 
06:36:54.948 --> 06:36:54.958 align:start position:0%
and maintenance it pays for the
 
06:36:57.048 --> 06:36:57.058 align:start position:0%
outstanding bonds that we use to build
 
06:37:00.110 --> 06:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
the system it pays for RNR work or
 
06:37:02.330 --> 06:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
renewal and reconstruction work to make
 
06:37:03.948 --> 06:37:03.958 align:start position:0%
sure the system is in good work in order
 
06:37:07.970 --> 06:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
and then the remaining revenues put to
 
06:37:10.310 --> 06:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
the capital expansion program so all the
 
06:37:12.708 --> 06:37:12.718 align:start position:0%
money is put right back into the system
 
06:37:15.048 --> 06:37:15.058 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 19 prior to the pandemic
 
06:37:16.970 --> 06:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
131 million of total revenue was
 
06:37:20.390 --> 06:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
collected in fiscal year 20 that Revenue
 
06:37:22.490 --> 06:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
dropped to 118 million because of the
 
06:37:24.430 --> 06:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
reduction in traffic
 
06:37:28.910 --> 06:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
we collected 110 million transactions of
 
06:37:31.970 --> 06:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
those 110 million transactions in fiscal
 
06:37:35.628 --> 06:37:35.638 align:start position:0%
year 20 where no valid transponder was
 
06:37:37.788 --> 06:37:37.798 align:start position:0%
read the license plate of the vehicle
 
06:37:39.048 --> 06:37:39.058 align:start position:0%
was captured
 
06:37:43.250 --> 06:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
roughly 6.4 million images were read
 
06:37:45.470 --> 06:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
and according to our back office event a
 
06:37:47.330 --> 06:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
roughly 60 percent of those images or
 
06:37:50.510 --> 06:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
3.8 million of the front plate
 
06:37:53.330 --> 06:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about a very very high
 
06:37:54.890 --> 06:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
risk here
 
06:37:56.868 --> 06:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
um when those images are read some of
 
06:38:00.530 --> 06:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
those images uh basically categorized
 
06:38:02.750 --> 06:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
and associated with the account in an
 
06:38:05.390 --> 06:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
itol so for example is a pest account
 
06:38:08.570 --> 06:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
holders that have transponders if for
 
06:38:10.250 --> 06:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
some reason their transplant is not red
 
06:38:13.610 --> 06:38:13.620 align:start position:0%
or they're sharing a transponder or they
 
06:38:16.128 --> 06:38:16.138 align:start position:0%
have for whatever reason remove the
 
06:38:17.810 --> 06:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
transponder from the windshield that
 
06:38:20.390 --> 06:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
license plate is red and then that plate
 
06:38:23.208 --> 06:38:23.218 align:start position:0%
is associated with the vehicle with with
 
06:38:24.948 --> 06:38:24.958 align:start position:0%
the account and the toll was extracted
 
06:38:27.410 --> 06:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
from the account with no issues
 
06:38:27.420 --> 06:38:28.490 align:start position:0%
from the account with no issues
um

06:38:28.490 --> 06:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:30.708 --> 06:38:30.718 align:start position:0%
there's a seven day to pay provision so
 
06:38:32.330 --> 06:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
if someone doesn't have an account goes
 
06:38:34.310 --> 06:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
through they can go online and pay so
 
06:38:36.048 --> 06:38:36.058 align:start position:0%
the license plate
 
06:38:36.058 --> 06:38:36.670 align:start position:0%
the license plate
um

06:38:36.670 --> 06:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:40.850 --> 06:38:40.860 align:start position:0%
that's captured is used by that um by
 
06:38:44.390 --> 06:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
that aspect and then for those that um
 
06:38:47.150 --> 06:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
do not pay we send them an invoice to
 
06:38:49.368 --> 06:38:49.378 align:start position:0%
collect the tolls so it's very
 
06:38:51.470 --> 06:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
concerning in a potential High Revenue
 
06:38:54.948 --> 06:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
loss for the system if the front plate
 
06:38:58.010 --> 06:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
is eliminated on vehicles
 
06:39:00.708 --> 06:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
um the department provides
 
06:39:02.930 --> 06:39:02.940 align:start position:0%
um I would say the department is highly
 
06:39:05.868 --> 06:39:05.878 align:start position:0%
reliable on being able to capture both
 
06:39:09.110 --> 06:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
plates many times and it's been noted
 
06:39:11.570 --> 06:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
before in past testimony there may be a
 
06:39:13.970 --> 06:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
bike rack on the rear there may be a
 
06:39:15.890 --> 06:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
trailer being pulled there may be some
 
06:39:18.110 --> 06:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
other a Prudence that's blocking the
 
06:39:21.350 --> 06:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
rear plate and without the front plate
 
06:39:23.390 --> 06:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
we would not be able to collect that
 
06:39:27.170 --> 06:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
tool so having that redundancy and
 
06:39:29.390 --> 06:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
ability to read either the front or the
 
06:39:32.270 --> 06:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
rear plate is paranoid Paramount to
 
06:39:33.830 --> 06:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
maximizing the collection of the toll
 
06:39:36.590 --> 06:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue when there is no transponder
 
06:39:38.150 --> 06:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's read in the lanes
 
06:39:40.128 --> 06:39:40.138 align:start position:0%
Additionally the department does not
 
06:39:42.110 --> 06:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
have rear cameras in all of its toe
 
06:39:45.288 --> 06:39:45.298 align:start position:0%
Lanes the cash only Lanes at all the
 
06:39:47.990 --> 06:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
toll plazas only have front cameras
 
06:39:51.288 --> 06:39:51.298 align:start position:0%
installed to capture the violators so if
 
06:39:53.090 --> 06:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
this bill is passed in addition to the
 
06:39:55.010 --> 06:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
potential High Revenue loss and
 
06:39:56.690 --> 06:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
electronic toll Lanes
 
06:39:58.310 --> 06:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
the department would need to install
 
06:40:00.650 --> 06:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
rear cameras in 26 lanes and an
 
06:40:02.570 --> 06:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
estimated cost of nine thousand per Lane
 
06:40:06.708 --> 06:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
with 234 thousand dollars so
 
06:40:09.430 --> 06:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
um for the reasons above
 
06:40:13.128 --> 06:40:13.138 align:start position:0%
the department cannot support this bill
 
06:40:15.410 --> 06:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
um with the requirement that only one
 
06:40:18.470 --> 06:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
license plate to rear plate the uh be
 
06:40:20.930 --> 06:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
required and that concludes my testimony
 
06:40:22.190 --> 06:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to answer any questions
 
06:40:25.010 --> 06:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
the committee may have and I believe my
 
06:40:27.530 --> 06:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
testimony was also submitted
 
06:40:31.430 --> 06:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:33.350 --> 06:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr White Shark actually I have
 
06:40:34.310 --> 06:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
a question
 
06:40:36.110 --> 06:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah first of you did something
 
06:40:39.230 --> 06:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
written testimony and if you did observe
 
06:40:41.690 --> 06:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
it in the zoo the statistics that you
 
06:40:44.110 --> 06:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
you told us about the uh how many
 
06:40:46.788 --> 06:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
registered front plate recordings are
 
06:40:46.798 --> 06:40:48.650 align:start position:0%
registered front plate recordings are
there

06:40:48.650 --> 06:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:40:51.470 --> 06:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it's very difficult to discern
 
06:40:53.790 --> 06:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
exactly what you you're asking
 
06:40:53.800 --> 06:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
exactly what you you're asking
[Music]

06:40:59.820 --> 06:40:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:59.830 --> 06:41:13.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:41:13.390 --> 06:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:15.288 --> 06:41:15.298 align:start position:0%
other states
 
06:41:15.298 --> 06:41:16.670 align:start position:0%
other states
hi

06:41:16.670 --> 06:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
hi
 
06:41:19.310 --> 06:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
I am sorry the way you're coming across
 
06:41:22.250 --> 06:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
it's very mumbled and I cannot make out
 
06:41:24.850 --> 06:41:24.860 align:start position:0%
any word that you're saying I apologize
 
06:41:27.410 --> 06:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
I know if there's a better microphone
 
06:41:29.150 --> 06:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
well I've been fighting with this thing
 
06:41:34.990 --> 06:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:37.610 --> 06:41:37.620 align:start position:0%
let me try somebody else see if you can
 
06:41:40.548 --> 06:41:40.558 align:start position:0%
hear them our representative
 
06:41:43.070 --> 06:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
I basically had the same question you
 
06:41:45.048 --> 06:41:45.058 align:start position:0%
did Mr chairman well you can try it
 
06:41:47.830 --> 06:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
maybe I can hear your representative
 
06:41:51.170 --> 06:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
you can't hear me yes I can loud and
 
06:41:51.180 --> 06:41:51.948 align:start position:0%
you can't hear me yes I can loud and
clear

06:41:51.948 --> 06:41:51.958 align:start position:0%
clear
 
06:41:54.110 --> 06:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
okay maybe
 
06:41:55.730 --> 06:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
06:41:58.310 --> 06:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
um so yeah well part of part of our
 
06:42:02.330 --> 06:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:04.970 --> 06:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
they each vehicles that only have one
 
06:42:07.070 --> 06:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
license plate I mean are you losing
 
06:42:09.110 --> 06:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
revenue from them
 
06:42:09.120 --> 06:42:10.670 align:start position:0%
revenue from them
well

06:42:10.670 --> 06:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:42:12.830 --> 06:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
um so we do have the ability to capture
 
06:42:14.208 --> 06:42:14.218 align:start position:0%
the rear plane
 
06:42:17.270 --> 06:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
so in in those instances the rare play
 
06:42:19.430 --> 06:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
is captured and certainly if they're
 
06:42:23.090 --> 06:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
if that replay is blocked then yes that
 
06:42:25.788 --> 06:42:25.798 align:start position:0%
is lost Revenue because
 
06:42:27.410 --> 06:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
um you know we really don't have the
 
06:42:30.350 --> 06:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
ability to have that added redundancy
 
06:42:34.670 --> 06:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
now I will say that the majority of the
 
06:42:37.850 --> 06:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
traffic on our system is from Maine New
 
06:42:37.860 --> 06:42:38.810 align:start position:0%
traffic on our system is from Maine New
Hampshire

06:42:38.810 --> 06:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:42:40.448 --> 06:42:40.458 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts
 
06:42:45.070 --> 06:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
uh Vermont is you know probably fourth
 
06:42:47.690 --> 06:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
Vermont is the only state in New England
 
06:42:50.930 --> 06:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
that has this one plate requirement I
 
06:42:53.750 --> 06:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
will say and I downloaded and it was
 
06:42:55.250 --> 06:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
actually last year so I don't know if
 
06:42:57.850 --> 06:42:57.860 align:start position:0%
it's been updated you know which states
 
06:43:01.490 --> 06:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
uh require only one plate and the
 
06:43:03.530 --> 06:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
majority of the states
 
06:43:05.570 --> 06:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
are southern states they don't have any
 
06:43:07.330 --> 06:43:07.340 align:start position:0%
winter issues
 
06:43:11.750 --> 06:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
and they likely other than Florida the
 
06:43:13.548 --> 06:43:13.558 align:start position:0%
majority of those states don't have any
 
06:43:15.170 --> 06:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
toll authorities
 
06:43:15.180 --> 06:43:16.490 align:start position:0%
toll authorities
so

06:43:16.490 --> 06:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:43:18.230 --> 06:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm not saying that there aren't any
 
06:43:20.690 --> 06:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
states without with the um without what
 
06:43:22.128 --> 06:43:22.138 align:start position:0%
that have told authorities and only
 
06:43:23.750 --> 06:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
require one plate but what I'm saying is
 
06:43:27.230 --> 06:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of those 19 uh
 
06:43:29.628 --> 06:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
southern states without toll authorities
 
06:43:29.638 --> 06:43:30.948 align:start position:0%
southern states without toll authorities
so

06:43:30.948 --> 06:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:43:33.530 --> 06:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
um this is a serious serious concern for
 
06:43:36.048 --> 06:43:36.058 align:start position:0%
for the Easy Pass system and the
 
06:43:38.208 --> 06:43:38.218 align:start position:0%
potential of lost Revenue I cannot tell
 
06:43:38.218 --> 06:43:39.110 align:start position:0%
potential of lost Revenue I cannot tell
you

06:43:39.110 --> 06:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:43:41.750 --> 06:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
how much lost Revenue that potentially
 
06:43:44.930 --> 06:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
will be because you know right now
 
06:43:47.570 --> 06:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
a vendor is the way that they're trained
 
06:43:50.208 --> 06:43:50.218 align:start position:0%
they they automatically to fall to the
 
06:43:52.368 --> 06:43:52.378 align:start position:0%
front plate and if that front plate is
 
06:43:54.288 --> 06:43:54.298 align:start position:0%
legible they use that plate they don't
 
06:43:56.948 --> 06:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
look at the rear plate and 60
 
06:44:02.750 --> 06:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:05.030 --> 06:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
I hope that answers your question
 
06:44:07.610 --> 06:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
06:44:07.620 --> 06:44:13.570 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
um

06:44:13.570 --> 06:44:13.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:17.270 --> 06:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
Mr Harris Jennifer yeah it's a quick
 
06:44:19.368 --> 06:44:19.378 align:start position:0%
follow-up dinner question
 
06:44:19.378 --> 06:44:21.288 align:start position:0%
follow-up dinner question
um

06:44:21.288 --> 06:44:21.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:44:24.350 --> 06:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
um the 60 that were red of my plates was
 
06:44:25.910 --> 06:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
that determined that the back plate was
 
06:44:28.368 --> 06:44:28.378 align:start position:0%
unreadable was that just like a
 
06:44:29.570 --> 06:44:29.580 align:start position:0%
different place first and that's where
 
06:44:32.868 --> 06:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
it stopped no so what that meant so the
 
06:44:36.230 --> 06:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
vendors process is that they typically
 
06:44:38.448 --> 06:44:38.458 align:start position:0%
read the front plate first if that one
 
06:44:41.330 --> 06:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
plate is legible they use that plate and
 
06:44:43.548 --> 06:44:43.558 align:start position:0%
it's 60 of the time
 
06:44:45.650 --> 06:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
you know that front plate is used the
 
06:44:48.830 --> 06:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
other 40 the rear plate is used so
 
06:44:50.448 --> 06:44:50.458 align:start position:0%
um in those cases where the rear plate
 
06:44:53.030 --> 06:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
is used I can't say that the plate
 
06:44:55.490 --> 06:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
was illegible and we haven't done that
 
06:44:58.310 --> 06:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
level of analysis analysis
 
06:45:01.310 --> 06:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
okay did you want to follow up
 
06:45:01.320 --> 06:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
okay did you want to follow up
again

06:45:03.900 --> 06:45:03.910 align:start position:0%
again
 
06:45:03.910 --> 06:45:09.368 align:start position:0%
again

06:45:16.390 --> 06:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
I did not receive a copy of Mr
 
06:45:19.010 --> 06:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
Washington's uh testimony so I'm
 
06:45:19.020 --> 06:45:21.890 align:start position:0%
Washington's uh testimony so I'm
wondering

06:45:21.890 --> 06:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:23.628 --> 06:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to confirm we're going to
 
06:45:25.310 --> 06:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
talk with uh and I don't even know if
 
06:45:26.390 --> 06:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
anybody can hear him anymore at this
 
06:45:28.190 --> 06:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
point I'll be talking with our
 
06:45:30.230 --> 06:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
researcher and maybe staff to find out
 
06:45:32.390 --> 06:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
figure out the best way to make sure
 
06:45:34.850 --> 06:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
that committee members are getting all
 
06:45:37.490 --> 06:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
this literature all this testimony I'm
 
06:45:38.990 --> 06:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
not sure exactly what these are going to
 
06:45:40.190 --> 06:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
do it right now that's why I'll get some
 
06:45:43.990 --> 06:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
advice and reach out to everybody later
 
06:45:47.868 --> 06:45:47.878 align:start position:0%
uh representative Walsh I do have
 
06:45:49.788 --> 06:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
um his testimony it was emailed to the
 
06:45:51.708 --> 06:45:51.718 align:start position:0%
full committee um however if some

that has signed up for this bill
 
06:47:54.288 --> 06:47:54.298 align:start position:0%

06:47:56.090 --> 06:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill
 
06:48:01.070 --> 06:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:03.830 --> 06:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
um before we go again like I said we'll
 
06:48:05.810 --> 06:48:05.820 align:start position:0%
get this result with the emails
 
06:48:07.968 --> 06:48:07.978 align:start position:0%
uh and I thank you for your patience
 
06:48:10.610 --> 06:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
today with some of the downtime again I
 
06:48:11.810 --> 06:48:11.820 align:start position:0%
had a change of plans whether it's
 
06:48:11.820 --> 06:48:13.030 align:start position:0%
had a change of plans whether it's
exciting

06:48:13.030 --> 06:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
exciting
 
06:48:15.048 --> 06:48:15.058 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:48:17.330 --> 06:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
to be honest because you did not know
 
06:48:20.090 --> 06:48:20.100 align:start position:0%
how it was going to go day one with this
 
06:48:22.310 --> 06:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
this whole hybrid system I think it
 
06:48:23.690 --> 06:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
might actually better better than I
 
06:48:25.548 --> 06:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
thought it was so yes things should uh
 
06:48:27.770 --> 06:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
get a little bit smoother next week the
 
06:48:30.230 --> 06:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
girls I kept them mostly had a half an
 
06:48:32.150 --> 06:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
hour piece again but yeah a little more
 
06:48:34.548 --> 06:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
substantive so it's just like they're
 
06:48:37.250 --> 06:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
not going to have as much downtime
 
06:48:39.288 --> 06:48:39.298 align:start position:0%
I don't know the down times better than
 
06:48:41.208 --> 06:48:41.218 align:start position:0%
being three hours behind because I've
 
06:48:43.730 --> 06:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
been there and that is not a lot of fun
 
06:48:46.190 --> 06:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh next week we will certainly be doing
 
06:48:47.990 --> 06:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
executive session if you notice the
 
06:48:49.490 --> 06:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
calendar is the last thing I think I
 
06:48:51.708 --> 06:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 215 don't quickly on that
 
06:48:54.170 --> 06:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
but uh that's not due end of our day we
 
06:48:57.010 --> 06:48:57.020 align:start position:0%
will go into exact session uh after uh
 
06:49:00.170 --> 06:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
next week the most part it'll be the
 
06:49:01.850 --> 06:49:01.860 align:start position:0%
bills we've dealt with today
 
06:49:04.628 --> 06:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
so unless there's any questions
 
06:49:07.610 --> 06:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
we're good
 
06:49:07.620 --> 06:49:10.330 align:start position:0%
we're good
so

06:49:10.330 --> 06:49:10.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:14.090 --> 06:49:14.100 align:start position:0%
thanks everybody and have a good
 
06:49:14.100 --> 06:49:16.638 align:start position:0%
thanks everybody and have a good
hmm
