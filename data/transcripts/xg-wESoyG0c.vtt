00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
get the subcommittee started
 
00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
on SB 53 permitting the use of certain
 
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 align:start position:0%
refrigerants that are in compliance with
 
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
a Clean Air Act as we get started I just
 
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
kind of like to throw out I think
 
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
there's a few things that we're looking
 
00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
for insight on and we've got gentlemen
 
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
here to speak to it this morning one is
 
00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's any concern with
 
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
the overall policy two
 
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.330 align:start position:0%
the overall policy two
um

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
I am I'll be looking for some guidance
 
00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
on line six which has provided that any
 
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
equipment containing such refrigerant
 
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
shall be listed and installed in
 
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
accordance with safety standards and use
 
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
conditions imposed pursuant to such
 
00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
designation where those safety standards
 
00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
coming from who's implementing them
 
00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 align:start position:0%
seems a little bit big to me personally
 
00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
but I would like to start the
 
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting by welcoming Sean
 
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
Timmy to just give some information on
 
00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
where the fire marshal is kind of
 
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 align:start position:0%
sorry to surprise you that's okay good
 
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
morning State Fire Marshal
 
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
um thanks for having me here this
 
00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
morning uh so I I was just for some
 
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
background we were asked for some fiscal
 
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.850 align:start position:0%
background we were asked for some fiscal
note

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 align:start position:0%
note
 
00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 align:start position:0%
um just for asked about a fiscal note
 
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 align:start position:0%
when this came through initially uh we
 
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
looked at it and uh initiated that sir
 
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 align:start position:0%
said there was no fiscal impact that we
 
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
saw and then also that in our review we
 
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
didn't have any major concerns with the
 
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
bill as was written at that time uh
 
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 align:start position:0%
and then I know last week I was at the
 
00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
National Fire Academy at a State Fire
 
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
Marshal Symposium that they held and I
 
00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
know that you guys heard the bill and
 
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
there's some questions came up from our
 
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
about I guess our we had concerns about
 
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
it from the state fire code perspective
 
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
I think the the only
 
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
um I would say journaling probably not
 
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
major concerns at all
 
00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
the the probably the only gist of uh
 
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
that on the fire code side is the the
 
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
use of refrigerants uh the newer
 
00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
refrigerants aren't
 
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
totally addressed in the current code in
 
00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 align:start position:0%
our eight 2018 codes today right and I
 
00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 align:start position:0%
think you heard some testimony the other
 
00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 align:start position:0%
day I listened to the the hearing that
 
00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
the the codes aren't going to catch up
 
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
for a while right so
 
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
on the fire code side one thing that I I
 
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 align:start position:0%
thought we could do is in the NFPA 55
 
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
which talks about some of the
 
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
refrigerant language the 23 edition of
 
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
NFPA 55 uh has the language on the fire
 
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
code side to address it so we could we
 
00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 align:start position:0%
could pull that in uh if we wanted to on
 
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
through the board of fog Control process
 
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
and then bring it forward through
 
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
ratification uh to the journal Court
 
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
um the way the board of Fire Control
 
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
works is that we can actually enact it
 
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
as soon as it's gone through the board
 
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
Fire Control and just needs a
 
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
ratification within a year so if there
 
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
was an eminent concern we could probably
 
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
get it addressed in by June uh speaking
 
00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
with NFPA the engineers down at NFPA
 
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
though the really the the there's no
 
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
major concern from what we could tell
 
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
for refrigerants in quantities less than
 
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
ten thousand pounds in
 
00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 align:start position:0%
um non-protected structure so typically
 
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
a non-sprinkled building you start
 
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
putting a Sprinkle system in and other
 
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
Protections in buildings you're talking
 
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
20 upwards of 40 000 pounds of the of or
 
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
the refrigerant products which is huge
 
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.149 align:start position:0%
the refrigerant products which is huge
numbers

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 align:start position:0%
um so the the advice that I was given
 
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
through National Fire Protection
 
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
Association Association FBA is that
 
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 align:start position:0%
there's really no you shouldn't really
 
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
have a major concern and then they would
 
00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
quickly remind which I you know very
 
00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 align:start position:0%
familiar with that there's alternative
 
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
means in in the code that
 
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
if someone were to present a new type
 
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
facility or a use that had in quantities
 
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 align:start position:0%
and those large quantities we can look
 
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
at it and and go ahead to the newer
 
00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
codes and the new guidance that's out
 
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
there and use that as you know work with
 
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
the developers to to achieve any
 
00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 align:start position:0%
additional protection that's needed so
 
00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
um you know that their refrigerant so
 
00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 align:start position:0%
they're still flammable
 
00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 align:start position:0%
um you know there's still there's
 
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
ammonias and propanes and different
 
00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
things that are used for flammables
 
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me for refrigerants out there but
 
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
the newer as as I understand all the
 
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
research I've been able to do in the
 
00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 align:start position:0%
last week or so especially is that the
 
00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
newer refrigerants are a little bit less
 
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
flammable than what um you know that
 
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing uh out there now
 
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
um so I mean I in my head that I I think
 
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to stand in the way of
 
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
the Clean Air stuff I think we have a
 
00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
couple different means and opportunities
 
00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 align:start position:0%
to get to where we need to if we're in
 
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
those large large quantities
 
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
um the way that I understand that the
 
00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 align:start position:0%
bill is written
 
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
uh you know we're in some conversation
 
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
came out like our our home refrigerators
 
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
or our conditioner units units those are
 
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
very small quantities of a refrigerant
 
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
and they have to meet listing standards
 
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's UL or FM or the other
 
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's a number of nationally
 
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 align:start position:0%
recognized testing Labs out there that
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
list all of our many of our appliances
 
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's computers or you know the
 
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
refrigerators or microwaves or different
 
00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 align:start position:0%
things like that or surge protectors for
 
00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 align:start position:0%
instance right so they need to meet
 
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
those standards as I understand it
 
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
um and I think there's a gentleman here
 
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
that knows the refrigerant side very
 
00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 align:start position:0%
that I I immerse myself from a
 
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
refrigerant in the last week it's
 
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
probably something I've not done in my
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
to over 20-year career in fire
 
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
protection engineering work but
 
00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 align:start position:0%
um you know I think the bottom line is
 
00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:23.150 align:start position:0%
um you know I think the bottom line is
that

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
um I feel pretty comfortable uh moving
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
forward with it
 
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
um you know recognizing there's a
 
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 align:start position:0%
federal need to move forward and help
 
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
cleaner air and things like that and I
 
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
think we have means to address it I I
 
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
think my ask is that um
 
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
if we Sunset the bill or when we catch
 
00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 align:start position:0%
up and the stuff's in the code properly
 
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
right so uh I think I can get stuff in
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
the fire code probably by the end of the
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
year I think on the building code side
 
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
it's probably going to take a little bit
 
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
longer but we also have a means on the
 
00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
building code side too and I'll let Phil
 
00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
Sherman as the chair of the building
 
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
code review board speak but
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
um there's a means there that they can
 
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
get amendments in so we could take those
 
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
24 language and Pull It in sooner into
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
the 2018 codes and get it ratified so
 
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
I've been babbling a bit I think but I
 
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
think uh you know I I feel pretty
 
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable with where we're at I just I
 
00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 align:start position:0%
guess I I reiterate my ask would be as
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
if we if we land on something like this
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
now as we just Sunset it so that it
 
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
allows time for the January 1st deadline
 
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
for the federal standards on the Clean
 
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
Air side for us to get caught up a
 
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
little bit in our codes I think that's
 
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
really the Crux of the problems I've
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
talked to some of my counterparts across
 
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
the country is that we you haven't had
 
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
time to catch up really catch up on the
 
00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
codes code officials tend to be very
 
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
black and white and if it's not
 
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
explicitly written in the code that
 
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes we're reluctant to look at the
 
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
newer Technologies so
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
okay happy dance try to answer some
 
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from the
 
00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:00.290 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from the
subcommittee

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
yeah representative true thank you Mr
 
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
chair when you say uh uh your uh uh
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
looking for it to be sunset you mean the
 
00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
effective date is that what you
 
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
did I know I would think that we could
 
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
put some language in and I I haven't I
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
don't have it off the top of my head but
 
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
once we say once we have the 20 say the
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
24 edition of the code in place as our
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
State Building Code this this section
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
would be go away or would be repealed
 
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
essentially I don't know if that's the
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
proper way to do it or if we would catch
 
00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
it later but I think I
 
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
one of the things in practice that's
 
00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
difficult is we we've worked very hard
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
over the last few years to have a State
 
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
Building Code and a state fire code and
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
have a good process that
 
00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:43.139 align:start position:0%
um the building code review board the
 
00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
board of fire controls do all their
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
research and their homework and bring a
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
package to uh the house and the Senate
 
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
and say this is what we feel is good uh
 
00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
for the state with the appropriate New
 
00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire amendments and we ratify it
 
00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
and then so we have the the model codes
 
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
which are the published nationally we
 
00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:04.259 align:start position:0%
make some New Hampshire changes we
 
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
codify that in a rule
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
um you you ratify it and you know anyone
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
working within the state or out of the
 
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
state can come and say oh this is an
 
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire building code this is an
 
00:08:16.249 --> 00:08:16.259 align:start position:0%
answer fire code these are the New
 
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire amendments
 
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:20.220 align:start position:0%
uh We've also gone to the next step in
 
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
some legislation recently that we are
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
working very hard to put all the local
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
amendments together too so anyone comes
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
in can say State Building Code State
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
amendments oh I want to work in Concord
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
here's the Concord amendments and it's
 
00:08:35.209 --> 00:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
very clean so I think when we start we
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
hear the confusions when we bury some
 
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
stuff in legislation and bury some stuff
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
in the code amendment process the design
 
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
World finds it a little bit clunky a
 
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
little bit harder to follow so they ask
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
that we've been trying to do is if if we
 
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
can when we can is any code Amendment
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
related stuff stays in the code
 
00:08:56.329 --> 00:08:56.339 align:start position:0%
amendment process does that make sense
 
00:08:59.630 --> 00:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I appreciate you
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
coming today absolutely
 
00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
all right um Philip Sherman building
 
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:23.220 align:start position:0%
uh just here and then representative
 
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.130 align:start position:0%
uh just here and then representative
Gerhart

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:27.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
12 I think you're here just for fun
 
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:44.750 align:start position:0%
12 I think you're here just for fun
hmm

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I've taken the
 
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
liberty of just sort of putting my
 
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
thoughts down uh this may or may not
 
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:56.220 align:start position:0%
turn into something formal I I find in
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
my own mind that this is a little bit of
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
a solution looking for a problem in that
 
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:01.740 align:start position:0%
in conversations with your
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative Simon it's not that
 
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
anybody is trying to prohibit these it's
 
00:10:07.329 --> 00:10:07.339 align:start position:0%
sort of just in case
 
00:10:11.329 --> 00:10:11.339 align:start position:0%
so one we have a sort of a board bias
 
00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
that we would prefer to keep
 
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
administrative type rules on the code
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
side not written into law we have four
 
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
or five sections of 155 a currently that
 
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
deal with specific issues and 50 percent
 
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
of them are stale out of date and
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
probably just need to be repealed in
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
other words the codes the model codes
 
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
have caught up they've dealt with them
 
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
no no big problem
 
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
what I would like to to propose is that
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
we have a way to tag on the 2024 cycle
 
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
of amendments it's 20 pages long because
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
they have to get into a bunch of
 
00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:49.220 align:start position:0%
different sections and different codes
 
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
into our 2018 code amendment process we
 
00:10:56.449 --> 00:10:56.459 align:start position:0%
have a hearing tomorrow with with Edna
 
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:03.140 align:start position:0%
sanity DNA on is it hb564 yeah 541 564.
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
564 to Simply ratify I think there's
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
eight amendments there that are working
 
00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:10.579 align:start position:0%
their way through the process
 
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
we can bring the 2024 amendments to our
 
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
Board second week of April next week at
 
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
our monthly meeting I have a public
 
00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:22.019 align:start position:0%
hearing second week of May at our normal
 
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
monthly hearing and then tag this on if
 
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
we can get the
 
00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:29.459 align:start position:0%
Edna and related folks to to be able to
 
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
deal with that then in June
 
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
everything going according to plan
 
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
effectively they'd come into effect
 
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
around July first you know with
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
Governor's signature so that's my
 
00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:41.779 align:start position:0%
preferred route
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
if you really really really need to have
 
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
a bill I've taken the liberty of trying
 
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
to mark up what's here now and it may it
 
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:53.300 align:start position:0%
may look like clarification although as
 
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:56.220 align:start position:0%
fire marshal to me indicates these
 
00:11:57.889 --> 00:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
things have a bad habit of turning into
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
black and white so simply indicating
 
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
that we use the term municipal building
 
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
code amendments that's just editorial
 
00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:08.459 align:start position:0%
but then to clarify that these need to
 
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
meet the New Hampshire State Fire and
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
Building Codes
 
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
referencing safety standards and I'm not
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
an expert on the Federal Regulations but
 
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
when I looked at it it looked like there
 
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
was a bit of a round robin where they
 
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
were they say meet the local building
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
codes but if the local building codes
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
don't have Provisions this bill would
 
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
allow someone to essentially come in and
 
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
not meet any standards so there there is
 
00:12:35.449 --> 00:12:35.459 align:start position:0%
a lack there until we get these
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
amendments written into into our code
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
which can happen I think
 
00:12:42.889 --> 00:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
relatively quickly
 
00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:46.139 align:start position:0%
so that that's my two options preferred
 
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
let us just do the amendment thing give
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
us some assistance you know getting
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
behind it and then uh I don't know if
 
00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:54.779 align:start position:0%
the proper word was sunset I use the
 
00:12:56.569 --> 00:12:56.579 align:start position:0%
word kill but you can put the right
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
legal term on that uh but if if we need
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
to keep this bill going uh amend it so
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
that it clearly requires compliance with
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
the state codes and doesn't leave any
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
gray areas there
 
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
so that's what I had to say about that
 
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
any questions from the subcommittee
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
I can
 
00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:22.430 align:start position:0%
I can
um

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.769 --> 00:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
you don't see a need for this this bill
 
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
not only don't I see a need for it
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
historically when we write code language
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
into state law things get stale
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
at one day there was a big discussion
 
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
about why we had to have this code
 
00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:46.139 align:start position:0%
specific code on log structures
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
every model code in the country
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
references that code now it's just stale
 
00:13:52.449 --> 00:13:52.459 align:start position:0%
there's no need for that legislation
 
00:13:55.129 --> 00:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
what happens when a code goes into
 
00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
legislation is everybody's hands are
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
tied there's no appeals there's no
 
00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
ability to work with existing conditions
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
there's no ability to to deal with
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
special conditions that the code didn't
 
00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
didn't address and local officials all
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
they can do is just say That's the Law
 
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:14.220 align:start position:0%
go do it so if I can just interject
 
00:14:15.949 --> 00:14:15.959 align:start position:0%
because it was kind of my idea
 
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:17.300 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
they'd really like to get the stuff into
 
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
code and we think we may have a way of
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
doing it with 564. I talked with
 
00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:24.290 align:start position:0%
doing it with 564. I talked with
um

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.050 align:start position:0%
um
senator

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:28.740 align:start position:0%
um Pearl this morning who's the head of
 
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
Senate Edna they have 564 coming before
 
00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:34.139 align:start position:0%
them tomorrow and if we could amend 564
 
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
to add the code that's necessary to take
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
care of this we could have that done
 
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
hopefully by June which would meet our
 
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.810 align:start position:0%
hopefully by June which would meet our
deadlines

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
deadlines
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
um I had just come up with the idea of
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
potentially passing this with a sunset
 
00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
clause in it as kind of a stop gap
 
00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
between now and when they got that into
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
code but that when they did get it into
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
code this would just Sunset and go away
 
00:14:56.689 --> 00:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
so that wasn't in statute but it was in
 
00:14:59.470 --> 00:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
the building code if that makes sense
 
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
go ahead and thank you thank you Mr
 
00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.129 align:start position:0%
go ahead and thank you thank you Mr
chair

00:15:04.129 --> 00:15:04.139 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
um I believe the state biomass was
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
saying I think you're saying the same
 
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.230 align:start position:0%
saying I think you're saying the same
thing

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
you don't like
 
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
things to be in code in and out of
 
00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.610 align:start position:0%
things to be in code in and out of
essays

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
because it limits
 
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.730 align:start position:0%
because it limits
correct

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
okay so uh the thing is uh I'm very much
 
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
in favor of the idea of having the
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
people who are most knowledgeable and
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
also to some degree most flexible which
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
would be the building code review board
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
and so forth the people who are most
 
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable and most involved to have
 
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
them be the people where the rubber
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
meets the road I don't like locking
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
things up in statute if you don't have
 
00:15:57.009 --> 00:15:57.019 align:start position:0%
to because as a building co-chair
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
Sherman has just said
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
it locks you in in a situation where uh
 
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
you can't easily change it you're stuck
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
with it so the the question I have is
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
whether this has been discussed with the
 
00:16:15.009 --> 00:16:15.019 align:start position:0%
chairman Maguire because she is
 
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
extremely knowledgeable uh from her
 
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
professional background but also from
 
00:16:23.329 --> 00:16:23.339 align:start position:0%
having been the chair or a ranking
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
member on this committee for years
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
um and and and because she has that
 
00:16:32.569 --> 00:16:32.579 align:start position:0%
level of expertise and familiarity with
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
all of this uh I'd like to know that
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
that she's been consulted conferred with
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
and that she's on board
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
um so the the conversation that I have
 
00:16:43.249 --> 00:16:43.259 align:start position:0%
had with her I haven't talked to her at
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
length about this particular proposal of
 
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.490 align:start position:0%
length about this particular proposal of
564.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
564.
 
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
um but she was just concerned that there
 
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
were concerns by the building code
 
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
review board or the fire marshal with
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
the actual refrigerants themselves which
 
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
there don't seem to be and I think she's
 
00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
probably okay with that at this point
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
but as far as the overall scheme we'll
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
still run that past her
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
um before we move forward to see if she
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
has any input into it for sure good well
 
00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:09.299 align:start position:0%
I mean the thing is what the fire
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
marshal was saying earlier in his
 
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
testimony was that that the concern that
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
I voiced and I wasn't the only one with
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
regard to the flammability issue uh but
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
to the degree that uh that the uh the
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
flammability is apparently is not really
 
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
a problem with this uh it's uh the
 
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
current the hfcs are somewhat flammable
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
I I didn't know that but then I have no
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
technical background in all of this uh
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
but uh that the family of the issue is
 
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
not an issue it's not a concern in terms
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
of going backwards uh and Fire Marshal
 
00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
is saying that that we want to get in
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
line with uh the incoming Federal
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
requirements and so forth which are move
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
in the right direction for environmental
 
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
concerns and so forth uh so I think that
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
my concern has gone away on that and to
 
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
the guru we have a better process which
 
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
I think is what chairman Sherman is
 
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
talking about a better process overall
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
than as long as as Carol McGuire's on
 
00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
board I'm on board
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
um yes go ahead representative Schmidt
 
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
if I could just clarify it's not that
 
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
these are not flammable that they're
 
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
less flammable uh the codes still have
 
00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:33.539 align:start position:0%
restrictions especially as the fire
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
marshal said at larger quantities and
 
00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:37.460 align:start position:0%
there are some very large refrigeration
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
systems out there universities hospitals
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
industrial sites and so forth uh so
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
there are requirements that need to come
 
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
into play here and the the Gap with this
 
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
bill is it's this round robin where the
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
feds represent the state but when you go
 
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
to the state there's nothing there yet
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
but the bill would say go ahead and use
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
this stuff so that's that's the Gap that
 
00:19:03.169 --> 00:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
we're trying to close
 
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you now our ultimate deadline
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
for this was July of 24 is that correct
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
all right so we do have until July of
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
24. are we going to have to overly Rush
 
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
the process to get it into code to get
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
it into 564 or will it have the a
 
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:19.740 align:start position:0%
reasonable vetting process as far as the
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
building vote code review board is
 
00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:24.299 align:start position:0%
concerned and our esteemed chair is she
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
going to be comfortable with that
 
00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
speed of process
 
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
by July of 2024 everything going
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
according to plan we should be on the
 
00:19:39.049 --> 00:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
2021 codes and we can easily wrap these
 
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
amendments into that process which were
 
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:44.220 align:start position:0%
in the cycle of now uh what I'm
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
proposing is that we can get that into
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
the hopper for the 2018 code which is
 
00:19:51.169 --> 00:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
already in effect in New Hampshire and
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
we've got some additional amendments
 
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
working its way through the system with
 
00:19:57.049 --> 00:19:57.059 align:start position:0%
the hearing tomorrow right that was my
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
question though as opposed to trying to
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
get it connected to 564 and getting it
 
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
into the 2018 code is that going to be
 
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
overly rushed because we have until 2024
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass something like this
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
as a stop gap between now and when you
 
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
finish the process is it easier to give
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
you the extra time to get the job done
 
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
it's certainly easier but I don't know
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
is overly rushed everything gets overly
 
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
rushed as the things come to a head sure
 
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
at the end of the session right so okay
 
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.750 align:start position:0%
at the end of the session right so okay
great

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative goalie thank you
 
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I guess my question goes to
 
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
do we need to
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
do anything regarding this in 564 or use
 
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
what the vehicle we have in front of us
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
that has already come forward with the
 
00:20:45.169 --> 00:20:45.179 align:start position:0%
changes made
 
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
uh what was that again sorry
 
00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
do we need to
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
really worry about trying to get this
 
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
into 564 versus using the vehicle we
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
have here in front of us and taking care
 
00:20:58.970 --> 00:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
of the issue right here
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
instead of yeah I mean that would be the
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
other issue would just be to hang on to
 
00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:06.539 align:start position:0%
this bill and attach the link well
 
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
yeah because either way you're going to
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
end up in a committee conference with it
 
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be a separate
 
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:12.830 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be a separate
um

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
well if this is a separate Standalone
 
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
the Senate agrees it won't be a
 
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
committee conference I'm sure it's
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
agreed to so if it's everything I'm just
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
suggesting it might be easier this is a
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
separate issue then putting it in
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that Mr Sherman
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
one one of the problems one of the
 
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
problems one of the tasks that's in
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
front of us is that because we're on the
 
00:21:34.799 --> 00:21:35.890 align:start position:0%
front of us is that because we're on the
2018

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:35.900 align:start position:0%
2018
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
Mechanical Code and building code
 
00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
the amendments are written by the model
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
code folks against the 2021 code so if
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to put this in as an
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to the 2018 code we need to
 
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
add in the changes that occurred at the
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
model code level between 18 and 21 to
 
00:21:57.169 --> 00:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
then modify them essentially again with
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
the proposed package so the package is
 
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
not written in a form that we can simply
 
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:04.340 align:start position:0%
pick it up and reference it right now
 
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
furthermore the model codes there are
 
00:22:09.049 --> 00:22:09.059 align:start position:0%
two fire codes New Hampshire is on the
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
nfba code there's also an international
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
code council code there are amendments
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
to the international fire code which
 
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
does not apply in New Hampshire and we
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
need to work with the Fireside to be
 
00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
sure that there isn't something there
 
00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:24.539 align:start position:0%
that needs to be patched up on the fire
 
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
side because both both cycles of code
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
deal with flammable refrigerants they
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
um so I guess my concern is tagging to
 
00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:45.059 align:start position:0%
564 because we know that that's we've
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
it's already been through the Full House
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's passed it's it's nice and clean
 
00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
it's been thought out worked on for a
 
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
while and for building fire code stuff
 
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't be a bit surprised if it's
 
00:22:57.529 --> 00:22:57.539 align:start position:0%
exact tomorrow because it's it should be
 
00:22:59.930 --> 00:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
no issue at all and I guess my concern
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
is where there's so many questions about
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
this if we tag it into a very clean bill
 
00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
that will likely pass I would be very
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
concerned about losing all of our hard
 
00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
work on ratification of all those other
 
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
building code amendments and fire code
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
amendments because those we've already
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
established are good for New Hampshire
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
we need them like if they've already
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
been vetted through and I think if I
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
understand the schedule right you guys
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
will know better than I am but if we're
 
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
I think the building code review board
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
meeting is June 9th which is after some
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
of the deadlines if I'm not mistaken
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I had to go back and check the
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
deadlines if it was in May I think we
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
had plenty of time but if we're
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
stretched out to June that might be a
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
little late I'd uh I'd love to try to
 
00:23:42.529 --> 00:23:42.539 align:start position:0%
stick with amending this work within
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
this bill if we can rather than I don't
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
say yeah I think that's representative
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
goalie's point and I don't unless
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with the building code
 
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
review board I'm not sure that I have a
 
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:52.740 align:start position:0%
problem with that I just had another
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
idea forgive me one way to do this would
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
be an amend it the way I indicate or
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
something similar to clearly reference
 
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:01.860 align:start position:0%
the state codes but then make it
 
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
effective July 1st of 2024 because that
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
would give us time to put it into the
 
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
2021 Hopper out it comes and at that
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
point we'd have state
 
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
code requirements again I don't disagree
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
with the with the potential upset the
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
apple cart with 564. it's simply that
 
00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:24.299 align:start position:0%
right now there's no requirements the
 
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:26.220 align:start position:0%
code prohibits it
 
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
this would permit it but it wouldn't
 
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.570 align:start position:0%
 
Jeff

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
my question I guess goes back to
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
listening to the fire marshal earlier
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't this be taken care of in the
 
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
I can get it at the June Board of Fire
 
00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:54.980 align:start position:0%
Control and bring in an NFPA 55 and I
 
00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
the research that I did nfba 855 I'm
 
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
sorry wrong one NFP 55
 
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
um the language in there it matches the
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
language in the ICC language uh and I
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
booked maybe one of these guys a little
 
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
bit there they've been in the weeds of
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
this far longer than I have but I think
 
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
um that path I mean the board of Fire
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
Control we get a that specific section
 
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
put into place in their June meeting and
 
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
then it would be in effect and then you
 
00:25:27.049 --> 00:25:27.059 align:start position:0%
you guys we would ask for ratification
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
within the ratification bill for next
 
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.890 align:start position:0%
within the ratification bill for next
session

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
um and that would be that would cover it
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
we'd be well before the January 1st
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
deadline that the Clean Air Act stuff
 
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
needs to meet and it would be in the
 
00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
fire code there would be a gap on the
 
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
building code side that but typically in
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
the statute the the you know won the
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
stricter one typically applies so I
 
00:25:48.409 --> 00:25:48.419 align:start position:0%
think we have some protections the other
 
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:50.700 align:start position:0%
asked if I don't know if the gentleman
 
00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
behind me can answer it but the you know
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
the what I was told by a couple of
 
00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
Engineers that on the nfpsi and the ICC
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
side is that there's when they surveyed
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
the country that the the number of
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
people that would have these quantities
 
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
would we wouldn't be even tripping
 
00:26:09.049 --> 00:26:09.059 align:start position:0%
against some of these thresholds that
 
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
are there I mean we have to put them in
 
00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
place just in case the large
 
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility or you know large
 
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
facilities go into play but you know I
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I think it's almost to
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
me it's a little bit of the fear of the
 
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
unknown right that
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
um we're kind of a lot of the what ifs
 
00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.630 align:start position:0%
um we're kind of a lot of the what ifs
but

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm putting a little bit of
 
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
trust in I think the process that you
 
00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
know the the a couple of experts that I
 
00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:36.299 align:start position:0%
talked to have said that we have good
 
00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
paths to go there I agree with that
 
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
through the alternative design process
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
if something came in tomorrow I I feel
 
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
pretty comfortable that we could address
 
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.049 align:start position:0%
pretty comfortable that we could address
it

00:26:45.049 --> 00:26:45.059 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:26:45.059 --> 00:26:45.830 align:start position:0%
it
um

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
you know and I I don't know that's I'm
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
starting to babble a little bit sorry
 
00:26:51.289 --> 00:26:51.299 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think the other thing that
 
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
hasn't come into the conversation yet
 
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
that is part of the conversation is
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
industry and industries concerns that
 
00:26:59.450 --> 00:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
there's just something in place that
 
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
ensures them that they can move forward
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
and continue to produce while we're
 
00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
working out all the details
 
00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:06.529 align:start position:0%
working out all the details
um

00:27:06.529 --> 00:27:06.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
and I'm just reminded by the nodding
 
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
heads in the background that that's um
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns so
 
00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
I'm I guess personally I'm still maybe
 
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
inclined to say if we put something into
 
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
statute with a sunset clause for now so
 
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
that there's something in place give you
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
guys the next year to work out all the
 
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
building code stuff bring it back to us
 
00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
in legislation next year for
 
00:27:33.169 --> 00:27:33.179 align:start position:0%
consideration you know as far as
 
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
adjusting it to meet these standards we
 
00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
can get the codes in place before you
 
00:27:42.649 --> 00:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
know June of next year 2024 and then
 
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
this would just Sunset and disappear and
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
then we would just have the codes the
 
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
way that we want it
 
00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.250 align:start position:0%
way that we want it
um

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
I still think maybe the the best route
 
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
to go for now because we're these things
 
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
aren't going to start pumping into the
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
state before then anyway correct are
 
00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.350 align:start position:0%
state before then anyway correct are
they

00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.310 align:start position:0%
they
necessarily

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:04.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
right but there's no need for it and
 
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
before then correct well actually if
 
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
sorry guys if we could switch real quick
 
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna bring him up all three of us
 
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
well we could throw them on uh on a mic
 
00:28:21.049 --> 00:28:21.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
okay good morning everybody I'm Mike
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
nerosi I'm the director of government
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
Affairs 4-H or I the uh we represent all
 
00:28:29.149 --> 00:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers of HVAC refrigeration
 
00:28:30.649 --> 00:28:30.659 align:start position:0%
and water heating equipment in North
 
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
America we produce about 90 percent of
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
all the equipment that both commercially
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
and residential here in the US
 
00:28:38.159 --> 00:28:39.470 align:start position:0%
and residential here in the US
um

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing is it for us right now
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
is certainty so we're as the chairman
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned July 1 2024 is when the EPA is
 
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
going to begin phasing down the use of
 
00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.010 align:start position:0%
going to begin phasing down the use of
hydrofluorocarbons

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
hydrofluorocarbons
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
um immediately by restricting the
 
00:28:59.090 --> 00:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
existing Supply by 40 percent
 
00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:01.740 align:start position:0%
the reason why we can't wait till July
 
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
2024 is because our manufacturers have
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
you know supply chain you know they need
 
00:29:09.529 --> 00:29:09.539 align:start position:0%
to get things figured out ahead of time
 
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
they can't just in one month all of a
 
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
sudden divert equipment that's now
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
suddenly approved in New Hampshire
 
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
you know there could be scarcity
 
00:29:18.649 --> 00:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
problems and it may take a while to
 
00:29:21.289 --> 00:29:21.299 align:start position:0%
reallocate resources around
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
um we really just would you know this
 
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
legislation as I think others had
 
00:29:27.049 --> 00:29:27.059 align:start position:0%
mentioned representative goalie you know
 
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
it's it's very straightforward we are
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
fine with a a sunset if that's you know
 
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
we don't oppose that at all if it's tied
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
to when the new 2024 codes are adopted
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
um but at the end of the day you know
 
00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:45.059 align:start position:0%
being asked to we've been working on
 
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
this across the entire country right so
 
00:29:48.649 --> 00:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
in many states we've been asked to just
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
trust the process with the code process
 
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
right I'll give you an example in
 
00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:54.620 align:start position:0%
Georgia we've submitted four different
 
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
proposals to adopt these codes in
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
Georgia and all four were rejected
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
and and a lot of it comes from that well
 
00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
we're on 2018 and that's 2024 we're
 
00:30:06.649 --> 00:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
getting way too ahead of ourselves it's
 
00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
like well wait this is a special
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
situation where the federal government
 
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
is mandating that we move to these new
 
00:30:15.049 --> 00:30:15.059 align:start position:0%
refrigerants and we don't have time to
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
and and to sit and go through the
 
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
building code process extremely as the
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
gentleman said I mean everything go if
 
00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
everything goes according to plan I mean
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
I've seen the plan go out the window
 
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
I've been working on this for six months
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
now the plan almost always goes out the
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
window because then somebody else is
 
00:30:33.649 --> 00:30:33.659 align:start position:0%
introduced into the process they say
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
well wait a second I got a question on
 
00:30:36.769 --> 00:30:36.779 align:start position:0%
this I got it and it just gets even more
 
00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:39.539 align:start position:0%
messy so I'm a quick quick question
 
00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
though for clarification and I think
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
this is the main thing that we're trying
 
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
to sort out if we were to pass a piece
 
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
of legislation like the legislations
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's sitting before us we could
 
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
start selling that refrigerant unless
 
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
it's effective in the future immediately
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
without the code in place correct yes
 
00:30:58.490 --> 00:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
right so I think that that's the main
 
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
concern that everybody's trying to
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
balance is
 
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
getting something in place so that you
 
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
have the assurance that you need that
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
you are going to be able to sell and
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
that you know but what's the what's the
 
00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
best timetable that we can take to make
 
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
sure that all of the boxes are checked
 
00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
so that when we start selling we also
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
have the code in place to facilitate
 
00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
that yes yes I understand that okay so
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
that that makes sense though so
 
00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
um yes representative gerhardt thank you
 
00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:29.870 align:start position:0%
um yes representative gerhardt thank you
chair

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious as to
 
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
well I'm a little concerned about us
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
tying ourselves this strongly to the
 
00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
federal government so we have to now
 
00:31:39.529 --> 00:31:39.539 align:start position:0%
follow everything that they say is fine
 
00:31:42.049 --> 00:31:42.059 align:start position:0%
we say is fine we don't have any kind of
 
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
say so well I think it's on the road I
 
00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:45.539 align:start position:0%
think it's more so that the federal
 
00:31:48.169 --> 00:31:48.179 align:start position:0%
government is just restricting the
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
production of certain refrigerants that
 
00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:51.059 align:start position:0%
we use so we're not going to be able to
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
get them because people aren't going to
 
00:31:54.529 --> 00:31:54.539 align:start position:0%
be able to make them so this but it's
 
00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
also okay yeah so this is basically
 
00:31:58.970 --> 00:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
allowing us and and producing the code
 
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
to facilitate okay the new refrigerants
 
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:12.889 align:start position:0%
 
happens

00:32:12.889 --> 00:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
um so yes this uh hold on so
 
00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:17.220 align:start position:0%
as far as the states that have failed in
 
00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.169 align:start position:0%
as far as the states that have failed in
Kentucky

00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
Kentucky
 
00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
Georgia Virginia Idaho why is that
 
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
failed is this just simply bad
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats at work
 
00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
um well Kentucky quite honestly it was
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
very frustrating it was um I would say
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
more political
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
um than anything else I mean the
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
legislation was moving unanimously and
 
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
um we ended up they have a very short
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
session only a 30-day session we end up
 
00:32:42.289 --> 00:32:42.299 align:start position:0%
getting hung up in the Senate on the
 
00:32:45.169 --> 00:32:45.179 align:start position:0%
very last 11th Hour of the session and
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we couldn't couldn't get
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
it across in time and so now as a
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
fallback we're gonna have to work with
 
00:32:51.889 --> 00:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
the Department to try to find some sort
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
of emergency provision or some sort of
 
00:32:57.169 --> 00:32:57.179 align:start position:0%
administrative process in which we can
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
in which we can get this into effect and
 
00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
I think everybody was pretty
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
disappointed in Kentucky with the
 
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
outcome I think the the the legislative
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
leadership as well as now the governor's
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
office having to now instead of having a
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
clean bill that could have just now
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
we've got to revert back to trying to
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
find something that fits into the hole
 
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
that we can get
 
00:33:21.769 --> 00:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
stop Gap measure until they can get it
 
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
next session
 
00:33:25.009 --> 00:33:25.019 align:start position:0%
but they're not overly concerned about
 
00:33:25.019 --> 00:33:26.269 align:start position:0%
but they're not overly concerned about
it

00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
and it fails I mean they knew it was
 
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
going to fail what was their concern on
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
this I'm trying to get at what is the
 
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
issue is it simply people aren't meeting
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
deadlines it's just hard to believe
 
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
that's happening in that many states do
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean yeah no so a couple
 
00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:38.700 align:start position:0%
of states are are unique right so
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
Virginia are we do we went through the
 
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
normal code process cycle our proposals
 
00:33:45.169 --> 00:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
were adopted that's why it's in Orange
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
because we didn't pursue legislation
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
there in Georgia same thing we've had
 
00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:50.630 align:start position:0%
there in Georgia same thing we've had
our

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:33:51.889 --> 00:33:51.899 align:start position:0%
um codes
 
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
um approved by their DCA Department of
 
00:33:58.850 --> 00:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
Community Affairs and so that's why we
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
have that in Orange as well
 
00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:03.419 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate it I don't want to go
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
through it I appreciate it I'm just I'm
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
just curious as to why people would be
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to this that's what I'm doing
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
but there's there's really it's not
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
there's no opposition there's no formal
 
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
opposition that I've encountered and
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
across all these states 27 States I've
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
been working in
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
um it's just a matter of
 
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
um again it's it's a mismatch in timing
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
that's all it is between the federal
 
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
phase down and the building code cycle
 
00:34:24.649 --> 00:34:24.659 align:start position:0%
yeah it could well it could easily
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
happen here if we get bogged down in
 
00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:29.099 align:start position:0%
working between the senate or here and
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
timing doesn't work out or something
 
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:33.300 align:start position:0%
happens and then it just doesn't get
 
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
done and then we're orange yeah on the
 
00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:38.339 align:start position:0%
chart or red you don't want to go red
 
00:34:38.339 --> 00:34:43.389 align:start position:0%
chart or red you don't want to go red
yeah

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just going to say Mr chair I
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
mean you know I'm from Pennsylvania
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
um I worked for our legislature for a
 
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
number of years we were able to get that
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
into the statute last year worked with
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
our building code officials they were
 
00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
fine with it we really have not had much
 
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
any if all any pushback at all
 
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
um from building code officials once we
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
fully explain sort of again this
 
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
mismatch between the two and the
 
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
building code process again is so
 
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.910 align:start position:0%
building code process again is so
unpredictable

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
unpredictable
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
um in many of these states some we've
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
submitted six proposals already and
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
they've all been rejected because well
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
we're not working on that right now
 
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
we're working on this and it's you know
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
we would be fine if this legislation
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
would pass clean and if uh obviously
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
that'd be our preferred route but if if
 
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
it would want to be tied with a sunset
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
to win the 2024 ICC model codes are
 
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
adopted uh we have no problem with that
 
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
we have actually done that in one or two
 
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
other states
 
00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:35.750 align:start position:0%
other states
um

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh in fact in Pennsylvania is what we we
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
actually did that as well
 
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.230 align:start position:0%
actually did that as well
okay

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
um yes Mr Sherman come on back up
 
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.609 align:start position:0%
um yes Mr Sherman come on back up
foreign

00:35:48.609 --> 00:35:48.619 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
on my feet but I may have a solution
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
that fixes everybody's needs so ashrae
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
which is the American Society of heating
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
and Refrigeration if you want to munch a
 
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
little closer to the mic sorry
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
ashrae is another model code Group which
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
feeds into the Mechanical Code they have
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
two standards on refrigeration 15 and
 
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
34. both of those standards were updated
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
in the 2022 cycle I believe that they
 
00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
probably address the issues that now
 
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
will be reflected in the 2024 Mechanical
 
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
Code one way to get out of this would be
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
to refer to ashrae
 
00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:31.700 align:start position:0%
15-2022 and ashrae
 
00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
34-2022 in the legislation and then sets
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
and the bill Sunset the bill when the
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
state codes catch up to it so we're not
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
referring back to state code we're
 
00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
referring back to we've just given the
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
model code it's a clean version because
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
they're already published according to a
 
00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:49.460 align:start position:0%
quick Google search
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately these folks ought to look
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
at that and be sure that gets them what
 
00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
they want and they can't do that during
 
00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
the meeting here so well we don't have
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
to do anything today on this obviously
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
but um you know it's good to keep the
 
00:37:04.609 --> 00:37:04.619 align:start position:0%
we've got a little bit of time to get it
 
00:37:04.619 --> 00:37:07.010 align:start position:0%
we've got a little bit of time to get it
through

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
so perhaps they could because we won't
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
be we won't be holding an exact session
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
for a couple weeks anyway so we've got
 
00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
we've got a little bit of time
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I certainly appreciate
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
suggestion and understand the um you
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
know the ashtray standards they have
 
00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:23.339 align:start position:0%
been updated to reflect the safety
 
00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
standards needed for these new
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
refrigerant classes refrigerants
 
00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
um we in other states we've had the op
 
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
we've been proposed the opposite they
 
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
don't want to tie it to specific ashrae
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
standards especially if they're tied to
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
a particular year or version of the
 
00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
ashrae standard because then that
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
becomes obsolete next time it's updated
 
00:37:43.609 --> 00:37:43.619 align:start position:0%
you're already on a different version of
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
that bash rate standard I think well and
 
00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
I think the point there though is it's
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
the temporary stop measure until the New
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire code can get caught up back to
 
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
my initial point the concern is just
 
00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
passing something with nothing in
 
00:37:59.930 --> 00:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
reference nothing that we can go to
 
00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
um and so then we're talking about
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
trying to slow down this particular Bill
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
until the building code can move forward
 
00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
at the same time I think what he's
 
00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:08.339 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that would be your stop
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
Gap we can attach that to the present
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
legislation get that through get that
 
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
done so you guys can start working and
 
00:38:17.089 --> 00:38:17.099 align:start position:0%
then next year come back with the
 
00:38:20.329 --> 00:38:20.339 align:start position:0%
building code to replace the asteroid
 
00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
standards and then we just get rid of
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
the ashrae standards okay so Mr chair
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
just make sure I'm understanding so it
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
would be that this legislation will be
 
00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
amended to Inc include references to the
 
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
ashrae standard and it also include a
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
sunset provision tied to the 2024 that's
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's the proposal that's building
 
00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
codes being adopted yes I uh will have
 
00:38:41.089 --> 00:38:41.099 align:start position:0%
you know I will have to um obviously
 
00:38:42.589 --> 00:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
have people that I report to too but
 
00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
that sounds logical to me
 
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
um I would just have to I can't make a
 
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
you know commitment right now at this
 
00:38:50.089 --> 00:38:50.099 align:start position:0%
moment but I can get on the phone here
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
after the meeting and we'll be meeting
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
again before it goes back to the full
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
committee yeah on this so we have no
 
00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
interest in amending State Building
 
00:38:59.210 --> 00:38:59.220 align:start position:0%
Codes you know we don't want to be in in
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
the business of doing that
 
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
um this is just a unique situation that
 
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get out front of and
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
help help New Hampshire prepare for it
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
as well so right
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.010 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.390 align:start position:0%
 
just

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
so for clarification there's
 
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
both sides could come to an agreement
 
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
that we may have to choose between using
 
00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
the 2022 standards
 
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
or using
 
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was brought here
 
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
before us
 
00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:39.589 align:start position:0%
before us
um

00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
I think would address either way the
 
00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:44.579 align:start position:0%
issue provided that
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
the 22 2022 standards of ashrae have
 
00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
what you're looking for for refrigerants
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
is that what um I think so yeah
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
yes sir I think that's actually um so
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
the point on the ashrae standards is
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
more towards the safety aspect so that
 
00:40:01.849 --> 00:40:01.859 align:start position:0%
way there's you know if we if you were
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
to enact this in statute and
 
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
specifically reference the ashrae codes
 
00:40:07.849 --> 00:40:07.859 align:start position:0%
there would at least be some interim
 
00:40:07.859 --> 00:40:09.710 align:start position:0%
there would at least be some interim
safety

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
um guidance until that was formalized in
 
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
the 2024 code process right so the
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
ashrae is more of standard referencing
 
00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
Ash recent interview more for the safety
 
00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.550 align:start position:0%
Ash recent interview more for the safety
aspect

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
aspect
 
00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
um and then the other language saying
 
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
basically that
 
00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:26.099 align:start position:0%
um you can't prohibit an EPA approved
 
00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
refrigerant in the state of New
 
00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is is where that is at blanket
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
allowance that where that certainty that
 
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
we're looking for because we we can't
 
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
one one
 
00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
thing we talked about out in the hallway
 
00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
when I we just met out there was you
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
know local governments being more
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
restrictive than than the state you know
 
00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:46.140 align:start position:0%
and that that just puts together a
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework in which we it's
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
hard to do business when there's some
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
refrigerants allowed in this
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
municipality or County summon this so we
 
00:40:55.609 --> 00:40:55.619 align:start position:0%
want that blanket certainty that they're
 
00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
approved in the state and if that means
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
tying it to a Sunset and an ashrae
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
safety standard as interim safety
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
guidance and I I would think that that
 
00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
would work yeah I think I think the
 
00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
overall goal is just to make sure that
 
00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
you guys can continue to work right you
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
can continue to produce we can continue
 
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
to sell we can continue to do all that
 
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
stuff so as long as the solution
 
00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
provides for that and you have
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
assurances that it's uh that's in place
 
00:41:20.089 --> 00:41:20.099 align:start position:0%
I would assume that would meet your
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
concerns and then we just need to make
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
sure that we have a vehicle to get
 
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
um the code changes into the building
 
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.270 align:start position:0%
um the code changes into the building
code

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
code
 
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.410 align:start position:0%
code
um

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
in the long term because that's where
 
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
ultimately won't we want the solution we
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
want the solution in code we don't want
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
it in statute so some vehicle out of the
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
ones that have been kind of battered
 
00:41:40.849 --> 00:41:40.859 align:start position:0%
around today will have to come to an
 
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
agreement on which one we think is the
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
best vehicle for moving forward and
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can get the job done and
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
meet everybody's concerns at the same
 
00:41:53.089 --> 00:41:53.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
yes anything anything else from you or
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
um Papi take any questions but um we're
 
00:41:59.690 --> 00:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
talking to anybody after the meeting
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
adjourns okay yeah I think
 
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
seems like everybody's good thank you
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate it okay thank you sir
 
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
any comments from the committee just as
 
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
a mode of discussion for what we've
 
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
concerns with any of the proposed ideas
 
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:17.220 align:start position:0%
or let's get some of this stuff down in
 
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
writing so that we've got something to
 
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
look at yeah
 
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
the building code review board is
 
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
meeting tomorrow so we'll have some
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
feedback what was there somebody else
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
who wanted to speak
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Bob Clegg I
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
wrote the building code review board
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
statute when I was here I served as its
 
00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:47.810 align:start position:0%
statute when I was here I served as its
chair

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:50.119 align:start position:0%
and I would ask you not to tie that
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
temporarily to an ashrae or anything
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
else because there's no guarantee that
 
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
that ashrae standard is not going to
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
change and there's no guarantee that
 
00:42:59.450 --> 00:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
we're going to adopt the building codes
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
of 2024 in fact we're having a problem
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
right now adopting or we're going to
 
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
have a problem adopting what they're
 
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.490 align:start position:0%
have a problem adopting what they're
proposing

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
proposing
 
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
but the problem we do have that we need
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
to fix is the idea that something new is
 
00:43:13.069 --> 00:43:13.079 align:start position:0%
coming along
 
00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:15.740 align:start position:0%
and we can't use it on the outside
 
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
unless the legislature says we can we
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
can't wait two years
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm a developer I build a
 
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
lot of big buildings I build a lot of
 
00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing and every time
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
somebody comes up with something new we
 
00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
want to use it
 
00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:33.500 align:start position:0%
but if I use it I know I take the the
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility if something goes wrong
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
especially since it hasn't been approved
 
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
by the building called review board
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
but if we keep styming everything what's
 
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
going to happen in the city in the state
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
is that we're going to have to buy the
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
old equipment we're going to have to pay
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
more for that refrigerant that's not
 
00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:55.370 align:start position:0%
more for that refrigerant that's not
available

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking if you're going to do
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
anything pass it so we can use it
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
we know that when we buy that equipment
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
with that refrigerant and it's our
 
00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:05.819 align:start position:0%
problem no matter what happens it's our
 
00:44:05.819 --> 00:44:06.710 align:start position:0%
problem no matter what happens it's our
problem

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
but but if you want to do something
 
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
Sunset it in two years that allows you
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
to to re-up it
 
00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
but not attached to any code that may
 
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
not be
 
00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
reasonable enough for everybody in the
 
00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:19.370 align:start position:0%
reasonable enough for everybody in the
industry

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
to adopt
 
00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:23.099 align:start position:0%
so it's important what you're doing here
 
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
I understand but it's also important
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
that it's not tied to anything else it's
 
00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
a decision by the legislature building
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
code review board
 
00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
used to have all the responsibility to
 
00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
review them anyways
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
and I think that's more reasonable I'm a
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
developer like I said if I buy one of
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
those machines with that refrigerant in
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
it and something goes wrong it's my
 
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:45.710 align:start position:0%
it and something goes wrong it's my
problems

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
and and I think that's the way we should
 
00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
we should approach it I'll tell you that
 
00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
I was the first one to use 32 foot ply
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
lamps was what we called them in a day
 
00:44:56.569 --> 00:44:56.579 align:start position:0%
for a roof and the code said I couldn't
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
because there was no code that said I
 
00:44:58.079 --> 00:44:58.910 align:start position:0%
because there was no code that said I
could

00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
so it took me months
 
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
to find somebody who said we'll let you
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
use it but sign here if the roof
 
00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.650 align:start position:0%
use it but sign here if the roof
collapses

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
collapses
 
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
you're responsible I signed it and that
 
00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
house is 28 years old today and there's
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
no problem
 
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
so if you let us in the industry figure
 
00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:17.220 align:start position:0%
out what it is we need and what it is
 
00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
we'll use
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
it'll make it a lot easier for those who
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
aren't in the industry to understand
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions
 
00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to wind up like in
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
Kentucky where they've hamstrung
 
00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:32.420 align:start position:0%
themselves and they can't do anything
 
00:45:35.329 --> 00:45:35.339 align:start position:0%
so let's get some of this stuff in
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
writing so we can look at it
 
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
yeah uh yeah and it doesn't seem like
 
00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
anybody wants that to happen obviously I
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
think everybody seems like they want to
 
00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:46.380 align:start position:0%
make sure that we can innovate and and
 
00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
work with the latest stuff what was your
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
concern though about adopting the ashrae
 
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
the codes or what you do and that
 
00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
standard changes
 
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
so does what you did so in all the years
 
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
I spent in the legislature we tried not
 
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
to use something by reference if there's
 
00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
something in the ashrae code you want to
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
use put it in
 
00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
but don't say Ashley 15 because if
 
00:46:14.329 --> 00:46:14.339 align:start position:0%
tomorrow somebody makes a change to it
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
now we're Bound by that because the
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
legislature said just that number
 
00:46:21.119 --> 00:46:25.010 align:start position:0%
legislature said just that number
we

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:26.569 --> 00:46:26.579 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
couldn't you simply not that I'm in fan
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
I really don't have a position on any of
 
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
this stuff I think it's just you know
 
00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
less government better but couldn't you
 
00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
just cite that particular code though
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
they have different editions like when
 
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
we get Amendments of zero zero zero one
 
00:46:41.569 --> 00:46:41.579 align:start position:0%
eight can you just say this ashrae at
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
this point because you can't have a
 
00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
floating you you could try to say in
 
00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
effect as of this date yeah but you
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
would have to call and make sure the day
 
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
you adopt it it didn't change in the
 
00:46:52.849 --> 00:46:52.859 align:start position:0%
meantime I mean we
 
00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
all right it is an ongoing yeah I
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying yeah all
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
any any other questions
 
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for testifying
 
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
appreciate that for your input Mr
 
00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
Sherman did you have something you want
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
to attend no we're good
 
00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
all right um I'm gonna close up the work
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
session for this time then
 
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
um we can
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
continue the conversation we'll get some
 
00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
stuff done on writing so that we can
 
00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
consider some different options and then
 
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
um we'll call another meeting and
 
00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully finish this up and be able to
 
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
push something too exact does that make
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
sense yeah
 
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
I sort of like the the discussion that
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
you don't even need this
 
00:47:39.599 --> 00:47:40.550 align:start position:0%
you don't even need this
um

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
so um so well we won't we won't need it
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
once it's in code
 
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
so right yeah
 
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
and that they're working on they're
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
working the building then biomass
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
they're working on the codes so they
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
will meet it
 
00:47:59.329 --> 00:47:59.339 align:start position:0%
whether we pass this or not that's
 
00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
that's their job
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
the question is when it becomes
 
00:48:03.119 --> 00:48:04.370 align:start position:0%
the question is when it becomes
effective

00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:05.930 align:start position:0%
effective
so

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
um how long will it take to get the code
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
produced passed can we be assured that
 
00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
they will pass and those are the
 
00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
questions that are kind of up in the air
 
00:48:16.609 --> 00:48:16.619 align:start position:0%
so if if for some reason the code
 
00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
and we don't pass something like this
 
00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
then they just can't we can't buy those
 
00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:23.870 align:start position:0%
then they just can't we can't buy those
refrigerants

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
refrigerants
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
who else
 
00:48:29.809 --> 00:48:29.819 align:start position:0%
all right I'm closing up the work
