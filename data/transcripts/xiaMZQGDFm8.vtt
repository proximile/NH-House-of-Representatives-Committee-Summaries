00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
can we all just have henry start off
 
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
with an explanation or the other of you
 
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.630 align:start position:0%
with an explanation or the other of you
have

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
okay henry why don't you come up and
 
00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
have at it
 
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 align:start position:0%

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
i think i would like to start
 
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
sort of at the very top
 
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.270 align:start position:0%
sort of at the very top
that

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 align:start position:0%
included in the budget
 
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
in every year is a lump sum amount
 
00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 align:start position:0%
to cover
 
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
nursing home nursing facility costs
 
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.270 align:start position:0%
nursing home nursing facility costs
and

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.789 align:start position:0%
and
historically

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
historically
 
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.429 align:start position:0%
there's also
a

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
you may have heard another context a
 
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
factor that the department of the the
 
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
total budget amount
 
00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
does not necessarily equate to
 
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
a five percent rate increase and that's
 
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
what i want to
 
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
explain um
 
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
in my
 
00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
discussion here with you
 
00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.789 align:start position:0%
discussion here with you
um

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 align:start position:0%
at it at a global level on the
 
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
the amount
 
00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 align:start position:0%
that is available to
 
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
to to fund services right uh date
 
00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
patient days in the nursing facility
 
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
is a function of the total budget that
 
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
we're allowed to work with in this case
 
00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
whatever was originally plus the five
 
00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.430 align:start position:0%
whatever was originally plus the five
percent

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
and the number of days that we expect to
 
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
pay for
 
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
you may recall i believe it was an hp
 
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
one that originally 3 900 was the number
 
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
of days
 
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
bed bed days
 
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
days that we'd be
 
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
bed days that we'd be
 
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
paying for
 
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
over the course every day for the course
 
00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
of a year is effectively what that
 
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
as you're also aware because many of you
 
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
work on county level things that county
 
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and other nursing homes
 
00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 align:start position:0%
have had a decrease in the number of
 
00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:52.470 align:start position:0%
have had a decrease in the number of
days

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
um due to
 
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
covert and related things
 
00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
staffing shortages and what have you
 
00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
well i think the
 
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
this was the first time i'm aware of
 
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
that in the budget
 
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
documents that a prescribed number of
 
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
days was
 
00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
was included in there um and
 
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
and so in setting the rates
 
00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 align:start position:0%
um which on a facility level vary based
 
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
on the acuity meaning the intensity of
 
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.270 align:start position:0%
on the acuity meaning the intensity of
service

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
um that they have and the the um
 
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
their costs so
 
00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 align:start position:0%
if you kind of think about it in a
 
00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
personal level you know we're dealing
 
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
with inflation now right just on a
 
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
personal level inflation's eight and a
 
00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 align:start position:0%
half percent if you get a an increase a
 
00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
in medicare um of six percent you know
 
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
that you're actually going to lose
 
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
spending power in much the same way the
 
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
the nursing facilities if their expenses
 
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
go up
 
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
and um they could potentially even
 
00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
though they're getting more money
 
00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
result in a lower rate because their
 
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
expenses are increasing higher than the
 
00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 align:start position:0%
amount of money that we're putting in
 
00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:58.390 align:start position:0%
amount of money that we're putting in
but

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
so what
 
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
ended up happening um very early on
 
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 align:start position:0%
well sort of when you said the rate
 
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 align:start position:0%
would go down the relative rate would
 
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
but the
 
00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 align:start position:0%
the absolute rate
 
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
was only impacted by the bed days not by
 
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
the inflation rate correct correct i was
 
00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
just using inflation as a
 
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
as as sort of a comparison something
 
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
that people could maybe connect in their
 
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
personal life that okay you know if
 
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
inflation goes up more than your your
 
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
salary then you end up losing spending
 
00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:31.350 align:start position:0%
salary then you end up losing spending
power

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
power
 
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
similarly um and you said something else
 
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
for the first time
 
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
we put in a bad day
 
00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 align:start position:0%
in the budget so that was probably a
 
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
mistake on our part
 
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
i think i'll look to
 
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
kevin if he has a different perspective
 
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
on that but i think that we also got an
 
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
opinion that we could deviate from that
 
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
based on what we were observing and so
 
00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
we reset the rates based on a more
 
00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
current experience in
 
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
i believe october which led
 
00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
the rate increase when we just used the
 
00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
3900 was around 1.6 percent
 
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
and then when we were able to reset it
 
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
based on um
 
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.870 align:start position:0%
based on um
more

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
current but still i think lagging behind
 
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
what was happening number we were able
 
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
to get the rate up to 3.6
 
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
we did another rate setting in january
 
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
which we would ordinarily do
 
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
and the rate got up to uh five percent
 
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
um actually a little bit up above five
 
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.469 align:start position:0%
um actually a little bit up above five
percent

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
i think um senator rosenwald and um
 
00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 align:start position:0%
what um
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
senator gotta senator geider both were
 
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
on top of us real quickly in terms of
 
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
you know they were hearing from
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
constituents this wasn't what was
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
intended in the budget and so um
 
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
you know i think they try to fashion
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
something where
 
00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:03.749 align:start position:0%
something where
um

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know there would be potentially if
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
needed to so that the full
 
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
year of 22 in the full year of 23 would
 
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
support you know the 5
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
increase which i think was the intent of
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
the legislators in terms of putting five
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
percent more in i think there's a what
 
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't i think transparent is that
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
there's a whole state plan
 
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
methodology that depends on
 
00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
the individual facilities cost and their
 
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
their acuity as well
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
but so
 
00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
the way
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities are ultimately
 
00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
reimbursed is that
 
00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:37.510 align:start position:0%
reimbursed is that
the

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 align:start position:0%
legislation in this year and other years
 
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
says anything that's left in the account
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year gets paid back
 
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
out pro rata based on patient days
 
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
so it looks like um you know we're at
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
five percent now but i think the in the
 
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
senate the perspective was we want the
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
five percent to at least
 
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
be in effect for the entire year we've
 
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
also identified that
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
you know there's some risk in 23 if um
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
the coveted situation and the labor
 
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
situation turns around that we could
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
also see
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
you know patient activity go up again
 
00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
number of patient days
 
00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
that we could find ourselves short and
 
00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:18.629 align:start position:0%
that we could find ourselves short and
23.

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
23.
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
so i think the idea in the legislation
 
00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:21.189 align:start position:0%
so i think the idea in the legislation
was

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
to have the 5 million as a contingency
 
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
if need be to make sure that the 5
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
percent was delivered
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
and if it wasn't if it wasn't needed
 
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
then it would lapse back into um the
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
general fund and if you can correct me
 
00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
um i think the i guess the only thing i
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
would comment on is whether
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
you think that
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
say you get the five million dollar
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
appropriation authorized by this bill
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
whether you think that any unspent
 
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
amount would go back into the general
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
fund or whether you think the footnote
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
on 2152 would apply that says any
 
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
unspent amount or goes back to the
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
nursing homes at the end of the year i'm
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not really clear on that myself
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
i guess the way i've interpreted it is
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
that we would only tap into that five
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
million to the extent that it was needed
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
to deliver the five percent and
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise it would lapse
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
unlike the 504 account with laps back to
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
the general fund i think that was
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
the senator's intent in introducing that
 
00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
and one other question
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
and that's to imply to apply not just
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
through this fiscal year but also
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:31.749 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
so question you you said in january you
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
we calculated and you hit five percent
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
so had you used those same
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
parameters back in
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
july last year you would hit the five
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
percent right then correct right if you
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
remember though like we've gone through
 
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
waves if this seems to be over and then
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
it's then it's not or we're going to
 
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.110 align:start position:0%
it's then it's not or we're going to
recover

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
recover
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
healthcare activity and then it hasn't
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
and i think what we're seeing now is it
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
seems to be you know the the workforce
 
00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
shortage is maybe a larger factor than
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
even any
 
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
um particular public health issue if you
 
00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:07.430 align:start position:0%
um particular public health issue if you
will

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.550 align:start position:0%
will
so

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
how do you read this bill that there
 
00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
immediate of this passes that there
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
should be immediate payment to make up
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
for the last whereas whatever it's been
 
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
since july and then applying the five
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
percent going forward or that we apply
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
the five percent going forward and see
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
if we run out of money by the end of
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
so i i i see it as
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
um we have plot i think you look at you
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
have to look at this on an on a
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
annual basis because of the 504 account
 
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
provision where any leftover amount
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
gets passed back
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
so the way i look at it is do we achieve
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
five percent for the full
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
22 if we have
 
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.509 align:start position:0%
22 if we have
um

00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:50.710 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
then then we wouldn't use any of it and
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
if it went into 23 and we were short of
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
being able to sustain that rate then we
 
00:09:57.519 --> 00:09:59.829 align:start position:0%
being able to sustain that rate then we
would

00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
okay but we're not going to get we
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't hit the 405 for the full year
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
if we're only at five percent now we
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
don't go up or by misunderstanding yeah
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
i i think that the from correct in terms
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
of how the 504 account flows is that at
 
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
the end of each year
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
we um
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
this is christy roy who actually does
 
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
the work behind the scenes here
 
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.069 align:start position:0%
the work behind the scenes here
um

00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that utilization is so
 
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.430 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that utilization is so
low

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
low
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that the utilization has
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
decreased so much
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
the remainder in that 504 account
 
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.310 align:start position:0%
the remainder in that 504 account
we're

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
assuming for the remainder of this year
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
could be enough
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
to sustain the five percent for the full
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
year so if we calculated the average
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
rate for all the nursing facilities at
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
the utilization that they're actually at
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
rather than what the forecasted
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
utilization was back when we calculated
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
the rates at the beginning of the fiscal
 
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.350 align:start position:0%
the rates at the beginning of the fiscal
year

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
it would be five percent does that is
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
that clear
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
it is if
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
you're expecting that there'll be a
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
greater payout in the final few months
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
here so that the average works out is
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
that kind of what you're trying to say
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
yes so at the remainder
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
of at the close of the fiscal year
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
whatever remains in that 504 account
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
will be paid out we could expect that
 
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.990 align:start position:0%
will be paid out we could expect that
figure

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
figure
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
for you know for the last four months we
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
would expect that figure
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
enough to cover five percent as an
 
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.310 align:start position:0%
enough to cover five percent as an
average

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
average
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
for all of the nursing facilities okay
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
not facility specific five percent but
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
on average and and that doesn't require
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
any funds from this bill were to become
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
law for this year for this year and then
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
for the year or just for the last few
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
months five percent on average for the
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
full year we're currently at five
 
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
percent now
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
um or over just over five percent an
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
increase of where we were and as of june
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
now but we're talking about for the full
 
00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.509 align:start position:0%
now but we're talking about for the full
year

00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
but that's only for this year not for
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
okay just because you're not aware of
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
what potential average bed counts that
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
sort of thing will be correct
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
and right and cost reports um and acuity
 
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
so there's there's multiple figures in
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
there okay
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
but i'm guessing that you have some
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
feeling for how that varies over time
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
we we
 
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
we generally do but um there's
 
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
definitely been challenges with coped
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
i mean where we were always around the
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
4100 when that i think when that
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
original 3 900 was put in it was a
 
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
relief because you know
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
the facility saw it as a relief however
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
when we were trending at 3600 it became
 
00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
a hindrance so
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
we had always had the flexibility to use
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
actual figures as they were trending
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
and that challenged
 
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
us so it sounds like you think perhaps
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
bed council go up in the next year
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
i think the industry folks here probably
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
have a better feel for us but
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
um you know that that is i think a
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
possibility none of us have been
 
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
predicting utilization very well in this
 
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.870 align:start position:0%
predicting utilization very well in this
environment

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.829 align:start position:0%
environment
but

00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
the way i kind of look at it is
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
we're trying to meet the legislative
 
00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:14.550 align:start position:0%
we're trying to meet the legislative
intent

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
intent
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
of what was passed which is to provide
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
an average increase of 5 percent i think
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to do it based on what
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
we're seeing so far this year um 23 is a
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
question mark i think when the
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
legislation was introduced by the
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
senator to begin with it was less
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
certain that we'd hit five percent
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
because we were only at 1.66 and then
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
three points something and until getting
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
another look at it
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
i think you know the
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
maybe the larger picture that i wasn't
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
here for the earlier meeting and i
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
apologize i wasn't able to make it but
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
you know i think the nursing
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
facility sector with wage costs and
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
everything's under a lot of pressure
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
i think what we're addressing here is
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
whether the five percent can be achieved
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
or not i think there may be other
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
arguments that that it needs to be more
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
for other reasons um but we just want to
 
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.470 align:start position:0%
for other reasons um but we just want to
be

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
testified to the bill specifically so to
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
stay in the four corners
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
the other questions
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
robson walnut so i i just want to be
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
clear i just want to for myself be clear
 
00:14:11.199 --> 00:14:12.150 align:start position:0%
clear i just want to for myself be clear
so

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
for this year
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
you uh would not need to use
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
you and are not anticipating that you
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
have to use any of the five million
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's in this
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
correct bill okay so you have enough
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
to do the five percent
 
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.350 align:start position:0%
to do the five percent
and

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
not use
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
this but it's in 20 the next fiscal year
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
that you anticipate that you'll need the
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
five million in order to continue
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
the five percent right and the reason is
 
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
because the
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
going from 4 100 to 3 900 to now about 3
 
00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
600 i think we're at somewhere in that
 
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
neighborhood um that gives us confidence
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
if that were to spring back um then
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's where we might we wouldn't
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily have enough money to to
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
cover that five percent and that's most
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
likely now to play out in 23 based on
 
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me i think maybe i misspoke but
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
no yeah it originally
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
originally the bed days
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
we had started and we had been using
 
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.590 align:start position:0%
we had started and we had been using
4100

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
4100
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
and then there was a bed day factor put
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
in to one of the house bills that was 3
 
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.590 align:start position:0%
in to one of the house bills that was 3
900

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
900
 
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
um and that was what caused the
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
challenge and where we were actually at
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
at that time was around 3 600 i believe
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
and then when we readjusted in october
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
we were down to i think we ended up
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
utilizing a 35 something for the figure
 
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.710 align:start position:0%
utilizing a 35 something for the figure
so

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
and where are you now
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
or january when you did your last 35
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
yeah that's i think we used around 3 500
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
and there are certain days that we do
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
remove from that factor like atypical
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and this is probably
 
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
actually for the committee
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
on line 11
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
it there's a sentence that says the
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
department may accept and expend
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
matching federal funds without prior
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
approval of the fiscal committee is that
 
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
standard practice or is that
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
is that an exception to our general
 
00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.430 align:start position:0%
is that an exception to our general
policy

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's been standard
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
standard practice in many cases where
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
you have a standalone bill that
 
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
appropriates general funds that may also
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
come with federal funds because in the
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
budget you're actually appropriating the
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
federal funds themselves so the
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
department has no reason to go to fiscal
 
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.749 align:start position:0%
department has no reason to go to fiscal
um

00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
in this case you're not making that
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation clear so you're just
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
allowing the department the authority to
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
spend those funds without having to go
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
all right and
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
thanks for that and then the second
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
should should we specific
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
specify whether this these funds lapse
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
you could i think
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
i think the explanation that henry gave
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me um i think if you
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to be crystal clear you could add
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
a line in here saying that any unspent
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
funds appropriated
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
as a result of this 5 million will lapse
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
at the end of the biennium
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much both of you i
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate it we'll hang around if you
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
oh we'll go ahead so so mr lippman uh
 
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
i i i didn't have any more questions
 
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
about the bill but i but i uh i wonder
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
did you get word um
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%

00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not even close
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
miss belanger thank you
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
did you get word that um
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
i i would really appreciate a
 
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.110 align:start position:0%
i i would really appreciate a
written

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
document of exactly what went wrong and
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
and what
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh i and i and if it were oriented
 
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
towards um teaching future division
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
three people you know how we made this
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
mistake so that we don't do it again
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
that would be great i'd be happy to put
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
something together i had to sort of put
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
that together to explain it to the
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
senators when they were looking at the
 
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
bills i have something already sort of
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
started on that but the simplest thing
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
to remember about
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities if you're up against
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
this is that five percent added to the
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
budget doesn't necessarily translate to
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
a five percent rate increase because of
 
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:02.950 align:start position:0%
a five percent rate increase because of
how

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
costs at facilities or their acuities
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
change but and i think it was you know
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
in talking to karen rounds um
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
i think that uh
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
it's that was at the sort of the tail
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
end of of uh
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference where
 
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.710 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference where
um

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
you know i think it was decided based on
 
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
input you were getting to to make a
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
change and i think it just happened
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
without the chance to sort of take it
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
back to the department and run some
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
calculations i think
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
similar to the benefit of a fiscal note
 
00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.990 align:start position:0%
similar to the benefit of a fiscal note
it's

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
you know you can test your assumption as
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
to what you're going on so i guess those
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
are the two things but i'm happy to
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
write it up and and submit it to you if
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
that's all the committee and the
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
objective there would also just be tell
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
us how to how to do it that's right well
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
i mean you we now we know how to do it
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
wrong you know if you could just tell us
 
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
how to do it right that would be
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
great also is it possible to see a
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that shows the formula that
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
you use based on that day's acuity and
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
all those kinds of things just get a
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
feel for
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
how that actually all
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
we have definitely documents but
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet would be a little bit
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
challenging but i have documents that we
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
can show that walks through the whole
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
process it's all written in our state
 
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.190 align:start position:0%
process it's all written in our state
plan

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
um and it's
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit complicated because it
 
00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
depends on like costs and cost reports
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
but yeah we definitely have documents
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
that can walk you through the whole
 
00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:26.230 align:start position:0%
that can walk you through the whole
thing

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
that we already have prepared that we
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
you know can't do the general public or
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
new nursing facility administrators do
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
they include something like an equation
 
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.149 align:start position:0%
they include something like an equation
for

00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
not the date not the total
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
days and calculating
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
the rates but yes and we have um
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
committee members and like a committee
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
that we go through first so absolutely
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
what might be helpful if we could do
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
something um one-on-one like we did with
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
the actuarial studies
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
we could show you that all that details
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
because some of it's proprietary for
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
and and then also um
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
okay so it's practically april 15th
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
and i i was unaware of this problem that
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
has been happening since july
 
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.630 align:start position:0%
has been happening since july
uh

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
and i would just ask you in the future
 
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
if we've broken something and you guys
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
need help
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
that uh i'd hate to i hate being the
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
last person to hear about it i have
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
three people on my committee on this
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
bill as co-sponsors
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
and i didn't even know we had a problem
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
so we have a breakdown in communication
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
message heard and we'll do a better job
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
thank you director
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else would like to
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh jim monahan with the dupont group for
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire association of
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
counties i think henry explained much
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
better than i did or could have but i
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
did want to i did say i would come back
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
and report i know representative
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
leishman isn't here so but i think
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
the question about you know is it
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
retroactive and how would that pick
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
salaries was answered by henry when he
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
effectively said
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
as we stand today the five percent rate
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
increase has occurred
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
the concern is only will you have
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
funds in the budget for next year to
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
continue it so i think that answers the
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
question about whether
 
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know it is um
 
00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.630 align:start position:0%
you know it is um
uh

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
recto active in
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
nature uh when it came to any sort of
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
salary increases things like that and
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
then finally just on this question of
 
00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:38.559 align:start position:0%
uh we the counties were strong advocates
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
of putting the bed count in the budget
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
as you may recall part of that was
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
because the governor's budget had an 18
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
increase in the county cap
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
and one of the ways to reduce that was
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
to have the committee determine how many
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
bed days is that based on so going from
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
4 100 to 3 900 in the budget allowed us
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
to begin to push the county cap down and
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
that was the reason we did it so or
 
00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.430 align:start position:0%
that was the reason we did it so or
advocated

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
advocated
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
so for future reference when you're
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with us remind us to put in an
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
exception so that we get the number in
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
there correctly but then we tell them
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
not to use it in an appropriate way
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
well that's what you've got kevin ripple
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
for yeah okay
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
it else have any questions for mr
 
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.149 align:start position:0%
it else have any questions for mr
monahan

00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
others in the
 
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.390 align:start position:0%
others in the
audience

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
audience
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
yeah come on up

remind me
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh for the record
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
brendan williams president of the new
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire healthcare association and uh
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
just reiterating our support for this
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
legislation i think for the reasons that
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
uh director lipman outlined ensuring
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
that the money exists
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
for the next fiscal year
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
to fund this increase
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
you know particularly given that the
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
increase itself
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
is still going to fall very short of
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
meeting the costs associated with this
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic and so
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh we still regard this as a critical
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and encourage your
 
00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:12.950 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and encourage your
support

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
mr lippman can i ask you another
 
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.190 align:start position:0%
mr lippman can i ask you another
question

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
this is a broader much broader question
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
um but it ties in with the point that we
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
just made about and you made as well
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
that the nursing home costs have gone up
 
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:29.990 align:start position:0%
that the nursing home costs have gone up
and

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
they're being squeezed sitting on the
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee i noticed a lot of
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
funding coming through for a variety of
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
things specifically geared towards
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
nursing homes strike teams enhanced
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
payments and that sort of thing can you
 
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.710 align:start position:0%
payments and that sort of thing can you
quantify

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
quantify
 
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.669 align:start position:0%
quantify
how

00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:24:45.679 --> 00:24:47.350 align:start position:0%
how
much

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
funding of that type has come through to
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
to assist nursing homes on top of what
 
00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.310 align:start position:0%
to assist nursing homes on top of what
was

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
budgeted last last year
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
i i'm sure the department could i think
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
karen rounds prepared something for um
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
government council similar to that
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
question i mean i think there's been
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
stuff that's come through the state um
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
through state control of federal funds
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
that have been and then there's funds
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
that came directly from
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
cms to facilities
 
00:25:15.919 --> 00:25:17.510 align:start position:0%
cms to facilities
um

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
here's sort of the the catch 22 of some
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
of this for example um
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with the probably the
 
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.830 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with the probably the
mqip

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
mqip
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
tax that is paid and
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that and you're
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
also familiar with pro share right
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
how some of these things can work
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
against each other but like so the state
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
received an extra 6.2 percent during
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
prior period
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
and we passed that on directly to
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities as as payment
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
the way the pro share methodology works
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
they look at payment against costs so if
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
payments go up as a result of that 6.2
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
percent pro share gets pushed down a bit
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
um and so there's
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of hydraulics here in behind
 
00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.430 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of hydraulics here in behind
how

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
the ultimate rates get set but
 
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.350 align:start position:0%
the ultimate rates get set but
um

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
so you know they may
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
we increase the facility rate depending
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
on how costs go it could have
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
i think we're talking about in this
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
particular rate increase costs have
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
certainly gone up at least five percent
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
but if they didn't you know if you then
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
you run the risk that you're pro share
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
but the counties could go down as well
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
to some degree so it's
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
so is it hard to quantify
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
it's not hard to quantify when you have
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
the all the numbers in and can run the
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
calculations it's pretty um that's what
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
christy does for us um and i think we've
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
shared spreadsheets with you before for
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
hillsboro county but um it's hard to
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
anticipate in advance because we
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
facilities prepare their cost report
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
after the close of a fiscal year so you
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
know if they're doing
 
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
if they're being audited it may be three
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
months past the close of a fiscal year
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
before they truly know how their costs
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
are going to go and then
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
depending on
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
the share of medicaid patients treated
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
by the facility costs may get allocated
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
one way or another so in a year where
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
medicaid is more predominant there's
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
more costs to be able to be paid for
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
under medicaid but if another year
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
private pay is is is a higher percentage
 
00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.149 align:start position:0%
private pay is is is a higher percentage
then

00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
then they could lose medicaid
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that way
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
so looking backward would be able to see
 
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
what that looked like for
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
not this fiscal year but 21.
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
i mean we do all those calculations
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
again i think uh
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's something that we could walk
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
through with you to okay to help it
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
provide some background on it and just
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
be able to understand you know what the
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
balance is there um across the board of
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
with all that's been flowing in and out
 
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
of the state one of the things i'm as
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
out of concern
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
with where the
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
nursing homes our nursing facilities are
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
trying to deal with the labor costs
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
and through our state
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh county fiscal committee you know i am
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
trying to working with christie and
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
we're trying to look at different ways
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
that we could um within
 
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
cms's allowable methodologies to find
 
00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:12.799 align:start position:0%
ways to to leverage our state spending
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
better um and we have
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
where they a year ago where they try to
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
cut back on it we found some ways to
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
offset what they were allowing for but
 
00:28:21.279 --> 00:28:22.070 align:start position:0%
offset what they were allowing for but
that's

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's a constant battle with us in
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
terms of you know
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like tax law they they find
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
different ways to to to pay less in the
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
as opposed to um you know a tax
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
situation but it's it's a there are
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
people who do this for a living every
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
so we're we're
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
we definitely want to make sure
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
our beneficiaries are cared for with
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
enough resources and so you know we're
 
00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:50.559 align:start position:0%
in the game with them
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you anything else folks
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the audience like
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
in that case i guess we're done as
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
unless somebody else says they need new
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
business their old business address
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
so do you understand mr chair
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
why the preterm scheduled
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
this meeting of division three so
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
quickly after the finance committee
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
reviewed the same bill that is she
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
expecting us to
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
vote this out so then return it to the
 
00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.990 align:start position:0%
vote this out so then return it to the
committee

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
that's not my understanding i understand
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
she's basically wanted us to get through
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
the work sessions today across the board
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
all the various divisions
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
we haven't voted out the other two which
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
are really important sp ones i mentioned
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
the medicaid dental
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
and the other we talked about when you

a support for the bill from what we've
 
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
learned so far
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
i'm fine with that if everybody else is
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
i don't want to you know care about that
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
can we support it so
 
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
i i can support it but i'm really
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
irritated this is the first i've heard
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
and just to continue on then do we all
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
support the the medicaid dental benefit
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
as amended to match
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
i do
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
yeah mr representative
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
yes and what was the other bill we
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
discussed last time
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
i know
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
that was a dental build it was the same
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
as 103.
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
so we all support that right
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
yeah 422 was it was this was the oh
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:06.470 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
i think the only bills in division three
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
are 412 and 422. there was another one
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
assigned to division three that was
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
reassigned to division one okay
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
all right so it sounds like we're all in
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
agreement at least tentatively on those
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
