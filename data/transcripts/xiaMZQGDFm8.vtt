we reset the rates based on a more

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
so question you you said in january you
 

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:36.149 align:start position:0%
so question you you said in january you
we<00:08:34.560><c> calculated</c><00:08:35.039><c> and</c><00:08:35.120><c> you</c><00:08:35.200><c> hit</c><00:08:35.360><c> five</c><00:08:35.519><c> percent</c>

00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
we calculated and you hit five percent
 

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:39.029 align:start position:0%
we calculated and you hit five percent
so<00:08:36.479><c> had</c><00:08:36.640><c> you</c><00:08:36.880><c> used</c><00:08:37.279><c> those</c><00:08:37.599><c> same</c>

00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
so had you used those same
 

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.389 align:start position:0%
so had you used those same

00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
july last year you would hit the five

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
um we have plot i think you look at you
 

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.230 align:start position:0%
um we have plot i think you look at you
have<00:09:31.760><c> to</c><00:09:31.839><c> look</c><00:09:32.000><c> at</c><00:09:32.080><c> this</c><00:09:32.320><c> on</c><00:09:32.480><c> an</c><00:09:32.959><c> on</c><00:09:33.279><c> a</c>

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
have to look at this on an on a
 

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.030 align:start position:0%
have to look at this on an on a
annual<00:09:34.560><c> basis</c><00:09:35.040><c> because</c><00:09:35.680><c> of</c><00:09:35.760><c> the</c><00:09:36.000><c> 504</c><00:09:36.640><c> account</c>

annual basis because of the 504 account
 

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.150 align:start position:0%

provision<00:09:37.519><c> where</c><00:09:38.080><c> any</c><00:09:38.320><c> leftover</c><00:09:38.880><c> amount</c>

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
provision where any leftover amount
 

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.750 align:start position:0%
provision where any leftover amount
gets<00:09:40.480><c> passed</c><00:09:40.800><c> back</c>

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
gets passed back
 

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.550 align:start position:0%
gets passed back
so<00:09:42.080><c> the</c><00:09:42.240><c> way</c><00:09:42.399><c> i</c><00:09:42.480><c> look</c><00:09:42.720><c> at</c><00:09:42.880><c> it</c><00:09:43.040><c> is</c><00:09:43.279><c> do</c><00:09:43.440><c> we</c><00:09:43.680><c> achieve</c>

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
so the way i look at it is do we achieve
 

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.470 align:start position:0%
so the way i look at it is do we achieve
five<00:09:44.800><c> percent</c><00:09:45.200><c> for</c><00:09:45.360><c> the</c><00:09:45.600><c> full</c>

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.509 align:start position:0%

um

00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:50.710 align:start position:0%

the

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
then then we wouldn't use any of it and
 

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.670 align:start position:0%
then then we wouldn't use any of it and

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
because we were only at 1.66 and then
 

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.590 align:start position:0%
because we were only at 1.66 and then

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
i think what we're addressing here is
 

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.189 align:start position:0%
i think what we're addressing here is
whether<00:13:51.920><c> the</c><00:13:52.000><c> five</c><00:13:52.240><c> percent</c><00:13:52.560><c> can</c><00:13:52.720><c> be</c><00:13:52.800><c> achieved</c>

00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
whether the five percent can be achieved
 

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:54.710 align:start position:0%
whether the five percent can be achieved
or<00:13:53.279><c> not</c><00:13:53.519><c> i</c><00:13:53.600><c> think</c><00:13:54.000><c> there</c><00:13:54.160><c> may</c><00:13:54.320><c> be</c><00:13:54.480><c> other</c>

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.470 align:start position:0%
or not i think there may be other

at that time was around 3 600 i believe
and<00:15:36.160><c> then</c><00:15:36.320><c> when</c><00:15:36.480><c> we</c><00:15:36.639><c> readjusted</c><00:15:37.360><c> in</c><00:15:37.519><c> october</c>

and then when we readjusted in october
 

00:15:38.079 --> 00:15:40.150 align:start position:0%
and then when we readjusted in october
we<00:15:38.320><c> were</c><00:15:38.480><c> down</c><00:15:38.800><c> to</c><00:15:39.199><c> i</c><00:15:39.279><c> think</c><00:15:39.519><c> we</c><00:15:39.680><c> ended</c><00:15:40.000><c> up</c>

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
we were down to i think we ended up
 

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.590 align:start position:0%
we were down to i think we ended up
utilizing<00:15:40.720><c> a</c><00:15:40.800><c> 35</c><00:15:42.079><c> something</c><00:15:42.560><c> for</c><00:15:42.720><c> the</c><00:15:42.880><c> figure</c>

so

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%

yeah<00:15:50.240><c> that's</c><00:15:50.720><c> i</c><00:15:50.959><c> think</c><00:15:51.120><c> we</c><00:15:51.279><c> used</c><00:15:51.519><c> around</c><00:15:51.759><c> 3</c><00:15:52.160><c> 500</c>

00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
yeah that's i think we used around 3 500
 

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:55.030 align:start position:0%
yeah that's i think we used around 3 500
and<00:15:53.680><c> there</c><00:15:53.839><c> are</c><00:15:53.920><c> certain</c><00:15:54.399><c> days</c><00:15:54.720><c> that</c><00:15:54.800><c> we</c><00:15:54.880><c> do</c>

and there are certain days that we do
 

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.189 align:start position:0%

i mean you we now we know how to do it
 

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.789 align:start position:0%
i mean you we now we know how to do it
wrong<00:19:47.440><c> you</c><00:19:47.600><c> know</c><00:19:47.760><c> if</c><00:19:47.919><c> you</c><00:19:48.000><c> could</c><00:19:48.160><c> just</c><00:19:48.400><c> tell</c><00:19:48.640><c> us</c>

wrong you know if you could just tell us
 

00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:50.830 align:start position:0%
wrong you know if you could just tell us
how<00:19:48.960><c> to</c><00:19:49.120><c> do</c><00:19:49.280><c> it</c><00:19:49.520><c> right</c><00:19:49.840><c> that</c><00:19:50.000><c> would</c><00:19:50.160><c> be</c>

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
how to do it right that would be
 

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.029 align:start position:0%
how to do it right that would be
great<00:19:51.840><c> also</c><00:19:52.160><c> is</c><00:19:52.240><c> it</c><00:19:52.320><c> possible</c><00:19:52.640><c> to</c><00:19:52.720><c> see</c><00:19:52.880><c> a</c>

00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
great also is it possible to see a
 

00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:55.190 align:start position:0%
great also is it possible to see a
spreadsheet<00:19:53.360><c> that</c><00:19:53.600><c> shows</c><00:19:54.000><c> the</c><00:19:54.480><c> formula</c><00:19:55.039><c> that</c>

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that shows the formula that
 

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.029 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that shows the formula that
you<00:19:55.360><c> use</c><00:19:55.760><c> based</c><00:19:56.000><c> on</c><00:19:56.160><c> that</c><00:19:56.320><c> day's</c><00:19:56.559><c> acuity</c><00:19:56.960><c> and</c>

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
you use based on that day's acuity and
 

00:19:57.039 --> 00:19:58.230 align:start position:0%
you use based on that day's acuity and
all<00:19:57.120><c> those</c><00:19:57.280><c> kinds</c><00:19:57.440><c> of</c><00:19:57.520><c> things</c><00:19:57.760><c> just</c><00:19:57.919><c> get</c><00:19:58.080><c> a</c>

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
all those kinds of things just get a
 

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.510 align:start position:0%
all those kinds of things just get a
feel<00:19:58.480><c> for</c>

00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
feel for
 

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.029 align:start position:0%
feel for
how<00:19:59.679><c> that</c><00:19:59.919><c> actually</c><00:20:00.160><c> all</c>

00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
how that actually all
 

00:20:01.039 --> 00:20:05.350 align:start position:0%
how that actually all
absolutely<00:20:01.360><c> rolls</c><00:20:01.760><c> up</c>

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.070 align:start position:0%
 
we<00:20:05.520><c> have</c><00:20:05.760><c> definitely</c><00:20:06.159><c> documents</c><00:20:06.880><c> but</c>

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
we have definitely documents but
 

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.190 align:start position:0%
we have definitely documents but
a<00:20:08.240><c> spreadsheet</c><00:20:08.720><c> would</c><00:20:08.799><c> be</c><00:20:08.960><c> a</c><00:20:08.960><c> little</c><00:20:09.120><c> bit</c>

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet would be a little bit
 

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.870 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet would be a little bit
challenging<00:20:09.600><c> but</c><00:20:09.760><c> i</c><00:20:09.840><c> have</c><00:20:10.080><c> documents</c><00:20:10.640><c> that</c><00:20:10.720><c> we</c>

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
challenging but i have documents that we
 

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.630 align:start position:0%
challenging but i have documents that we
can<00:20:11.039><c> show</c><00:20:11.360><c> that</c><00:20:11.520><c> walks</c><00:20:11.840><c> through</c><00:20:12.000><c> the</c><00:20:12.080><c> whole</c>

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
can show that walks through the whole
 

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.230 align:start position:0%
can show that walks through the whole
process<00:20:13.120><c> it's</c><00:20:13.280><c> all</c><00:20:13.440><c> written</c><00:20:13.760><c> in</c><00:20:13.840><c> our</c><00:20:14.000><c> state</c>

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
process it's all written in our state
 

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.190 align:start position:0%
process it's all written in our state
plan

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
plan
 

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.270 align:start position:0%
plan
um<00:20:16.000><c> and</c><00:20:16.240><c> it's</c>

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
um and it's
 

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.590 align:start position:0%
um and it's
it's<00:20:17.520><c> a</c><00:20:17.600><c> little</c><00:20:17.760><c> bit</c><00:20:17.919><c> complicated</c><00:20:18.720><c> because</c><00:20:19.039><c> it</c>

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit complicated because it
 

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.149 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit complicated because it
depends<00:20:20.080><c> on</c><00:20:20.400><c> like</c><00:20:20.960><c> costs</c><00:20:21.360><c> and</c><00:20:21.520><c> cost</c><00:20:21.760><c> reports</c>

00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
depends on like costs and cost reports

00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
but if they didn't you know if you then
 

00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:20.390 align:start position:0%
but if they didn't you know if you then
you<00:26:18.960><c> run</c><00:26:19.200><c> the</c><00:26:19.279><c> risk</c><00:26:19.520><c> that</c><00:26:19.600><c> you're</c><00:26:19.760><c> pro</c><00:26:20.000><c> share</c>
