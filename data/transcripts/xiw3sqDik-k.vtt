00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.110 align:start position:0%
successful day yesterday and and are all

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
happy who yeah we Jane's the only one
 
00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 align:start position:0%
not coming back
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
right okay so what we're going to do
 
00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
today what uh the pending motions that
 
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
when we finally do exec these bills is
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
recommended or not recommended for
 
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.309 align:start position:0%
recommended or not recommended for
future

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
legislation they took away several years
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
ago uh the opportunity to um say
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
recommended with
 
00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment which that then opened up the
 
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a lot of discussion and
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of you know detailed work and
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
stuff like that so um they don't have
 
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
that anymore uh that means that to
 
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation means
 
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
that the bill as written is it perfect
 
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0%
and ready for prime time which of course
 
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
that would be almost
 
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
impossible uh because we inter room
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
study it for a reason because it wasn't
 
00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time uh so my
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
expectation is that everything is
 
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
eventually going to be interim study but
 
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
I want to use these two days or to uh
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
flush out things that people would like
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
to have a discussion on and that is I
 
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
want to treat it as though it was a
 
00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:32.879 align:start position:0%
chapter study so that people can have
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
time to spend to work on that subject uh
 
00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
those who are interested in and getting
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
and in passing that um and but knowing
 
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
in at the end it's going to be the the
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
final motion would be not recommended
 
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
but at least gives everybody an
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity because I when as you
 
00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
remember when we um last this past year
 
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
when we talked about bills of being in
 
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
interim study them we were saying but
 
00:07:58.589 --> 00:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
are we really going to study them so and
 
00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
this is the moment where that is this is
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
where you have to say yes okay we really
 
00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:04.919 align:start position:0%
do want to study it we really want to
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
think more about it and and you're
 
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
willing to come in another day and cut
 
00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:10.919 align:start position:0%
out your campaign
 
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
time to come in here and want to work on
 
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
that issue because you care about the
 
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
issue and you think it's something
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's worth working on does that make
 
00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:21.639 align:start position:0%
sense what do you think
 
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:25.240 align:start position:0%
um I know we can't reintroduce a bill
 
00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
next if if you modify it enough can you
 
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
re put in a new bill it doesn't matter
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
you and in terms that's very good
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
question yeah everything is fair game
 
00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:38.519 align:start position:0%
okay for next session okay okay words
 
00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:40.519 align:start position:0%
you can you can you can introduce the
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
exact same language right as word for
 
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
word um obviously it will if the
 
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
conversation comes up with well did you
 
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
put this in last year and what was the
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
motion well it was not recommended by
 
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:55.240 align:start position:0%
this committee but you're that you know
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
we this committee cannot bind the makeup
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
of what this committe is going to look
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
like come January
 
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
yep okay everybody clear good all right
 
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:07.240 align:start position:0%
so what I'm going to do is to go over
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
Woodstock uh this this bill was
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
originally um uh forwarded to this
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
committee I was the uh Prime sponsor of
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
it the primary goal was to um uh help um
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
restaurant lodging and other businesses
 
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
in the area that are having a difficult
 
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.949 align:start position:0%
in the area that are having a difficult
time

00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:29.959 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh with misbranding of service animals
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
or or animals that uh aren't service
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
animals and creating havoc in some of
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
establishments uh as as we know in the
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony was that um uh that
 
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
we're pretty handcuffed on what new
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
regulations we can create by federal law
 
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
um there's um you know while you've been
 
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
studying it in this learned committee I
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
um a few things that I just want wanted
 
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
to share uh based on feedback that I've
 
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
gotten from local uh restaurants and uh
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
um uh hotels and campgrounds is that um
 
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
that what they thought would be helpful
 
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
would be um uh uh information that to
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
help facilitate a dialogue with somebody
 
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
who wants to use their facility and um
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
um there is there is one short form that
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
talks about that they can post and put
 
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
on their wall saying you know it's a
 
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
violation to Mis brand your dog and say
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
it's a service dog when it's not and
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
subject to a $500 fine that's gotten a
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
little bit of help in creating that um
 
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
uh but um more recently you know we
 
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
talked about just having a form they
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
said okay you want to bring a service
 
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
dog in um it doesn't seem like there's
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
any restriction in federal law to
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
prevent you from asking them to fill out
 
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
a form form that doesn't ask any
 
00:12:04.509 --> 00:12:04.519 align:start position:0%
questions that um uh are prohibited by
 
00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
federal law so um what I did was create
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
a sample Hospitality form um it might be
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
different you know this problem also
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
extends over to hospitals too by the way
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
and um um you know if there are if if
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
there aren't other recommendations what
 
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
I would suggest is that uh that there
 
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
just be a referral to the Department of
 
00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:28.519 align:start position:0%
Agriculture who I believe is the entity
 
00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:29.959 align:start position:0%
in charge of
 
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
of uh local laws that they create uh and
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh check in checkin forms that comply
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
with uh New Hampshire state and federal
 
00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:41.839 align:start position:0%
service animal access requirements and
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
then report back uh to Commerce and
 
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps myself on whether any bills uh
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
would be uh needed or recommended uh to
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
be able to put forward some kind of uh
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
checklist like that so uh the front the
 
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
so that's that's uh I guess you know um
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
my activities outside of the inter room
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
study I guess that's that's as far as um
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
that I've been able to progress with it
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to share that with the
 
00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
committee and and if you thought it was
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
a good idea to make a referral I'd app I
 
00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:16.839 align:start position:0%
I'm I would be supportive of
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
that great uh representative burrow has
 
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
a question thanks thanks for taking my
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
question um representative if a if a
 
00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
restaurant or facility gave you this
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
form would it be a mandate that you sign
 
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:31.240 align:start position:0%
it that you fill this out before your
 
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
animal came
 
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
in um I guess I would ask for I I I
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
think it's reasonable to ask them to
 
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
sign it um but I mean would your law
 
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
mandate at and if not why do we need a
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
law to do
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
this right that that may be right and I
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
mean because a restaurant can just hand
 
00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:54.069 align:start position:0%
mean because a restaurant can just hand
this

00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
out well I I do think it would be nice
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
if they're going to hand it out that at
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
least be that the state um make a uh uh
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
that the questions are reasonable and
 
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
comply with state and federal law but we
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
don't need a laot to for them to do that
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
it it it we that's true we might not
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
that's why you know I said in there that
 
00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
uh uh report back whether legislation is
 
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
needed or not so if it's not required or
 
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
if they can't require it then maybe it
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't if it if they can require it
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
then maybe it does I don't know that
 
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
might be the answer representative Gibbs
 
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
thank you uh this is more a comment than
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
a question um because this was actually
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
part of my my field um as a civil rights
 
00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:42.759 align:start position:0%
uh law enforcement officer uh both for
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
the state and then for the federal
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
government and I think it's problematic
 
00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:51.399 align:start position:0%
to require um a person with a disability
 
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
to uh write down what service their uh
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
service animal performs and sign off on
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
it it is true that this uh to be a
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
service animal the the animal has to
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
perform a specific service it can't be
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
just an emotional support animal that's
 
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
quite correct um but it would not be
 
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
legal for instance to require a person
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
with a disability to write down what
 
00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
their disability is and I think
 
00:15:20.749 --> 00:15:20.759 align:start position:0%
similarly requiring the person with a
 
00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
disability to write down and sign off on
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
what service the animal performs I think
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
that's problematic and I'm not not sure
 
00:15:32.189 --> 00:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
that would be legal yeah um and you know
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer but I I did know that
 
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
um uh pretty much the only thing they're
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to ask is what function yeah
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
what function does the service animal
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
provide for you and that's and virtually
 
00:15:47.949 --> 00:15:47.959 align:start position:0%
every restaurant and hotel that I've
 
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
talked to about it understand that's
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
pretty much all they can ask and right
 
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
and that's Federal that's the federal so
 
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
regulations you tell us what the trick
 
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
okay great and uh there's one other
 
00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
thanks good morning morning I need oh

I live in D New Hampshire and i r
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
present the nonprofit organization
 
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
called the New Hampshire Coalition for
 
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:09.079 align:start position:0%
the support of service dogs and what we
 
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
do is we provide financial aid to people
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
with service dogs New Hampshire and also
 
00:17:20.429 --> 00:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
another one of our focuses is on
 
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
education and advocacy and so I wanted
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
to be here today to share my thoughts
 
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.350 align:start position:0%
 
bill

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
um my my dad brought some uh things to
 
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
hand out to you um I did some pretty
 
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.909 --> 00:18:08.919 align:start position:0%
um as as you can see there are already
 
00:18:08.919 --> 00:18:09.990 align:start position:0%
um as as you can see there are already
pretty

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
stringent uh service doog laws in New
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and my question
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
is um do
 
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
businesses not know the two questions
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
they can ask
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
um which
 
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:57.070 align:start position:0%
 
here

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:01.149 --> 00:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
oh anyway I I know them um the uh is it
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
a service dog and what what tasks is it
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
trained to
 
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
perform and I think the the main
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
solution to this problem is um requiring
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
businesses to ask those questions and
 
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.789 align:start position:0%
businesses to ask those questions and
also

00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:29.799 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if the businesses know
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
that if the dog is Miss behaving at all
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039 align:start position:0%
removed great thank you uh would you be
 
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
willing to take a question yeah
 
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
okay I was just thank you for for coming
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
and uh answering our questions I was
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
just curious about your organization
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
could you tell us about your your
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
organization for service dogs yes so my
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
organization provides financial aid to
 
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
people in theal with service dogs um uh
 
00:20:17.789 --> 00:20:17.799 align:start position:0%
uh for example like if your service dog
 
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
needs like emergency surgery you can
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
apply to us for our grant to help with
 
00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:30.310 align:start position:0%
apply to us for our grant to help with
that

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
yeah represent thank you I I have one
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
question um you said that we can ask
 
00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:39.559 align:start position:0%
these two questions which is great cuz I
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
actually work um at an ice cream shop
 
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
and there's people always bringing their
 
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
dogs in and we're never sure how to deal
 
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
with this so this is really informative
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
to me personally um when people come in
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
with a service dog on it but then it's
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
some sort of an emotional support dog
 
00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
what would what would be an approp roate
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
answer for them if I would ask what
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
they're trained to do cuz that seems
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
like that's not a service dog per se
 
00:21:05.149 --> 00:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
that might be something different or
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
maybe you would know yeah that's not
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
serves dog okay so an emotional support
 
00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
dog wouldn't need to be yes accepted
 
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
into an establishment so the difference
 
00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:17.559 align:start position:0%
between service dogs and emotional SW
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
dogs is that um service dogs are covered
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
under the Ada and they have access
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
rights pretty much anywhere okay great
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
that's very help emotional Sheriff's
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
much y uh thank you uh again thank you
 
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
for asking our questions just my
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
question is you are giving funds to
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
folks who have service dogs if they
 
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
request them uh what is the source of
 
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.669 align:start position:0%
request them uh what is the source of
your

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:32.200 align:start position:0%
you have any more questions please feel
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
free to shoot me an
 
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
email yeah I just do would you okay I
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
just looked up because I was curious
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
what airlines do in terms of emotional
 
00:22:46.269 --> 00:22:46.279 align:start position:0%
support Dr dogs and they're treated as
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
pets and they get to charge a fee to fly
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
with them and they're not obligated to
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
allow them on board so it seems like
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
beable do you agree with
 
00:22:59.549 --> 00:22:59.559 align:start position:0%
that and that's um the other thing was
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
service dogs it's
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
um um so
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
um so with with emotional support
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
animals it is an
 
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
individual uh Airline
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
decision representative
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you uh just for
 
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
clarification on the difference between
 
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.200 align:start position:0%
emotional support animals and service
 
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
animals um emotional support animals are
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
covered under the fair housing act so
 
00:23:33.149 --> 00:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
they have to be allowed in apartments
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
but uh their emotional support animals
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
are not covered under the Ada so they
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
don't have to be allowed in restaurants
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
or on public transportation such as
 
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
Airlines or trains uh public
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
transportation and restaurants and
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
public accommodations only have to allow
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
service animals that are trained to do a
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
specific function
 
00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%

some bills here that people are going to
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%

deals in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%

issues that people have with changing
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%

propane or oil so um happy to answer any
 
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
questions in case there's a technical
 
00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
one I didn't know I asked Leslie to come
 
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
um when we testified am meras was for
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
sale and we thought maybe they wouldn't
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
be operating in the state of New
 
00:27:00.909 --> 00:27:00.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire anymore but that sale fell
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
through so um put it right on the table
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
because that's what we thought was going
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
to happen before the state in front of
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
you now but it did not so um so there's
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
any questions on that I'll have you ask
 
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
Miss Anderson but um that's kind of a
 
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
quick summary of Where where why we
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
think this bill doesn't need to move
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
forward thank
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you uh with respect to the
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
fact that air gas has not been sold are
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
they is there going to be any scrutiny
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
within the industry to keep them from
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
doing the crazy stuff that they were
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
doing is crazy
 
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
allowed that there definitely um 18
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
months ago was was quite a bit of
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
disarray at that company and um I
 
00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:52.519 align:start position:0%
reached out at the time higher up of the
 
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
company had had them commit resources to
 
00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:57.519 align:start position:0%
the state to go out and pick up tanks
 
00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
they had lots of tanks that have been
 
00:28:00.669 --> 00:28:00.679 align:start position:0%
sitting at customer locations for two
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
long periods of time uh they had
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
Workforce issues and and they had
 
00:28:07.149 --> 00:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
management issues that they've addressed
 
00:28:09.549 --> 00:28:09.559 align:start position:0%
and the number of of complaints has
 
00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
dropped significantly and the tanks have
 
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
been picked up uh and they they actually
 
00:28:16.269 --> 00:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
hired contractors to go out and assist
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
with their their own staff to get that
 
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
done so that that problem has been
 
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
resolved I have two very strong contacts
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
at a maragas that will take care of any
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
issue when I call with a customer issue
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
isue now and I am not calling in the
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
frequency that I was 18 months ago so I
 
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
believe that they're on a better path
 
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
forward um the propane business is
 
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
competitive so if you're not happy with
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
your your customer you can leave and we
 
00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:45.519 align:start position:0%
have you know another 70 customers
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
companies to choose from pretty much in
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
the state um a lot of people have chosen
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
other companies and and gone with them
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
as as happens when you have poor
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
customer service so uh our role though
 
00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
with with both of our associations is to
 
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.360 align:start position:0%

complaints you know which is way down
 
00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
from from what it was before I was
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
getting two complaints a week uh 18
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
months ago when when the problem with
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
the maragas happened before they came in
 
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
and and put resources in and resolve the
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
issue and you said two this summer two
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
I've had two since this summer okay
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
yeah just a drop obviously yeah so yeah
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
represent for two second thank you Mr
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
chair I have a like a consumer question
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
um I've been watching uh the price of uh
 
00:30:20.669 --> 00:30:20.679 align:start position:0%
G uh propane natural gas uh On The Wall
 
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
Street Journal it keeps
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
dropping uh if I have a contract with
 
00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:28.519 align:start position:0%
you for x
 
00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
doar per whatever 500 what when I
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
exercise that
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
contract would I get the updated reduced
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
cost uh if I was you know I was quoted
 
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
six months ago I get it tomorrow do I
 
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
get the the reduced cost of today's
 
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
price or do I stay with the original
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
contract price so it depends what type
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
of contract you enter with them there's
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
different options that you have as a
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
customer some people pre- buby where
 
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
they come in and they say I'm going to
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
buy all of my product for the year I'm
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
going to buy it in the summertime the
 
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
the company actually goes out and buys
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
it on the Futures Market as well so
 
00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:12.519 align:start position:0%
there's a little fee associated with
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
that but you get that low summertime
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
price there's also um cap prices so
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
what's most common in the industry is
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
your company will say I'm going to quote
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
you this amount of product that's the
 
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
cap that's the max it will go but if it
 
00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
goes lower you'll get the lower price so
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
you'll get the price of the day so it
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
depends which contract you sign up with
 
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
with your your your company or if you
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
own your own tanks and you're just
 
00:31:38.669 --> 00:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
calling and around in shopping price and
 
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
then having somebody come deliver
 
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to give you the price that
 
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
they can give you that day you know or
 
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
that delivery day when they come out and
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
deliver to you thank you I was just I
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
was just curious thank you very much the
 
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
more you use the lower the price because
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
we have to go out in an extremely
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
expensive truck and deliver it to your
 
00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
driveway and and often in the winter
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
time and up a hill and there's ice and
 
00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:03.559 align:start position:0%
everything else um so you know if if
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's if it's something the company can
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
schedule when they they're in that area
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
and they can make a larger Delivery drop
 
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
their costs for delivery are lower so
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
cost great thank you thank you is there
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
anybody else who would like toh speak on
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
1395 seeing none we'll move on to the
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
next subject uh Senate Bill 9 seven rela
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%

00:32:53.389 --> 00:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
97 FB Senate bill so this bill has been
 
00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
around but what what happened and just
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
quickly to refresh refesh people's
 
00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
memories if they have any memory of this
 
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
at the very end uh right before you had
 
00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:06.679 align:start position:0%
to sign off on
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
bills uh uh the Humane Society in
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College along with Senator
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
Waters and some of you uh rewrote the
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
bill to provide
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
biomed devices to be tested on when they
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
needed to be with animals the whole
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
concept of this bill is if there's a
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
better way to test
 
00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
products in New Hampshire without using
 
00:33:37.149 --> 00:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
animals we should use them that is what
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
this is about we agreed with Dartmouth
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
College that we would cover biomed
 
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
devices here and also that if a product
 
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
is approved for use with a biomed device
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
that does not mean that it would be
 
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
approved for another use that is not
 
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
biomedical so that language is in there
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
added in there as well that's what we're
 
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
asking what we're asking for is whatever
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
study is done recommend that the
 
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
language that we came up with is okay to
 
00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
move forward in a new bill in the next
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
session that's the gist of why I'm here
 
00:34:20.829 --> 00:34:20.839 align:start position:0%
today but isn't that already federal
 
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
law that you had that you're supposed to
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
try to find some other way to do it
 
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
before you no test an animal no it's not
 
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
we that's why we need to do it in the
 
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
States because there is no federal law
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
there's a p there my understanding right
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
now and is there is pending legislation
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
that is not ping okay not able to get
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
passed okay so we need to do it for the
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
animals New Hampshire and to set a
 
00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
precedent that you know we don't want to
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
test on animals unnecessarily in New
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's what this bill is about
 
00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
and is there any testing going on in New
 
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at all well clearly there is
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
because outh college is interested in
 
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
this bill no they were just worried
 
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
about the language they were looking
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the way the bill was written
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
that there's a reason it's a reason
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
they're extremely interested in this and
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
that is because there's a potential for
 
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
it if not potential the fact that it's
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
going on now I don't know that okay fair
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
enough representative spear that was my
 
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:22.839 align:start position:0%
question because I remember at the at
 
00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
the uh when we we met last time on this
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
bill we couldn't find any in inces where
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
the animals were being used for testing
 
00:35:33.069 --> 00:35:33.079 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire other than
 
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
what was going on at
 
00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth and I I guess that's still
 
00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.670 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth and I I guess that's still
true

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
right okay well I just just to close
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
that we want to make sure it doesn't
 
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
happen ever I think we all would agree
 
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
on that right well I I have an
 
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
expression for that that I was taught by
 
00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
Neil Kirk who was former chairman of the
 
00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
finance committee and he calls that
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
source thank you very much aren't dogs
 
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
and cats being
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:13.119 --> 00:36:17.069 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:17.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
right um but I am told it's still a
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
specialty there in in China Oh I thought
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
it was in Colorado no I no but that's
 
00:36:27.069 --> 00:36:27.079 align:start position:0%
what they're saying is but I I always
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
thought it was
 
00:36:32.589 --> 00:36:32.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
delicacy okay uh moving right along so
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any other comments on
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
that bill thing okay moving right on

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
devices great welcome I assume you're
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
from the Department
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Brian Allard uh
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
assistant director with the State Fire
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
Marshall's office Fire Marshall right um
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
good morning Marshall to me apologize he
 
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
wish he could be here today uh just to
 
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
make a few comments um our whole goal in
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
the fire Marshalls Office is to keep
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
people safe and try to mitigate any
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
fires uh by any means possible uh we
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
have over the last five years seen an
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
increase in uh lithium ion battery fires
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
and batter uh caused significant damages
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
to homes fortunately no loss of life as
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
of yet uh we think that having a
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
national or International uh thirdparty
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
and uh inspection of these batteries
 
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
prior to sale and labeling of those
 
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
would be prudent uh and uh keeping our
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
safe okay representa
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
Pier what I remember from this bill when
 
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
we we talked about it last time was
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
trying to find the iso standard for
 
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
these kind of batteries and that was
 
00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
what was missing for me is that I wanted
 
00:37:59.550 --> 00:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
an international ISO standard did we
 
00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
ever find one and I I think I even
 
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
listed one at the time uh thank you for
 
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
your question I know there was a
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
submission by a b people for bicycles uh
 
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
to the to this committee and they they
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
do list the uh the iso standard in there
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
is is that an update to the to the uh to
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
the bill or well I mean like again this
 
00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
pill is in limbo land right now it's in
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
limbo but they they did Supply that
 
00:38:29.309 --> 00:38:29.319 align:start position:0%
specific language is if anybody were to
 
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
put this bill back in again next year
 
00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
that would be in there you want to make
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
sure that's in there absolutely okay and
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
we agree so um of the fires that we had
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
had any of those fires occurred by a a a
 
00:38:46.109 --> 00:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
battery that uh wasn't certified
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
already so hard to tell right because
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
that the batteries are typically
 
00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
destroyed so when we go in and do our
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
investigations you know we're asking the
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
homeowners the business owners kind of
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
what was in this area and try to narrow
 
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
down to that point of origin uh and
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
typically when we do find the batteries
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
they're totally destroyed so we can't
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
actually read if they are
 
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
labeled okay how do I ask this question
 
00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.790 align:start position:0%
labeled okay how do I ask this question
differently

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
differently
 
00:39:14.109 --> 00:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
um do you have any evidence that there
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
is a third-party battery that that's not
 
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
standard floating around in this
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
state sorry can you availability other
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
words said somebody could get a battery
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
I mean my experience when it comes to
 
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:30.200 align:start position:0%
batteries that especially with the bikes
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
because my wife sist getting one this
 
00:39:36.309 --> 00:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
year is that the battery is designed so
 
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
can only fit theirs it's you know like
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
they almost have a patent on the way the
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
battery fits in and how it's done so I
 
00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:47.079 align:start position:0%
guess I want to know is is are there
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
third you know when I say third party or
 
00:39:53.069 --> 00:39:53.079 align:start position:0%
is there a non-manufactured approved
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
battery for any device around that
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
that's that have you ever seen any
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
evidence of one that did not have a
 
00:40:02.309 --> 00:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
sticker have have have one of these
 
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
approvals on it there there are uh uh
 
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:07.640 align:start position:0%
times where there are unapproved
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
batteries being sold within the state so
 
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
those typically may have a higher
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
probability of not not being tested to a
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
certain standard obviously and those
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
have been shown not so much in our state
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
that we have evidence of but other
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
states uh that have caught
 
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
fire okay but you don't we don't have
 
00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
any any evidence yet not conclusive that
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
that I could say here today correct okay
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
spear like you we've gone out and bought
 
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
the electric bikes and if you're going
 
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
to spend $4 or $5,000 on an electric
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
bike you're going to get a nice battery
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
that goes with it but in looking at them
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
we found $800 bikes that had batteries
 
00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
in them that you had no idea what those
 
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
batteries were the bikes were pretty
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
cheaply made and the batteries were
 
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
worse so they may not be third party
 
00:40:59.710 --> 00:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
Replacements but I think there are bikes
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
being sold that are in I don't think
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
they belong on the road that that
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
they're pretty bad and like three $800
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
$400 you know I don't I think we maybe
 
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
need to do
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
something okay
 
00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
for answering our questions just for my
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
own curiosity there are different size
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
batteries right so there are those
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
little battery packs that you get to
 
00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:27.640 align:start position:0%
recharge your cell phone electric bikes
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
test those electric cars which category
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
of battery is the most problematic
 
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
that's my question uh great question
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so in our so
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
we collect data from all fire
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
departments throughout the uh State
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
and there's not typically a drop down
 
00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:47.480 align:start position:0%
specifically says lithium ion battery so
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
we have to do searches through their
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
narratives and through other parts of
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
the reports so the highest one um
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
happens to happens to be with u 8 p
 
00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
are the are the highest ones and then we
 
00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
go down to ebikes there's some hybrid
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles in there we're talking all of
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
all electric type batteries and then
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
kind of other category so forther
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
question me inquire thank you um I guess
 
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
this is what you believe there's a
 
00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
disturbing video
 
00:42:22.549 --> 00:42:22.559 align:start position:0%
online uh
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
Sur so it's uh it's three dogs alone at
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
home and they have a nanny cam on the
 
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
dogs and one of the dogs gets a hold of
 
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
one of these rechargeable battery packs
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
bites into it it catches on fire and
 
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
lights the whole living room on fire I I
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
don't know what happened to the dogs I
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
assume they got out safely but uh is
 
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
there a problem with uh you know if you
 
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
damage one of these does is it more
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
likely to catch on fire whether it's ice
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
ISO approved or not yeah thank you for
 
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
your question I have not seen that video
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
but I've seen others like that and yes
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
there is definitely a higher probability
 
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
if those battery packs are damaged um
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
that they can catch fire in some of
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
those videos you probably saw like a
 
00:43:08.109 --> 00:43:08.119 align:start position:0%
huge uh what they call thermal runaway
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
kind of coming right out and it will
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
ignite a room and contents very
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
quickly and they stay on fire longer
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
right well don't airplanes you know the
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
airlines don't let you bring on those
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
skateboards or whatever the with the
 
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
batteries or the lithium battery I
 
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
believe that to be the case yeah and
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
they have they have so they so they just
 
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
don't they just ban it all together
 
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
right is that what they're yeah um I
 
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
guess I I feel compelled to say um years
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
ago uh I mean I'm probably unusual that
 
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
um we had these uh St Charles cabinets
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
built into our house which are steel
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
cabinets and uh they Pro is that they're
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
last forever real great and whatever the
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
company's now since gone out of business
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
but but to make a long story short um I
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
was reading an article that said watch
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
out for your 9V
 
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
battery because the 9vt battery has both
 
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
ends right next to each other and that
 
00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
if you have metal drawers metal C and if
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
those battery gets connect touches it it
 
00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.109 align:start position:0%
those battery gets connect touches it it
will

00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
spark do we have any statue now that
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
regulates those batteries or 9vt
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
batteries or is it Federal does Federal
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
Regulation or anything exist now to uh
 
00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
make sure those batteries are done
 
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
safely or packaged safely or what is
 
00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
there anything on the books already uh
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
that that theory makes sense um but I'm
 
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
not sure if there's any uh regulation on
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
those on 9vt batteries yeah generally I
 
00:44:46.349 --> 00:44:46.359 align:start position:0%
don't like to reinvent the wheel so if
 
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
that really was a problem I'd be
 
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
interested to know how how that got
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
resolved so but warning to everybody if
 
00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
you have metal cab metal
 
00:44:59.069 --> 00:44:59.079 align:start position:0%
drawers uh thank you Mr chairman does
 
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
this apply to other devices I've got a
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
number of household devices including a
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
a a charger that'll start my car that's
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
only this big uh I've got a electric
 
00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
wheelbarrow um I a little nervous about
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
storing those in the house uh any advice
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
on how you store
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
those uh thank you thank you for your
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
question I can only give you my personal
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
what i t what I do for at home so I have
 
00:45:28.549 --> 00:45:28.559 align:start position:0%
we battery op weed whacker and lawn
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
tools outside I had an old safe um and I
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
actually store them in there in my barn
 
00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
I value my barn I don't want anything to
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
happen to it uh so I keep them in in the
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
safe so they're protected so if they do
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
have and watch out for that metal safe
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
don't let those ends touch it uh so I'm
 
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
hoping to you know limit my exposure and
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
keep that keep those in there so that's
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
what I do what I personally do at homes
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
I don't have a great answer for you but
 
00:45:55.040 --> 00:46:00.230 align:start position:0%
I don't have a great answer for you but
that's

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
played golf with somebody this summer
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
who who had one of those remote control
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
golf golf Walker you know walk and walks
 
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
his bag around and need to say I'm sure
 
00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
that had lithium batteries in it I'm
 
00:46:12.839 --> 00:46:13.790 align:start position:0%
that had lithium batteries in it I'm
sure

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
sir uh and that is it on my list um all
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
right so now I want to go through the
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
list let's talk about from the members
 
00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee which bills that uh
 
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
people would like to uh spend some more
 
00:46:39.069 --> 00:46:39.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
bill yeah I I have two I'd like to
 
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
comment on but I don't know how much
 
00:46:44.829 --> 00:46:44.839 align:start position:0%
time to spend on it if you want to well
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
I mean what I'm looking for is bills
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
that you want to
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
um uh have a subcommittee
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
on to a
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
sub this is my my my idea and maybe I'll
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
be overruled but it's 1232 all right and
 
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.589 align:start position:0%
be overruled but it's 1232 all right and
1674

00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
okay and you would like to have
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
some uh a study committee that you know
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
spend some time working on these
 
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:17.720 align:start position:0%
issues uh I think it would be valuable
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
but like I said it's up to the the
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
committee and what whatever no it's
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
people ask you why do I keep running for
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
the house and I said well you when
 
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
you're a chair it's it's pry chair the
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
chair decides whether you're gonna have
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee yeah chair the chair
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
decide appoints subcommittees the chair
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
and decide I I'm not talking no you know
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
you could decide whether we do it or not
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
do a subcommittee but in terms of the
 
00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:51.880 align:start position:0%
actual vote on the bill when it comes
 
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
out of that that but yeah no the
 
00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
chairman chairman appoints subcommittees
 
00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
or decide whether it's going to be one
 
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
or not something to look forward to
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
huh so you're taking comments now I am
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
taking comments on these two bills which
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
ones I didn't even hear 1232 and 1674
 
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
and when I say committee I was using the
 
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.069 --> 00:48:23.079 align:start position:0%
yeah so and you're asking us for our
 
00:48:25.549 --> 00:48:25.559 align:start position:0%
comments okay so next is once we once
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go forward and say yes so
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
now I'm interested in who would like to
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
be on this subcommittee so having two
 
00:48:33.549 --> 00:48:33.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and you want to know I
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
think they they can be done at the same
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
time right they'll be scheduled at the
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
same time and in terms of when they get
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
scheduled uh that will be up to to Keith
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
to schedule them because I'm going to
 
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
point them chair this this is a comment
 
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
yes we've done 1232 now for two
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
years how much more studying are we
 
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
going to do on this and in that and in
 
00:48:59.069 --> 00:48:59.079 align:start position:0%
addition to that some of us have read
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
5,000 pages of information from the
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve indicating what their
 
00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
plans are most of which are they're not
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
going to do
 
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
anything so talking about your
 
00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.829 align:start position:0%
anything so talking about your
prophylactic

00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
prophylactic
 
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
bills which I know are your
 
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
favorites how much more studying can we
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
do on something other than reading 5,000
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
Pages put your mic on and the ball is
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
now in your court so there there is uh
 
00:49:27.599 --> 00:49:28.910 align:start position:0%
now in your court so there there is uh
intervening

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
intervening
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
information um that we can talk about in
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
the in the subcommittee but I'll give
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
you one example okay so North
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
Carolina just passed the bill I'm
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
1232 very similar to 1232 they just
 
00:49:46.549 --> 00:49:46.559 align:start position:0%
passed it the governor vetoed it they
 
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
overrode The veto so overwhelming
 
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
majority of the the North
 
00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
Carolina legislature passed a very
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
similar bill in 1232 that's happened
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
since we talked about it so and that's
 
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
fine one example there's states that do
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
that states do all kinds of things
 
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
including this state have passed laws
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
that are very strange just because the
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
state passed the law doesn't mean
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's any validity to the fact that we
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
have to research it again I'll give you
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:25.720 align:start position:0%
Association issued a policy paper
 
00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
opposing a central bank digital currency
 
00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:30.839 align:start position:0%
that's happened since we and I read it I
 
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
read that and the situation that we have
 
00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
there is that the Federal Reserve says
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
they are really not interested in
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
issuing such a currency that flat out
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
not interest now remember well I I I I
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
guess I want to intervene here all right
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
in my
 
00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
mind even if we were to pass the law
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
we'll have no control over a federal
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
agency we don't okay so in my mind
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
forget about the Federal you know it it
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
it you know it says the way the bill is
 
00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:03.640 align:start position:0%
written says prohibit state or local
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay we're not talking about Federal
 
00:51:08.349 --> 00:51:08.359 align:start position:0%
here it is talking about whether we
 
00:51:08.359 --> 00:51:09.230 align:start position:0%
here it is talking about whether we
would

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:51:11.789 --> 00:51:11.799 align:start position:0%
allow either the state of New Hampshire
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
or a local
 
00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
government to use a bank digital
 
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
currency so I'm sure that's what they
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
passed there and but look what you're
 
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
saying yes look what you're saying if
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve and they don't
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
intend to but if the Federal Reserve did
 
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
Issue a digital
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
currency that you would be prohibiting
 
00:51:39.549 --> 00:51:39.559 align:start position:0%
people from this state for using it what
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
kind of a thing is that again this
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
legislation does not say make any
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
reference to Federal this legislation
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh do I have it in front of me no I
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
don't have it in front of me but all I'm
 
00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
just reading from the title the title
 
00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
says prohibit state or local read B I
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
don't see I don't see it saying Federal
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
read the bill okay so but you're can
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
still concern about Federal um I I my
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
concern in terms of state or local you
 
00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
know to me this is what would your
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
interpretation this is prophylactic
 
00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
okay to representative Spears point that
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
the FED currently says they will not
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
issue a digital currency
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
I would use the example of
 
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
History which is relative pardon me
 
00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.470 align:start position:0%
History which is relative pardon me
relatively

00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
relatively
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
recent uh in the Nicks Administration we
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
were on the gold standard until tell
 
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
midnight on Friday when we
 
00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
weren't and we were on the same thing
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
can be said about the silver standard we
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
were on the silver standard until
 
00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:55.720 align:start position:0%
midnight on Friday when we weren't they
 
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
do not give you
 
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
6 months 6 weeks or 6 hours of advanced
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
notice of change of
 
00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
currency I think that this is absolutely
 
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
prophylactic uh
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm not sure whether it I'm
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
not sure how I feel about
 
00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
it uh and I'm not sure I want to would
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
want to inflict a subcommittee on
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
somebody on it but I don't think it's
 
00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:25.640 align:start position:0%
going to go away and I think it is a
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
relevant topic for this legislature to
 
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
consider either now or in the very
 
00:53:30.839 --> 00:53:35.109 align:start position:0%
consider either now or in the very
foreseeable

00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
future um would the bankers Association
 
00:53:46.349 --> 00:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
one that is a no can you at least
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
support my statement that the American
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
Bankers Association came out against the
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
retail cbdc okay thank you okay that
 
00:53:58.349 --> 00:53:58.359 align:start position:0%
isn't what happened I read it that is
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
not exactly what happened what happened
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
is they came the FED came out with a
 
00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
list of questions 20 pages of questions
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
and the bankers Association came out
 
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
with their response to those 20 qu to
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
those 20 questions and in the in their
 
00:54:14.789 --> 00:54:14.799 align:start position:0%
response they said well we don't like
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
this part of it we don't like that part
 
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
of it but we like this other part and
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
maybe this other part so it's not like
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
they said because the because the feds
 
00:54:24.789 --> 00:54:24.799 align:start position:0%
have not come out with what it looks
 
00:54:26.829 --> 00:54:26.839 align:start position:0%
like they don't know what it looks like
 
00:54:28.589 --> 00:54:28.599 align:start position:0%
have made no decisions as to what it
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
looks like and in fact have said they
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
may not ever make it at at the retail
 
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
level where we would ever see it it may
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
be just bank to bank is one of the
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
things they were talking about so just
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
saying that they're against it that's
 
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
not exactly what happened at
 
00:54:46.829 --> 00:54:46.839 align:start position:0%
all okay representative
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
Gibbs uh thank you um in reference to uh
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
whether this uh statute would have any
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
have any reference to any think Federal
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't Central Bank refer to the
 
00:55:02.589 --> 00:55:02.599 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve and in that case
 
00:55:05.069 --> 00:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't such a statute put state and
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
local governments in in conflict with an
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
agency of the federal
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
government I have a response for that I
 
00:55:14.589 --> 00:55:14.599 align:start position:0%
I would have to look at the bill and see
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
what it had for
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
definitions comment please okay so um
 
00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
obviously this bill needs a little more
 
00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:27.589 align:start position:0%
obviously this bill needs a little more
discussion

00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.029 --> 00:55:29.039 align:start position:0%
I I get that there's opposition to
 
00:55:31.029 --> 00:55:31.039 align:start position:0%
discussing it further but uh to
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative faxon's point this issue
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
isn't going away and this committee is
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
the subject matter committee for this
 
00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
issue so we if we knew the conversation
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
going if we knew what it looked like
 
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
we'll zero in on that as they get closer
 
00:55:44.589 --> 00:55:44.599 align:start position:0%
to that would be a good place to start
 
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:48.760 align:start position:0%

00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
assuming the uh ranking Democrat you're
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
okay with a subcommittee that's like
 
00:56:58.829 --> 00:56:58.839 align:start position:0%

just say that that do that too okay
so

00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay you have any opposition do you have
 
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
any you have any campaigning to be doing
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
or never mind okay all right next bill
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
any other bills yes representative
 
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
Burrows um I'd like to pursue HB um 64
 
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
um relative to the resident-owned um I
 
00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:39.880 align:start position:0%
just want the bill resident owned
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing part disputes um
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that there's a legislative
 
00:57:47.549 --> 00:57:47.559 align:start position:0%
fix for this but there seems at minimum
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
to be uh a lack of responsiveness in in
 
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
terms of uh the the agency or agencies
 
00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
that are supposed to be um on top of
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
this so I I would like to explore um
 
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
what if anything could be done okay all
 
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
right who else would like to be on that
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
um I I'd be very interest interested in
 
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
that too and also HB
 
00:58:13.029 --> 00:58:13.039 align:start position:0%
1645 let's just take one at a time well
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying I think that those two
 
00:58:18.029 --> 00:58:18.039 align:start position:0%
go together which one um right above it
 
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
I I
 
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
think you could come up with some sort
 
00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
of a board that would handle both
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
condominium and manufactured home uh
 
00:58:29.069 --> 00:58:29.079 align:start position:0%
disputes a single board that could
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
handle both I think they're they're very
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh very connected so to
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
speak uh yeah they are I would agree
 
00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:41.789 align:start position:0%
speak uh yeah they are I would agree
with

00:58:41.789 --> 00:58:41.799 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
that so if we're going to have a
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
committee have a committee that that
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
does both and maybe can put it into one
 
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:51.640 align:start position:0%
bill okay so we do have someone who
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
please introduce
 
00:59:02.349 --> 00:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
yourself good morning thank you so much
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
for taking my comment I'm Katie McQuade
 
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Community Loan
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
Fund and um rock New Hampshire the resid
 
00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
own communities organization um I'm also
 
00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
a Manchester resident uh the I like what
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative is it melier yes is
 
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
saying about the Condominiums but we
 
00:59:20.109 --> 00:59:20.119 align:start position:0%
also want to make sure that
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
investor-owned manufactured home parks
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
are included in this as well not just
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
resident-owned communities I think that
 
00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
all of the if if this is going to be
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
studied all Park should be studied not
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
for yes you want some share on this one
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
too I thought this was your nutty idea
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.870 --> 00:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Karen Susi I
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
work at she Infinity Capital group and I
 
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire manufactured
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
housing Park Association so that
 
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
includes your manufacturers installers
 
01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
and private park owners I think that
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's a significant difference in what
 
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
you're looking at um so you have
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
resident-owned communities that's the
 
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
residents own them not the private Parks
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
the Condominiums I believe there's also
 
01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
some type of personal investment um on
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
behalf of the cond unit owners and so
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
you're having these disputes between the
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
boards and the residents in both
 
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
cases so I'm not support sure that you
 
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:48.839 align:start position:0%
that okay um well I I would get to just
 
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
to referee this discussion that once you
 
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
create a subcommittee uh that
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is free to talk about
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to talk about
 
01:00:59.950 --> 01:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
certainly I just wanted to make sure the
 
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee was informed as
 
01:01:04.109 --> 01:01:04.119 align:start position:0%
well that that there is a disagreement
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of how broad this these two
 
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
bills should go correct can I ask
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
question everybody got
 
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
that I just want clarification so are
 
01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
you suggesting that these not be
 
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
combined in one study group that
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
there're disparate issues I just want to
 
01:01:23.829 --> 01:01:23.839 align:start position:0%
understand I well I think two things the
 
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
privately owned Parks wouldn't be part
 
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
of this because the residents don't own
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
have any investment in the park
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
themselves they don't own the
 
01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
parks with regard to keeping them
 
01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
separate I the condominium dispute
 
01:01:44.029 --> 01:01:44.039 align:start position:0%
resolution and the uh resident owned I
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
don't have a position
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
okay um can I ask a question yes I don't
 
01:01:54.029 --> 01:01:54.039 align:start position:0%
see why a privately owned manufactured
 
01:01:56.589 --> 01:01:56.599 align:start position:0%
uh uh Park whatever
 
01:01:59.309 --> 01:01:59.319 align:start position:0%
if a resident has a dispute why couldn't
 
01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:03.039 align:start position:0%
that be bought to a a board that covers
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
disputes with with resident owned I I
 
01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
don't understand the I understand the
 
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
difference in the ownership but I don't
 
01:02:13.349 --> 01:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
understand the difference in why if
 
01:02:16.029 --> 01:02:16.039 align:start position:0%
there is a a problem that you can't in
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
all cases go to a resolution
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
board so last I think it was last
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
session um they actually your legisl
 
01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
uh got rid of the state manufactured
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
housing board because there were no
 
01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:33.559 align:start position:0%
complaints that were brought within
 
01:02:33.559 --> 01:02:37.630 align:start position:0%
complaints that were brought within
their

01:02:37.630 --> 01:02:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction but even then they they
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
didn't rule so much on up and down on it
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
they were just ruling in terms of
 
01:02:48.029 --> 01:02:48.039 align:start position:0%
whether the person had a legitimate case
 
01:02:50.589 --> 01:02:50.599 align:start position:0%
about what their complaint was no they
 
01:02:53.789 --> 01:02:53.799 align:start position:0%
had fin out final word on what whether
 
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
there was a punishment or a final
 
01:02:59.549 --> 01:02:59.559 align:start position:0%
decision ni a a premium increase no rent
 
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:01.559 align:start position:0%
was not included in that so the
 
01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
complaints would be related to
 
01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:08.359 align:start position:0%
Services um mostly I'm trying to
 
01:03:09.549 --> 01:03:09.559 align:start position:0%
remember because there hasn't been one
 
01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
in years um like whether or not a person
 
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
could have a sign on their house maybe
 
01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
put up a flag rules it's about rules
 
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
yeah whether or not Park owners were
 
01:03:21.269 --> 01:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
following their own park
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
rules that would it would be what would
 
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
be brought forward rul right
 
01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.950 align:start position:0%
be brought forward rul right
okay

01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you what up all right thank you
 
01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
so I again you know terms of I've been
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
around a long time so at one point in
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
time the issue was always about the
 
01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:45.799 align:start position:0%
privately owned parks and the rates
 
01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
getting increased and the people who who
 
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
are bound to be on that property because
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
they had their unit there that clearly
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
was not movable and that that they were
 
01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
um upset about the premium increases and
 
01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
they felt there was no control uh so we
 
01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
did have legislation to uh have a board
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
to to get approval so that basically was
 
01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:13.240 align:start position:0%
price controls over in increases of the
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
privately owned Parks um and I can tell
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
you I distinctly remember when that
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
occurred that the one thing that was not
 
01:04:24.269 --> 01:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
included would be the community-owned
 
01:04:27.309 --> 01:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
ones you know that uh because that the
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
theory was that they were just like
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
condos and when it comes to condos or it
 
01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
comes to or the these Community own uh
 
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
residential Parks is uh that your your
 
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
rights are with the courts that you have
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
to take them to courts and that was uh
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
so that it would separate the issue um
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
so in terms of having that subcommitte
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
and having the subcommittee to help
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
understand everybody understand that uh
 
01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:57.640 align:start position:0%
I realize it's very frustrating to think
 
01:04:59.309 --> 01:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
that the only way you can get a resolve
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
is you have to go to Superior Court but
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
that is the way we have it New Hampshire
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
um and um so I I I don't have a problem
 
01:05:11.789 --> 01:05:11.799 align:start position:0%
creating a this study committee and of
 
01:05:14.029 --> 01:05:14.039 align:start position:0%
um discussing this problem and I think
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
representative buroughs you should share
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
that's ma
 
01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:33.589 align:start position:0%
that's ma
Le

01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
republican demat dick you come on you're
 
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
you well why do you have what's your
 
01:05:59.950 --> 01:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:02.269 --> 01:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
thank God your mic was off
 
01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:05.100 align:start position:0%
okay can I just can you
 
01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:08.109 align:start position:0%
okay can I just can you
[Laughter]

01:06:08.109 --> 01:06:08.119 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
on uh well first of all what she I in
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
the process of teaching the real estate
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
class which I thankfully no longer do um
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
and we would go to the instructor's
 
01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:27.799 align:start position:0%
Workshop over at the state before the
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
oplc dismantled the real estate
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
commission and we would have a
 
01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:37.799 align:start position:0%
presentation by the manufactured housing
 
01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:41.559 align:start position:0%
board lovely people they had no cases
 
01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
nobody wanted to show up on the board
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
because there was nothing to do when you
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
got there uh
 
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
every 10 years or so there would be a
 
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
complaint so right there what she said
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
is correct Cor in my opinion the the
 
01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
board and what I see this bill doing is
 
01:07:04.109 --> 01:07:04.119 align:start position:0%
recreating a board that we just got rid
 
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
of and as a real estate
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
practitioner we're now going to have
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
to know about this utterly useless
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
board um I believe that in the case
 
01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
of I'm not even hung over uh
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
this was it a tough primary huh yeah no
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't that bad uh
 
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
the all of these all of these entities
 
01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.430 align:start position:0%
the all of these all of these entities
condominium

01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
condominium
 
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
associations owned
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
Parks uh Cooperative
 
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
Parks all
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
have established
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
rules all of which are
 
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
easily more than most 99% of the time
 
01:07:58.109 --> 01:07:58.119 align:start position:0%
are common ly enforced when you buy a
 
01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
when you buy into a condo when you buy
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
when you buy into a a shared
 
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
Park they're required to give you 15
 
01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
days to read the rules if you don't like
 
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
them you don't have to buy it so uh and
 
01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
in the case of
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
owners you know I I do disagree with one
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
thing was said which is that in in in a
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
in a privately owned Park the residents
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a financial commitment
 
01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:25.990 align:start position:0%
don't have a financial commitment
actually

01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
in a privately owned Park the O probably
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
the only asset most of those people have
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
of any significance is the mobile home
 
01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
that is in that Park but they understand
 
01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
what they're getting into and there are
 
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
significant Protections in terms of you
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
can't evict them if you want to sell
 
01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
your Park uh you
 
01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
can't so there's there's lots of
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
protections already in in the law and
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
they're not hard to enforce certainly
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
that the homeowners association rule R
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
are not hard to
 
01:08:59.829 --> 01:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
enforce um many residents wish they were
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
a little harder to enforce so for all of
 
01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
those reasons I think that this is
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
utterly unnecessary legislation I think
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
it makes it harder for the people who
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's trying to protect to function in
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
their homes and their residences I don't
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
I don't see it I see it is solving a
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
problem for no one and creating a
 
01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
problem for almost everyone that's can
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
can I just ask so if there let's just
 
01:09:28.829 --> 01:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
say we have Bad actors in a manufactured
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
housing Park what is the resolution for
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
those people well so who's the who's the
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
bad actor is it the the board we say
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's the board the board the so the
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
elected board yeah and so and we kind of
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
heard that case where there's sort of
 
01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
like this fascist dictator takeover of a
 
01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.590 align:start position:0%
like this fascist dictator takeover of a
homeowners

01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
association my personal take on that is
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh you need you need
 
01:09:57.870 --> 01:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
to you need to if my answer to that is
 
01:10:00.189 --> 01:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
first of all neither the former board
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
nor this board is really in a position
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
to handle that and secondly you have
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
judicial options you need to if if those
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
if the things that we heard testified to
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
here were really that
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
bad they should be going to the county
 
01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
attorney okay and if the County Attorney
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
is unwilling to handle it they should be
 
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
going to elected representatives to get
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
the County Attorney to take it and if
 
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
that didn't work hire a lawyer to take
 
01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
it on a contingency and Sue the beesa
 
01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
all these people that's my answer I
 
01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
realize that's a sophisticated no no I
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
think that's a good answer I just and I
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
I I like the idea about the county
 
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
attorney and the Reps um problem is if
 
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
you have to go the next step to an
 
01:10:38.189 --> 01:10:38.199 align:start position:0%
attorney most of these people don't have
 
01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:39.640 align:start position:0%
the funds to do that I understand that
 
01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
but we're talking about a dozen people
 
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
and a small retainer on what's
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
essentially a easily winnable case okay
 
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't think this is a
 
01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
$50,000 retainer I think this is a you
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
know maybe a $2,000 retainer situation
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
okay thanks for that I appreciate it
 
01:11:00.669 --> 01:11:00.679 align:start position:0%
yeah okay any Republican volunteers de
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%

01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
now really working out well just like
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
marijuana works out really well there in
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
main right yeah yeah yeah it's good it's
 
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
good there's a lawsuit because the town
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
of Ky was I don't know if you be saw of
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
those we get the SE Coast News Don
 
01:13:24.910 --> 01:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
kenary had a lottery that they raised uh
 
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
like $57,000 it was $775 the lottery so
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
you can get a store in K and they raised
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
$57,000 and then the person uh one
 
01:13:39.550 --> 01:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
company was got won the lottery they
 
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
didn't qualify or they they they pulled
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
out or something so the next person on
 
01:13:47.149 --> 01:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
the list it turns out they were too
 
01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
close to a uh
 
01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
school and so they're suing G for not
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
giving them a marijuana license
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
because because they near school and
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
because they near well just they said
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
they you know you took you accepted our
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
775 you or $750 you accepted the money
 
01:14:08.669 --> 01:14:08.679 align:start position:0%
so you know that that was the onus was
 
01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
on them to ensure that that their
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
proposal was legitimate and due
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
diligence not just take the
 
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
money so these study committees uh when
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
when do they have to have a result or
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
when are we supposed to be okay so
 
01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
basically the the sub commes have to
 
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
meet and I usually you know it's in I
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
think these things are due I don't know
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
we have I grabbed a calendar
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
here they do out of commit we have
 
01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:40.470 align:start position:0%
here they do out of commit we have
to

01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:46.430 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.229 --> 01:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
uh on
 
01:14:51.149 --> 01:14:51.159 align:start position:0%
here where
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
was Last
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
oober okay yeah last dat of file yeah so
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
we have to have have to do this by
 
01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.669 align:start position:0%
we have to have have to do this by
October

01:15:00.669 --> 01:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
25th so obviously we don't want to go
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
you know drag this out till then we want
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:21.629 --> 01:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
that okay first of all we I probably
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
would do it the week before in case
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
problem okay so so assume like a
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
Wednesday before so what I guess we can
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.390 align:start position:0%
 
Thursday

01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:37.400 align:start position:0%
Thursday
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
filing uh don't you just have it on your
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
computer and you just print the that's
 
01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
all I did is print my report because
 
01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
it's all on my
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
computer okay
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
I realize for senatorial candidates you
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
guys have a much more elaborate
 
01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
Financial filing than than us lowly
 
01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:08.470 align:start position:0%
Financial filing than than us lowly
house

01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
reps yes okay go ahead another bill yes
 
01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
another bill I just wanted to comment on
 
01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
a bill but not not offer it for study uh
 
01:17:24.669 --> 01:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
1507 that's the uh the sandbox bill I
 
01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
think I think that was Joe Sweeney's
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
bill so I I think that other states are
 
01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
doing that and I think our issue was the
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
Regulator our regul didn't want it so if
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
they bring that bill back I just want to
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
comment that they should figure out and
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's your advice figure out who the
 
01:17:43.229 --> 01:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
regulator the regulate right but other
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
states are doing that Financial sandbox
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
bill so that may come back that's the
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
only reason I'm commenting
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
right what are we doing what happened so
 
01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:55.030 align:start position:0%
right what are we doing what happened so
1507

01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
1507
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
was was a A Whole New Concept you know
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
this is how I I fight dementias is new
 
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
ideas that I've never heard of before in
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
all my 38 years here was the sandbox and
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
that we're going to allow people to do
 
01:18:11.629 --> 01:18:11.639 align:start position:0%
some financial
 
01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
services and the banking and the
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
guidance of the banking Department
 
01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
without the blessing of the
 
01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:20.550 align:start position:0%
without the blessing of the
legislature

01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:18:24.510 --> 01:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
which anatha to me but um I guess I just
 
01:18:26.629 --> 01:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
have to be more creative in my thoughts
 
01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of in in when we did
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
the research for this one yeah just a
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
few months ago there were 11 states or
 
01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
seven states that had tried it all of
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
them stopped all of them done did it the
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
only one who established anything was
 
01:18:44.590 --> 01:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
Hawaii and they finished what they did
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
and no one has started it up again that
 
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
I could find as of about a month ago
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
well maybe things have changed who knows
 
01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
but I'm Sor at any rate we'll hopefully
 
01:18:55.629 --> 01:18:55.639 align:start position:0%
maybe that bill be all saying it may or
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
may not be introduced this next year
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
okay fine that's all I'm saying that's
 
01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
all he's saying just
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
be no buckle your seat belts and be
 
01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
ready for that next
 
01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:12.750 align:start position:0%
ready for that next
year

01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
okay our work is never done here okay uh
 
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
all right so um we created uh three well
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
technically four about three three study
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
committees so we have these two together
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
oh that's right so we have two that's
 
01:19:37.629 --> 01:19:37.639 align:start position:0%
right that's right okay right because we
 
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
have that's right I did that wrong
 
01:19:44.189 --> 01:19:44.199 align:start position:0%
didn't I okay all right so just to wrap
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
up we have a study committee with Ammon
 
01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
Spear and
 
01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
and meu in which um they will be
 
01:19:53.679 --> 01:19:55.189 align:start position:0%
and meu in which um they will be
studying

01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
studying
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
1674 and then we have another study
 
01:20:05.189 --> 01:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
committee that will be doing HB
 
01:20:09.149 --> 01:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
1645 and Senate Bill 64 and that is
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
Burrows melier Thaxton and
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
Hunt okay could you explain the process
 
01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
all right so basically uh the chair is
 
01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
responsible to
 
01:20:23.709 --> 01:20:23.719 align:start position:0%
schedule the meetings um in that you
 
01:20:25.709 --> 01:20:25.719 align:start position:0%
know here it's a fre for all is a
 
01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so you can talk about
 
01:20:29.629 --> 01:20:29.639 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to talk about and our
 
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
work what's our work product and your
 
01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
work product will be that um when we
 
01:20:39.149 --> 01:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
come time to exec the bill uh which uh
 
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
the motion will still be not recommended
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
for future legislation but you will uh
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
write in the blurb oh that's right I'm
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
not supposed to say that the committee
 
01:20:51.149 --> 01:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
report that you will write in the
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
committee report um that you were you
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
have have consensuses and that maybe
 
01:20:59.550 --> 01:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
that there's a possibility that this
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%
legislation go forward with what you
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
would think should be in in that
 
01:21:07.149 --> 01:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
language we're recommending changes for
 
01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
for someone who who would be interested
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
in reintroducing the bill can I yeah my
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
question my question is anybody can
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
introduce an LSR that's similar to the
 
01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
bills that we're talking about right so
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't prevent legislators from it
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
does not prevent reintroducing anything
 
01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:28.360 align:start position:0%
anyways but it's just that it's just to
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
say that this committee has worked on it
 
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
had spent some time drilling down and
 
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
this is this is well that's maybe
 
01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
support but this is where the things
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to say recommend you need
 
01:21:43.709 --> 01:21:43.719 align:start position:0%
to resolve to come forward with that
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
bill that you need to think these issues
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
through and have a have an have a uh you
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
know an answer for these these problems
 
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
because we see these are are uh barriers
 
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
years for for passage it will come back
 
01:21:59.390 --> 01:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
to this committee if we're studying more
 
01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
than likely yeah I mean most the the
 
01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
both both these issues are are that yeah
 
01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:05.639 align:start position:0%
they're not going to really send them to
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
anybody else but us I mean Edna might do
 
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
a a dispute board but they might send
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
that to Edna but if it's if it says
 
01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
condos manufactured housing it's got to
 
01:22:18.910 --> 01:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
come here first and then go to Eda
 
01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
second yes representative gibs and we're
 
01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
looking to have an executive session on
 
01:22:26.669 --> 01:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
October 17th correct thank
 
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
you yeah no 17th we move to the 17th
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
17th that the final meeting and that
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
would be the final meeting question yes
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
the subcommittees will they meet the
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
morning of and then we exec in the

not to show up if you had an
 
01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.669 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh man I I
 
01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:10.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I wouldn't recommend Zoom because
 
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of body language a lot of
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
what people are
 
01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
doing think maybe a preliminary
 
01:24:19.149 --> 01:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
conversation if it's not complex I don't
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
think yeah I yeah yeah I would I might
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to I want to say is I don't
 
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
recommend it okay I'm just saying like
 
01:24:30.510 --> 01:24:30.520 align:start position:0%

01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:33.400 align:start position:0%
have an answer that we going
 
01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.270 align:start position:0%

toys

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
toys
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay she's a chair of the committee so
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
she can do what she you you can call the
 
01:24:44.910 --> 01:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
speaker and ask if you can do it by
 
01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
Zoom I can call the speaker because
 
01:24:49.870 --> 01:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
you're the
 
01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
chair but I would not recommend it I I I
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
think sub committees work best when
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
people were right there looking at each
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
other eyeb eyeball and
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
