00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 align:start position:0%
and then at four o'clock this afternoon
 
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
we'll be having an executive session at

which time we will
 
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
adjudicate on House Bill 418 house bill
 
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 align:start position:0%
before we get started I'll remind
 
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
everyone in attendance here today that
 
00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 align:start position:0%
if you would like to speak on any of
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
these bills I need a pink card filled
 
00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
out and delivered
 
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
to uh the head of the
 
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 align:start position:0%
or to the clerk by as soon as possible
 
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
actually uh as soon as you know you're
 
00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 align:start position:0%
going to speak
 
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
I want to point out that
 
00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
there are quite a few members of the
 
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
committee who are absent today
 
00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 align:start position:0%
like the Cincinnati Bengals and the San
 
00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
Francisco 49ers yesterday it was not a
 
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
good weekend for some members of St e
 
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.830 align:start position:0%
good weekend for some members of St e
yeah

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
representative Christian apparently had
 
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
a tussle with some ice and uh broke her
 
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
ankle so she's not here today
 
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki is in the
 
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
hospital for reasons unknown
 
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
as a result you'll see a few empty spots
 
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
around the table today so I I hope
 
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
you'll keep our missing numbers and your
 
00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 align:start position:0%
thoughts and prayers as we go forward
 
00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.330 align:start position:0%
thoughts and prayers as we go forward
today

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
and with that we can begin our activity
 
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
for today and so I will open the public
 
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 175 relative to
 
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
the state's energy consumption reduction
 
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
goal and I will call to the
 
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
chair the prime sponsor of that bill
 
00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 align:start position:0%
representative Michael Harrington
 
00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
yeah good morning and let's enjoy the
 
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
warmth I guess while we have it because
 
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to get really cold later
 
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
in the week maybe it'll actually be
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable in this building finally
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
um this is a kind of a no-brainer it's
 
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
it just changes the word reduce fossil
 
00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 align:start position:0%
fuel consumption to reduce greenhouse
 
00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 align:start position:0%
gas emissions which is more encompassing
 
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
it covers anything that has greenhouse
 
00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 align:start position:0%
gas implications rather than just fossil
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
fuels it was put up by the department
 
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
requested by the department of energy a
 
00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago I don't remember how
 
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
it got lost on the shuffle but somehow
 
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
it did must have been in the covid
 
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 align:start position:0%
shuffle or whatever but Dave I've spoken
 
00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
with Chris Elms again on it they're
 
00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 align:start position:0%
still they're in support of it uh they
 
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
think it's a it makes more sense to have
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions as the goal to
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
reduce rather than just fossil fuels and
 
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
there's nothing more complicated to it
 
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
than that so if anyone has questions
 
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 align:start position:0%
feel free to ask
 
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900 align:start position:0%
thank you that was uh short and sweet
 
00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:01.259 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas that is thank you Mr chair
 
00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so uh
 
00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:06.539 align:start position:0%
perhaps I missed a follow-up but uh uh
 
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding is I remember because I
 
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
was here then that um in the community
 
00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:16.139 align:start position:0%
report at the time uh the a bill similar
 
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
to this was was introduced uh through
 
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
here and I believe it was passed and it
 
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
hit the house uh and in the committee
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
report in the calendar I stated that
 
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
that that we were going to itl that bill
 
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
because the change had already been made
 
00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:39.419 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to
 
00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
understand if that was true then why are
 
00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:46.259 align:start position:0%
we resubmitting the bill now were we
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
Incorrect and saying the the change had
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
been made because we were told at the
 
00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:52.139 align:start position:0%
time that the change by the Des people
 
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
that the change had been made so I'm
 
00:07:57.529 --> 00:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
confused I well I I will join you in
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
your confusion all I can tell you is
 
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
when you look up the law it says fossil
 
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
fuel as it's shown on the bill and it
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't changed to greenhouse gas
 
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
emissions and so I didn't even know who
 
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
brought it to my attention I think it
 
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
was someone from Des I looked at it and
 
00:08:14.089 --> 00:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
said okay I'll put it back in and I just
 
00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:16.139 align:start position:0%
I say it was I checked with Chris Elms
 
00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
over the weekend he was supposed to have
 
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
the Griff here today but he's not in for
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
whatever reason maybe he's hopefully
 
00:08:22.249 --> 00:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
he's not in the hospital like all these
 
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
other people
 
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
um uh but they were going to say they
 
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
support the change because it's just
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.649 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:32.659 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think uh thank you Mr chairman
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for
 
00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill I I just wanted to
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
uh to follow up on representative
 
00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:46.910 align:start position:0%
uh to follow up on representative
um

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas's um question
 
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.670 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas's um question
um

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
that was in I think the 2021 session in
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
the 2020 session the same bill was
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
introduced and it was the same situation
 
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:01.860 align:start position:0%
where it was determined that the that
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
the bill was not needed so I guess I'm I
 
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:06.300 align:start position:0%
joined with representative Thomas and
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand why why why we
 
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:11.220 align:start position:0%
need to do this well let me do this so
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
we don't waste a lot of time I will
 
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:15.899 align:start position:0%
research this and see if it's still
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
needed the Des the department of energy
 
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
people told me they wanted it I'll get
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
back with them I'll recheck the law and
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'll send out something to the committee
 
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
so we don't have to waste any more time
 
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
on deciding whether it's needed or not
 
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
if it's not needed I'll withdraw the
 
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.110 align:start position:0%
if it's not needed I'll withdraw the
bill

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
well we do have a
 
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Fitzgerald from Des who has offered
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill he may be able
 
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
to clarify this situation for us so if
 
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
there are no further questions for
 
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:49.740 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I'll I'd like
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
to call on um well first I'd remind
 
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington to fill out a
 
00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:56.519 align:start position:0%
pin card and then I will all I have to
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
do as a sponsor yes even I sponsor you
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
have to submit a pink card for the
 
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
official record
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
um that representative Bernardi is our
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
well it's going to be easy because now I
 
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
know how much time I spend to you so I
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
can fill that out accurately for once
 
00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:11.810 align:start position:0%
can fill that out accurately for once
okay

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
and Mike Fitz go well if you can explain
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
it feel free and then I will call on
 
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
e good morning Mr chairman
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
Michael Fitzgerald I'm the assistant
 
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
director of the air Resources Division
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Environmental
 
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.750 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Environmental
Services

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:40.740 align:start position:0%
prior to the creation of the Department
 
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:43.640 align:start position:0%
of Energy Des
 
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
was significantly involved in energy
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
tracking for state and we were
 
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
significantly involved in the uh setting
 
00:10:59.410 --> 00:10:59.420 align:start position:0%
these goals in the executive order that
 
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.030 align:start position:0%
these goals in the executive order that
followed

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
followed
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
but intimately involved in the
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
legislation that that established these
 
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
goals back in 2010 one of the reasons
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
that the term fossil fuel use was
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
adopted was because it was somewhat more
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
amenable to State many state agencies
 
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
who greenhouse gases tracking and so on
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
didn't make a lot of uh didn't uh you
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
know resonate and so we we just decided
 
00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:30.230 align:start position:0%
know resonate and so we we just decided
um

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:32.449 --> 00:11:32.459 align:start position:0%
the interest here was in energy
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
management in reducing energy costs and
 
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
and reducing energy usage in state
 
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
government and so uh in 2010 this goal
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
was in Wisconsin statute and then
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
re-uh affirmed uh by by a later
 
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
Governor's executive order
 
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:49.910 align:start position:0%
Governor's executive order
um

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
so Des uh and the since the Inception of
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
this goal the state has saved via report
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
Services who could not be here today was
 
00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:07.019 align:start position:0%
ranta Mackey from the from Das would be
 
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
happy to respond to questions or provide
 
00:12:13.009 --> 00:12:13.019 align:start position:0%
additional information but based on
 
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
their report of State Energy savings
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
with that they track
 
00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:22.019 align:start position:0%
um up through last year the state has
 
00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:25.019 align:start position:0%
received approximately 50 million
 
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
dollars in Energy savings as a result of
 
00:12:32.449 --> 00:12:32.459 align:start position:0%
of energy management energy reductions
 
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
that have been implemented since this
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
executive order
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh our concern with this bill is that uh
 
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
if you change to greenhouse gas
 
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.389 align:start position:0%
if you change to greenhouse gas
emissions

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
the goal will have already been met
 
00:12:51.889 --> 00:12:51.899 align:start position:0%
um and that the goal of 25 percent
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
um and that's partially due to the fact
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
that the state changed over from
 
00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:01.139 align:start position:0%
um uh very different forms of energy
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
from significant use of oil to natural
 
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
natural gas in several places also wood
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
energy has been has been used and all of
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
that has resulted in significant
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emission reductions
 
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's not
 
00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
a direct correlation between uh
 
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel usage and greenhouse gas
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
emission reductions
 
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:30.380 align:start position:0%
the Chris skogland
 
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
who is here today and uh is with clean
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
energy New Hampshire was part of my
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
staff up until last year and he worked
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
intimately on this so he could I believe
 
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
he intends on testifying he can provide
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
you with some uh some greater detail and
 
00:13:48.769 --> 00:13:48.779 align:start position:0%
information as to as to the uh to the
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
numbers but
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
um I I think that our belief is that if
 
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
this were to change we're not we don't
 
00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
object to the change to greenhouse gas
 
00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
emissions but the goal would need to be
 
00:14:01.129 --> 00:14:01.139 align:start position:0%
adjusted to account for those greenhouse
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
gas emission reductions that have
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
already occurred so in in other words
 
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
um the I believe the number is somewhere
 
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
in the 30 to 40 percent range that we've
 
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
already achieved so the 25 percent
 
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
that's in here now we believe was should
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
be adjusted to account for greenhouse
 
00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
gases rather than fossil fuels we don't
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
have any concern with the change of the
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
terminology just the fact that if that's
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
done the goal will have already been
 
00:14:35.449 --> 00:14:35.459 align:start position:0%
achieved so it will be of no value going
 
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
forward in incenting energy state
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
agencies to continue to reduce energy
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
use and to save costs for State of New
 
00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the citizens of the State
 
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:46.940 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
so with that uh
 
00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:53.579 align:start position:0%
it was my testimony and I'm happy to try
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
to address questions again Mr skoglund
 
00:14:57.769 --> 00:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
probably has more intimate knowledge and
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
detail than myself but we and again Das
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
would be available to try to answer
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
questions also
 
00:15:08.569 --> 00:15:08.579 align:start position:0%
thank you for for your testimony
 
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh on
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the the question at hand
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
is not the merits of this bill right now
 
00:15:25.129 --> 00:15:25.139 align:start position:0%
it's the question is do are are you
 
00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:29.339 align:start position:0%
aware If the previous Bill uh that was
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
approved by the house a couple of years
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
ago did that ever get signed by the
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
governor and if so why it did not wind
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
up in the rsas because I don't feel we
 
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:43.740 align:start position:0%
can move forward on this bill until we
 
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
I I do not believe that occurred again
 
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
Mr skoglund might be able to address
 
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more I do know that
 
00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:53.339 align:start position:0%
this bill was brought forward last year
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
as representative Harrington mentioned
 
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
he and I discussed it briefly
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
um and he had he indicated as he had
 
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
before that had been a request of staff
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.269 align:start position:0%
from the
um

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
precursor to the Department of energy
 
00:16:09.889 --> 00:16:09.899 align:start position:0%
the office of strategic initiatives and
 
00:16:09.899 --> 00:16:11.030 align:start position:0%
the office of strategic initiatives and
uh

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:14.569 --> 00:16:14.579 align:start position:0%
um we I raised the same same issues with
 
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
him at that time and then he
 
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
subsequently withdrew it last year but I
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
could not speak to the prior year but I
 
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
don't I believe the statute is still the
 
00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:25.139 align:start position:0%
same I don't believe the statute has
 
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
been changed I'm not sure of the history
 
00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
of of the bill but we could I could
 
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
certainly look that up and and get back
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
to you on it
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
thank you please do
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
representative Summers asked a question
 
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just a quick
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
question for clarification you had
 
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
stated there that greenhouse gases were
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
lowered due to uh the use of natural gas
 
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
and natural gas is a fossil fuel correct
 
00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.509 align:start position:0%
and natural gas is a fossil fuel correct
absolutely

00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
00:16:58.009 --> 00:16:58.019 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
coming back to the committee
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
um I I believe in the report that you
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
were referencing where you mentioned the
 
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
50 million dollar reduction it stated
 
00:17:09.049 --> 00:17:09.059 align:start position:0%
that the reduction in fossil fuels since
 
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
2005 has been about 17 percent
 
00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:15.419 align:start position:0%
um and you also mentioned that the
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
reduction in greenhouse gases is about
 
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
30 to 40. so does that suggest that
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
there is like a two to one relationship
 
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
between the percentage reduction in in
 
00:17:26.689 --> 00:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions and the
 
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
percentage reduction of fossil fuels
 
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
well I wouldn't make that in general but
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
certainly in some specific fuels for
 
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
instance natural gas and oil and it's
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
basically it has to do with the btu
 
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
content of the uh of the fuel so that
 
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:47.780 align:start position:0%
you may you you burn less natural gas
 
00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:51.539 align:start position:0%
to get the same amount of energy uh so
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
and and but different fuels have
 
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
different values so I wouldn't say
 
00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
that's it's specifically two to one but
 
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
um basically uh as a result of the fuel
 
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
switching that has been done now that
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
ratio would have would certainly appear
 
00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
fairly accurate follow-up
 
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
follow-up so if that's the case then if
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
we wanted to switch over to the gas
 
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions standard the
 
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
standard should be something closer to
 
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
40 or 50 50 something I mean that would
 
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
need to be discussed and certainly our
 
00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:33.419 align:start position:0%
our department and uh Das and doe can
 
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
you know engage we'd be willing to
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
engage on that
 
00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:40.340 align:start position:0%
um but uh
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
you know and obviously the governor's
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
office would need to be involved in
 
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.610 align:start position:0%
office would need to be involved in
making

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
you know deciding what our agencies
 
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
would recommend as a uh an appropriate
 
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.029 align:start position:0%
would recommend as a uh an appropriate
goal

00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
goal
 
00:18:58.850 --> 00:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams has a question
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair Bose and thank you Mr
 
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald for your testimony
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
I I just want to understand if we were
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
to amend this bill because it sounds
 
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
like there's some good stuff in it
 
00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.630 align:start position:0%
like there's some good stuff in it
um

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:18.299 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a 2005 Baseline which
 
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:24.299 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to update the
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
Baseline if we were to amend this bill
 
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
do we have another year that we use as a
 
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
baseline say 2015 or is there a number
 
00:19:32.029 --> 00:19:32.039 align:start position:0%
that the department typically looks to
 
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
it's been a while
 
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.330 align:start position:0%
it's been a while
yeah

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
um as as I mentioned I think this goal
 
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
was established in 2010 and so the 22
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
2005 Baseline but we could certainly
 
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
um that that's certainly something that
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
the three agencies would want to look at
 
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
and and make a determination as to what
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
an appropriate Baseline would would be
 
00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has a question
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm not sure how to word this
 
00:20:01.799 --> 00:20:02.810 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm not sure how to word this
correctly

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.250 align:start position:0%
correctly
um

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:06.409 --> 00:20:06.419 align:start position:0%
after all is said and done with all the
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
mandates and not allowing these reliable
 
00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
sources of fuel what is the percentage
 
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
um for in the air quality
 
00:20:18.289 --> 00:20:18.299 align:start position:0%
like it's point zero zero something
 
00:20:18.299 --> 00:20:21.230 align:start position:0%
like it's point zero zero something
percent

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I what what do you mean
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
when you say percentage in air quality
 
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
what do you mean well I've seen it up on
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
a screen I was at a conference and they
 
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
were talking about New Hampshire
 
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
um that it was up on the screen they
 
00:20:39.529 --> 00:20:39.539 align:start position:0%
were talking about New Hampshire and
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
with all the mandates and the greenhouse
 
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
gas emission emissions and um doing away
 
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
with fossil fuels and the the air
 
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:49.940 align:start position:0%
quality was better by
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
0.00 something percent is that which you
 
00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.710 align:start position:0%
0.00 something percent is that which you
have

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
air quality is measured and by a number
 
00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
of parameters
 
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
um uh if if you're referring to
 
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases that would be a carbon
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
dioxide which is measured in on the
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
order of parts per million in the
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
atmosphere and it's a global pollutant
 
00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
but there's also air quality is measured
 
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
by particulate matter which that's
 
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
particulate matter is significantly
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
um connected to to fossil fuel use
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
burning combustion of fossil fuels
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
results in significant amounts of
 
00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
particulate matter
 
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
um and so I I would need to certainly
 
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
get back to you in terms of any any of
 
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
those specific parameters I can't think
 
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
think certainly of an overall air
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
quality number that would be
 
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
that that might comport with what you're
 
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
referencing I I'd need to see what
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.649 --> 00:21:59.659 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
more of a point of order uh Mr chair uh
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
this bill deals with changing of
 
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
language from fossil fuel to greenhouse
 
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.630 align:start position:0%
language from fossil fuel to greenhouse
gas

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
gas
 
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
it may or may not be relevant it seems
 
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
like we've diverted to amending the bill
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
to talk about changing goals I don't
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
think that's the subject of the bill
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
that's not an amendment that's on the
 
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
floor I think we need to get answer the
 
00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:30.659 align:start position:0%
question of is this necessary or not and
 
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
maybe our assistant can help us with
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not it has actually been
 
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Noel has a
 
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.029 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Noel has a
question

00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I'm a little
 
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
confused about the units of measure for
 
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel consumption versus
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions are those on a
 
00:23:00.409 --> 00:23:00.419 align:start position:0%
weight basis or are those they're on a
 
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.299 align:start position:0%
uh actually in the statute this is on a
 
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
per square foot of uh you know this is
 
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
referencing state buildings since you
 
00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
know this this building included so it's
 
00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
energy energy use
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure whether the numbers in
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
BTUs or in pounds or or whatever but
 
00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
it's but it's in on a per square foot
 
00:23:21.179 --> 00:23:22.610 align:start position:0%
it's but it's in on a per square foot
basis

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:27.059 align:start position:0%
um uh so it's it's not
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
um you know overall it's it's energy use
 
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.230 align:start position:0%
um you know overall it's it's energy use
intensity

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chair
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
so effectively the the two
 
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
resources would be measured in the same
 
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.390 align:start position:0%
resources would be measured in the same
way

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
following the standard if I understand
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
you correctly yes it would be measured
 
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
on a per square foot usage and that's
 
00:23:54.289 --> 00:23:54.299 align:start position:0%
how the department of administrative
 
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
Services uh tracks energy usage in the
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
state now uh towards achieving the goal
 
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
that's currently in statute
 
00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:12.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.289 --> 00:24:15.299 align:start position:0%
we clearly understand that there's not
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
an amendment before the here I my point
 
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
was simply that the goal is not is not
 
00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:24.539 align:start position:0%
consistent with the unit change so we
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
would want we as an agency we we think
 
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
that's something that should be
 
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.350 align:start position:0%
that's something that should be
considered

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
so even though there is not an amendment
 
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:34.740 align:start position:0%
before us you would like to see one that
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's our
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
okay great feeling message received
 
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh representative Thomas has decided he
 
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
has another question uh actually uh this
 
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
is uh another uh point of order for the
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
chair uh could you please advise uh
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
future speakers that we're talking about
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
the subject of this bill at hand
 
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
uh and please uh if they could present
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
their discussions as to this particular
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
Bill matter
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
will do okay seeing no further questions
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
of Mr Fitzgerald I'd like to thank you
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
for being here this morning and I'd like
 
00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:15.980 align:start position:0%
to call next to the stand Chris skogland
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
representing clean energy New Hampshire
 
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
formerly of the Department of
 
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.850 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:25:33.659 --> 00:25:34.850 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
committee

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:36.779 align:start position:0%
as has been mentioned I'm Chris goglin
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
I'm the director of energy transition
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
with clean energy New Hampshire
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
formerly I was with the New Hampshire
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services for
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
14 years 10 years of which was spent
 
00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
maintaining a database on behalf of the
 
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services
 
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
that dealt with this issue just a little
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
bit of History to answer some of the
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
questions I've heard today this change
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
was first proposed in House Bill 1261
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
during in 2020 which due to the pandemic
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
I believe was set aside but was not
 
00:26:09.289 --> 00:26:09.299 align:start position:0%
enrolled in any of the Omnibus bills so
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
that bill did not ultimately pass in
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
2021 in HB 399 it was introduced again
 
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
but I believe it was then withdrawn some
 
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
of the challenge has been uh
 
00:26:24.289 --> 00:26:24.299 align:start position:0%
over the past several years with the
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
creation of the change of staff at the
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
office then office of strategic
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
initiatives and the creation of the
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
Department of energy kind of the history
 
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
of the bills as they've moved through
 
00:26:36.529 --> 00:26:36.539 align:start position:0%
has been lost and so we've discussed
 
00:26:36.539 --> 00:26:37.610 align:start position:0%
has been lost and so we've discussed
this

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
um a few times and I think
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
that may be where some of the confusion
 
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
stands in terms of its existence and
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
need but I would Echo having contributed
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
to some of the analysis for the last two
 
00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
rounds Mr Fitzgerald's point that we
 
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
have met the goal
 
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:55.549 align:start position:0%
have met the goal
um

00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:57.769 --> 00:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
and that there may need to be a point of
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
reconsidering whether to change the
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
Baseline change the end Year from 2025
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
to 2020 I mean 2030
 
00:27:05.159 --> 00:27:05.750 align:start position:0%
to 2020 I mean 2030
um

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
but what I would note is that the
 
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
existing goal has been instrumental in
 
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
driving New Hampshire's the state of New
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's energy cost savings we've
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
avoided almost 48 million dollars as of
 
00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
the end of fiscal year 2021 I believe uh
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
the new energy manager with the state is
 
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
calculating and is due to release a
 
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
report for fiscal year 2022 shortly
 
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
um but one of the reasons why we chose
 
00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:36.539 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels around the time frame of
 
00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:39.620 align:start position:0%
2010 was we had just come out of the
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
2008-2009 energy price spikes and I was
 
00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
at that time it was felt that fossil
 
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
fuels were an excellent proxy for uh
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
fuels that uh were influenced by a
 
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
global market but also did impact a
 
00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
broad range of environmental
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
considerations so the 48 million dollars
 
00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:01.549 align:start position:0%
considerations so the 48 million dollars
um

00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:01.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
does reflect price changes over time but
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
it also and the insulation we've
 
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.830 align:start position:0%
it also and the insulation we've
provided

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
and I'll pause there if there are any
 
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
other questions I am happy to answer
 
00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
them oh I will no uh the previous the
 
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
target is measured on a kbtu per square
 
00:28:21.169 --> 00:28:21.179 align:start position:0%
foot basis when we're looking at energy
 
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:23.700 align:start position:0%
and the fossil fuels would most likely
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
be in a pounds per square foot basis
 
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
or tons per square foot basis one of the
 
00:28:30.769 --> 00:28:30.779 align:start position:0%
reasons why a per square foot basis was
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
chosen though is to reflect the fact
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
that the state might
 
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
open new facilities and that we didn't
 
00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
want to ding the state by if the square
 
00:28:42.529 --> 00:28:42.539 align:start position:0%
footage expands we didn't want to have
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
an absolute energy reduction goal or an
 
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
absolute fossil fuel reduction goal that
 
00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:48.299 align:start position:0%
we would just be looking at each
 
00:28:48.299 --> 00:28:50.090 align:start position:0%
we would just be looking at each
building

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
on a building by building basis so it
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
was to reflect that the state's building
 
00:28:57.289 --> 00:28:57.299 align:start position:0%
square footage might go up or down
 
00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:01.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:03.649 --> 00:29:03.659 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'll I'll ask you
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
the same question and hopefully I hope I
 
00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
can get either a two or three letter
 
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
answer yes or no
 
00:29:21.649 --> 00:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
since this bill in 2021 did hit the
 
00:29:24.889 --> 00:29:24.899 align:start position:0%
calendar uh with my recommendation that
 
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
I'd be itl'd I'm assuming it went before
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
the house for a vote which maybe maybe
 
00:29:33.409 --> 00:29:33.419 align:start position:0%
what was itl
 
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
did HB 399
 
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
get voted on and was the result itl at
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
the time or was it OTP yeah that's the
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
trying to be brief it's my recollection
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
and it's the reflection of the docket
 
00:29:59.450 --> 00:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
that it was and in fact uh italt
 
00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:03.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.049 --> 00:30:06.059 align:start position:0%
representative uh McWilliams has a
 
00:30:06.059 --> 00:30:07.669 align:start position:0%
representative uh McWilliams has a
question

00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Bose and thank you Mr
 
00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
skobin for your testimony
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
I just want to understand here the the
 
00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
piece you talked about with increasing
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
square footage for State offices
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
um can you explain to me how that's
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
different between fossil fuel
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
if we decide to put in a new facility
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
that say no 100 000 square feet
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
the the consideration would not change
 
00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
in that the language of the bill as
 
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
written keeps the green keeps the
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
intensity language still there so it's
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas intensity the way that
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
when I was part of the state and now
 
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
would interpret that is it's a
 
00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:54.299 align:start position:0%
pounds or tons of CO2 or other
 
00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases that are emitted per
 
00:30:58.970 --> 00:30:58.980 align:start position:0%
square foot of building space so if we
 
00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:01.940 align:start position:0%
added a new building
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
the goal would be to achieve that same
 
00:31:06.769 --> 00:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
reduction below whatever Baseline you're
 
00:31:09.769 --> 00:31:09.779 align:start position:0%
set in this case it's 2005. and the 2005
 
00:31:11.889 --> 00:31:11.899 align:start position:0%
year was set because that was a
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
executive order that had been issued
 
00:31:15.409 --> 00:31:15.419 align:start position:0%
that established that Baseline back in
 
00:31:15.419 --> 00:31:17.510 align:start position:0%
that established that Baseline back in
2005.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
2005.
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:21.649 --> 00:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you thank you for
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
um isn't there a existing order
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
executive order on file currently that
 
00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
raised the uh Target from 25 percent by
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
2025 to 40 percent and if so wouldn't
 
00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
that suggest that if we switched over to
 
00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:42.539 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases that
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
we would want to have a number that's a
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
percentage that's significantly higher
 
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
than so they're talking about oh sorry
 
00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh and thank you for the question and
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
also thank you to others for your
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
questions uh there was an executive
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
order issued in 2016 executive order
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
2000 or 2016-03 and I believe that that
 
00:32:02.399 --> 00:32:03.889 align:start position:0%
2000 or 2016-03 and I believe that that
uh

00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
increase the goal
 
00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
and in my mind I want to say it went to
 
00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
50 but I also think that the years that
 
00:32:12.529 --> 00:32:12.539 align:start position:0%
it went out also was extended and that
 
00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
was to reflect that we had seen a great
 
00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:17.220 align:start position:0%
deal of uh success
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up to just for the record I'm
 
00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
looking at at the at the report that
 
00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
references this and it's a states that
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
the executive order uh raised the goal
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
up to 40 by 2025 and 50 by 2030.
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
that is my recollection thank you thank
 
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:43.490 align:start position:0%
that is my recollection thank you thank
you

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:43.500 align:start position:0%

preliminary discussion on a bill is
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate if the members are not ready
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
to vote or then there's a need for
 
00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:57.180 align:start position:0%

00:37:08.569 --> 00:37:08.579 align:start position:0%
so the voting process first is putting
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
committee if there's any objection to
 
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
placing a bill on the consent calendar
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
assuming there seems to be unanimity or
 
00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
only one or two uh uh contrary votes if
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
there is no objection the bill may be
 
00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
placed on the consent calendar
 
00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
if there's any bills with more than two
 
00:39:29.329 --> 00:39:29.339 align:start position:0%
navotes the custom is to place it on the
 
00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
regular calendar
 
00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:35.099 align:start position:0%
no bills with fiscal impact or an or any
 
00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
appropriation may be placed on the
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:44.579 align:start position:0%
reconsideration a motion for
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
reconsideration is appropriate and does
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
not require a member making the motion
 
00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
to have voted on the prevailing side
 
00:39:59.770 --> 00:39:59.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
and reconsideration motion is only in
 
00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:05.099 align:start position:0%
order when the committee ha still has
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
possession of the bill so if the bill
 
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:09.260 align:start position:0%
has left the committee no further
 
00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
reconsiderations is available
 
00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:14.510 align:start position:0%
reconsiderations is available
foreign

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that excellent
 
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
summary representative Bernardi are
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
there any questions representative munz
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
appears to have a question yes thanks Mr
 
00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.349 align:start position:0%
appears to have a question yes thanks Mr
chair

00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:40:24.359 --> 00:40:25.630 align:start position:0%
chair
um

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
subcommittees uh can members request
 
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
that there be a subcommittee how does
 
00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
yes a member can request it although the
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
chair makes the final decision about
 
00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
whether to form a subcommittee but it
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
can be requested follow-up and when
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
would be the appropriate time to ask for
 
00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
that would that be
 
00:40:46.859 --> 00:40:47.569 align:start position:0%
that would that be
um

00:40:47.569 --> 00:40:47.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
after the motion has been made in the
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
executive committee during the hearing
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
no the motion to form a subcommittee
 
00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
should happen during the course of the
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
public hearing on a bill
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
executive session is way too late we
 
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
can't form a subcommittee if you're
 
00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
already an executive session because
 
00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:08.660 align:start position:0%
you're going to vote on them on the bill
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
so you need to form a subcommittee early
 
00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
in the process Sometimes some committees
 
00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
even form subcommittees before they hear
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
a bill in public hearing for example the
 
00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee has four standing
 
00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.510 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee has four standing
subcommittees

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittees
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
and they assign every bill that gets
 
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
assigned to the committee to a
 
00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.690 align:start position:0%
assigned to the committee to a
subcommittee

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:34.740 align:start position:0%
and those subcommittees take charge of
 
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
the public hearing process on the bill
 
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
doing research on the bill and they
 
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
ultimately make a recommendation on the
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
final bill to the full committee
 
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
That's the Way Commerce organizes
 
00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.730 align:start position:0%
That's the Way Commerce organizes
themselves

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
we haven't done that in this committee
 
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
we've talked about it but have decided
 
00:41:56.569 --> 00:41:56.579 align:start position:0%
that the subject matter of our committee
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
is such that it would be hard to to come
 
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
up with three or four standing
 
00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.530 align:start position:0%
up with three or four standing
committees

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.130 align:start position:0%
committees
um

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
to which to refer bills so what we do
 
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
instead is we decide as we go through
 
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
the public hearing process does this
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
look like a bill that needs a
 
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and if it is then we form
 
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
one for example last year we had a bill
 
00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.050 align:start position:0%
one for example last year we had a bill
on

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:23.510 align:start position:0%
on
5G

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
5G
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh matters and whether
 
00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:27.950 align:start position:0%
uh matters and whether
um

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
there was a public health
 
00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:30.770 align:start position:0%
there was a public health
effect

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
from the output of of these radio
 
00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
transmitters and it was a complicated
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
subject in fact there had been a study
 
00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.310 align:start position:0%
subject in fact there had been a study
Commission

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
the previous year that had issued a
 
00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
thousand page report on this subject so
 
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
we did form a study committee to
 
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
ascertain just how to proceed with that
 
00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:53.150 align:start position:0%
ascertain just how to proceed with that
bill

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
and we probably will will do something
 
00:42:58.609 --> 00:42:58.619 align:start position:0%
similar this year if we have time
 
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
is the other critical factor in forming
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee
 
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
uh a subcommittee requires a small group
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
a subset of this committee to get
 
00:43:10.609 --> 00:43:10.619 align:start position:0%
together on a separate day and time to
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
discuss what to do with the bill so
 
00:43:17.569 --> 00:43:17.579 align:start position:0%
if our timelines are really tight it
 
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
might be difficult to schedule a
 
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee session for a particular
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
bill but we can try and we'll we'll
 
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
discuss that amongst ourselves as the
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
need arises
 
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative Corman has
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi for explaining
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
to us how the process works uh
 
00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi said that the
 
00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
chair solicits a motion can emotion be
 
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:49.380 align:start position:0%
made uh without the chair soliciting
 
00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:50.809 align:start position:0%
made uh without the chair soliciting
no

00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
yeah representative and I've apologized
 
00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:57.829 align:start position:0%
yeah representative and I've apologized
Jack

00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
Jack
 
00:43:57.839 --> 00:43:59.750 align:start position:0%
Jack
Jack

00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
Jack
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
representative Jack has a question thank
 
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I wonder if
 
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi would touch on
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
the process after the vote is taken how
 
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:08.220 align:start position:0%
do we get the committee report who
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
writes it how long do you have how do we
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
the the chairman uh normally assigns or
 
00:44:23.569 --> 00:44:23.579 align:start position:0%
asks who is going to write the minority
 
00:44:26.569 --> 00:44:26.579 align:start position:0%
and majority report
 
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
um if the amendment is proposed by or I
 
00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
mean the bills proposed by someone in
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
the in the committee they're gonna
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
they're gonna end up writing that at
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
least one of those reports and I'll let
 
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
the chairman add to that yeah so
 
00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
typically the person who makes the
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
motion that prevails writes that report
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
it could either be a majority report or
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
it could be a Minority Report or it
 
00:44:53.569 --> 00:44:53.579 align:start position:0%
could be a report for the whole
 
00:44:53.579 --> 00:44:54.770 align:start position:0%
could be a report for the whole
committee

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:44:59.230 --> 00:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
if the vote on the bill doesn't
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily require a Minority Report
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
then the report reflects the will of the
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
entire committee
 
00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
so for example if we vote on a bill and
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's 20 to nothing in favor of the bill
 
00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
we don't need a Minority Report
 
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee has
 
00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:17.870 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee has
decided

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
decided
 
00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.130 align:start position:0%
decided
what

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
the fate of the bill is and that becomes
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
the committee report
 
00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
because majority and minority members
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
have contributed to that decision does
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
that answer your question
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I actually knew that I just this
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
was for the benefit of anyone who's new
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
to this process oh okay great
 
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas would like to add
 
00:45:46.609 --> 00:45:46.619 align:start position:0%
to that yes thank you and uh and I'm
 
00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
sure and the chair would probably
 
00:45:50.329 --> 00:45:50.339 align:start position:0%
mentioned this later on any committee
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
report that is written majority or
 
00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.170 align:start position:0%
report that is written majority or
minority

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
minority
 
00:45:59.210 --> 00:45:59.220 align:start position:0%
must reflect accurately uh any points
 
00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
that were brought out during the public
 
00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:03.660 align:start position:0%
hearing or the executive session
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
um we've been advised the past there
 
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
have been some reports not from this
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
group because we have a good group here
 
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
but there are other committees that
 
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes have reports that actually are
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
completely different than what was
 
00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
discussed during public hearing and so
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's up to the chair to decide to accept
 
00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
or ask for amendments or changes to any
 
00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:26.300 align:start position:0%
committee report
 
00:46:28.609 --> 00:46:28.619 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Thomas to
 
00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
expand on that a little bit all
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
committee reports come to me as chairman
 
00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
and I evaluate those committee reports
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
and if they're not satisfactory in some
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
way I will ask the member who wrote the
 
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
report to make some changes if if
 
00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.210 align:start position:0%
report to make some changes if if
necessary

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:43.220 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
once I approve the report then it will
 
00:46:47.809 --> 00:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
go into the calendar
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has a question
 
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
yeah can the clerk's office
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
rewrite or edit
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
um we don't call them blurbs anymore my
 
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
majority reports are minority reports
 
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:04.140 align:start position:0%
the clerk and the speaker review all
 
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
minority and majority reports and they
 
00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
can request changes from the committee
 
00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:12.839 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to make those
 
00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
changes on their own
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
but they can request that we make them
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
and they can refuse essentially to
 
00:47:20.809 --> 00:47:20.819 align:start position:0%
accept the report until those changes
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
McWilliams has one
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Bose what is the
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
deadline for submitting to you to review
 
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
tough question
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
the ideal is to have a committee report
 
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
ready to go when you make a motion in
 
00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:49.980 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:53.099 align:start position:0%
so that you can hand it to me before the
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
Executive before we leave that that day
 
00:47:59.530 --> 00:47:59.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:01.309 align:start position:0%
 
frequently

00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's not possible to do that because the
 
00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
motion made in committee ends up being a
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
little different than what
 
00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
one might have anticipated so I
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
typically give people until noon the
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
next day to complete and and forward to
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative partial has a question
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair most
 
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
um could you walk me through a little
 
00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
bit of the process of amending a bill
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
during executive committee I'm forcing
 
00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:34.859 align:start position:0%
the situation where Amendment may have
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
an impact on whether or not the bill
 
00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
needs a subcommittee
 
00:48:44.089 --> 00:48:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay I'll try to answer that
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
so the process during executive
 
00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.170 align:start position:0%
so the process during executive
committee

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
when you know you want to make an
 
00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
amendment to a bill would be like this
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
you let me know ahead of time so that I
 
00:49:02.089 --> 00:49:02.099 align:start position:0%
can recognize you for emotion and your
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
emotion will be
 
00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I move
 
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with Amendment and offer
 
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
amendment number XXX
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
that would be the motion
 
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:18.839 align:start position:0%
we would then take up the amendment and
 
00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
if we pass the amendment then
 
00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:25.250 align:start position:0%
if we pass the amendment then
the

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
the motion of ought to pass as amended
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
actually I think I did that slightly
 
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
wrong what what the motion would be
 
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:40.740 align:start position:0%
I move ought to pass and offer Amendment
 
00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:43.190 align:start position:0%
I move ought to pass and offer Amendment
xxxx

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
xxxx
 
00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
and then if the amendment passes then
 
00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
the motion is ought to pass as amended
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
now in the case of multiple amendments
 
00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
we've been advised that we have to
 
00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:58.450 align:start position:0%
we've been advised that we have to
somehow

00:49:58.450 --> 00:49:58.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:01.140 align:start position:0%
consolidate those amendments and that
 
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
process could be a little bit messy
 
00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
and time consuming so we'll have to be
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
very very careful about how we go about
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
amend a bill more than once in committee
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
you can run up against the problem where
 
00:50:20.089 --> 00:50:20.099 align:start position:0%
one Amendment might supersede another
 
00:50:23.809 --> 00:50:23.819 align:start position:0%
and erase some of the
 
00:50:25.609 --> 00:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
things you were trying to do in your
 
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
first amendment so it it can be
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
complicated and and you have to approach
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
that subject with care
 
00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:35.339 align:start position:0%
representative merner has a comment yes
 
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr getting back to talking
 
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
about subcommittees on the first year I
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
remember here I think three or four
 
00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:45.319 align:start position:0%
terms ago we retained almost 11 bills
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
and that's where we had a lot of
 
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
subcommittees because we saw bills that
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
needed a little more work so that
 
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
alleviates the deadline especially on
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
the first year legislation
 
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:56.220 align:start position:0%
so you can probably illuminate that a
 
00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a good piece of
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
institution institutional knowledge that
 
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
you're passing along there we do
 
00:51:05.569 --> 00:51:05.579 align:start position:0%
typically form subcommittees when we
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
retain bills because the purpose of
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
retaining a bill is to study it further
 
00:51:10.319 --> 00:51:11.630 align:start position:0%
retaining a bill is to study it further
so

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
subcommittees are the best way to do
 
00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
that representative Thomas sure
 
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
um I um if we don't know the answer
 
00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:20.819 align:start position:0%
perhaps we can contact the clerk on this
 
00:51:20.819 --> 00:51:22.609 align:start position:0%
perhaps we can contact the clerk on this
during

00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
during
 
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
a vote for an amendment during exact
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
session if the vote is a tie
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
is that does that mean the amendment
 
00:51:30.599 --> 00:51:31.609 align:start position:0%
is that does that mean the amendment
fails

00:51:31.609 --> 00:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
fails
 
00:51:31.619 --> 00:51:35.930 align:start position:0%
fails
yes

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:40.740 align:start position:0%
I just want to
 
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
suss a little bit more about how we do
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
amendments on this committee I have
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
presented bills to other committees
 
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
um where there was just a very small
 
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
Amendment say changing the date that the
 
00:51:54.049 --> 00:51:54.059 align:start position:0%
bill would take effect and so at the
 
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
time that I presented the bill I also
 
00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
presented the amendment because it was
 
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
such a small thing and so we did have a
 
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
situation last week on Tuesday's Bill
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
hearing date where we said we're not
 
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
hearing amendments at the time that we
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
hear the bill which leaves me in this
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
weird conundrum where well if we can't
 
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
hear an amendment and that might
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
potentially cause a subcommittee to want
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
to get together and do something how is
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
this committee going to handle that
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm just following advice given to me
 
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
by the house clerk Paul Smith who told
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
us that amendments cannot be considered
 
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
during public hearing only during an
 
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
and as I explained
 
00:52:40.809 --> 00:52:40.819 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing where that
 
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
situation came up it's okay to talk in
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
general terms about the about the change
 
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
you want to make in an amendment
 
00:52:51.069 --> 00:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
but the committee is not going to
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
consider the language of the amendment
 
00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
and that's advice I got directly from
 
00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:02.900 align:start position:0%
the clerk who is an expert on Mason's
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
rules of procedure and that's the way we
 
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:13.569 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:53:13.569 --> 00:53:13.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
representative Jack has a question yeah
 
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you uh someone who is not on the
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
committee can draft an amendment for the
 
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
committee's consideration but when the
 
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
executive session happens someone on the
 
00:53:25.849 --> 00:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
committee must move the amendment
 
00:53:28.849 --> 00:53:28.859 align:start position:0%
for it to be considered unless it was
 
00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
the senator who drafted the amendment
 
00:53:32.089 --> 00:53:32.099 align:start position:0%
and then you have to get a redraft with
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
good excellent point
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay I'll tell you what let's take a six
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
minute uh recess at this point so we can
 
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:47.990 align:start position:0%
minute uh recess at this point so we can
um

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
take care of personal business and then
 
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
we will resume our activity at 10
 
00:53:55.210 --> 00:53:55.220 align:start position:0%
o'clock by hearing house bill
 
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.020 --> 01:01:57.890 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:01:57.890 --> 01:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
okay let's get started everyone I'd like
 
01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:03.500 align:start position:0%
to open the public hearing on House Bill
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
176. I will remind anyone who wants to
 
01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
speak on this legislation
 
01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:10.970 align:start position:0%
speak on this legislation
to

01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
hand me a pink card
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:19.809 --> 01:02:19.819 align:start position:0%
including the prime sponsor
 
01:02:22.970 --> 01:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
of the speaker of the bill who is
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative Michael Harrington
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
and so representative Harrington as soon
 
01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
as you're ready you can present house
 
01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:36.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
relative to the rules of the site
 
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
this bill's come up in the past let me
 
01:02:49.609 --> 01:02:49.619 align:start position:0%
start with saying that and I think the
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
last time it was sort of Lost in the
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
covet Haze with the justification being
 
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
that since there was no new energy
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
projects uh scheduled in New Hampshire
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
that there was no need to um to have
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
this built now what the bill does it
 
01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:03.970 align:start position:0%
this built now what the bill does it
create

01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:03.980 align:start position:0%
create
 
01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:06.299 align:start position:0%
corrects what I think is a major mistake
 
01:03:08.569 --> 01:03:08.579 align:start position:0%
by the site evaluation committee because
 
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
they way overstepped their Authority
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
there was a bill passed a few years ago
 
01:03:15.049 --> 01:03:15.059 align:start position:0%
basically in response to the Antrim win
 
01:03:18.010 --> 01:03:18.020 align:start position:0%
project which specified a number of new
 
01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
legislative mandated requirements for
 
01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
win projects only
 
01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:25.740 align:start position:0%
and yet the site evaluation committee
 
01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:27.660 align:start position:0%
and their Infinite Wisdom decided to
 
01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
expand that to all energy projects so
 
01:03:32.089 --> 01:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
for example you have an emergency
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
evacuation plan for a transmission line
 
01:03:38.089 --> 01:03:38.099 align:start position:0%
well last I checked no one's living in a
 
01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:40.619 align:start position:0%
transmission line so there's a lot of
 
01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
unnecessary rules it sends a message
 
01:03:46.849 --> 01:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
twofold one it says the Departments are
 
01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
in charge of the state not the
 
01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
legislature and it also sends a message
 
01:03:52.609 --> 01:03:52.619 align:start position:0%
to everybody don't come to New Hampshire
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
because we're going to make life as
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
difficult as possible for you if you
 
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
want to build any energy projects now
 
01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
it's we can debate all day what type of
 
01:04:02.809 --> 01:04:02.819 align:start position:0%
energy project we should make but the
 
01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
fact is we are going to have more energy
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
projects in the state for the simple
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
reason if we're going to electric cars
 
01:04:11.809 --> 01:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
and electric heat and all these other
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
lofty goals we're going to need more
 
01:04:15.730 --> 01:04:15.740 align:start position:0%
electricity in order to do that
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
especially if we plan on closing down
 
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
the fossil fuel facilities so more
 
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
electricity means more projects means
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
more transmission lines if we're going
 
01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
to go with offshore wind well that's
 
01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
really good but the electricity has to
 
01:04:31.490 --> 01:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
go someplace leaving it out in the ocean
 
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
isn't powering a damn thing it's going
 
01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:35.579 align:start position:0%
to come on land and that land requires
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
new transmission lines which will be
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
subject to all sorts of rules that the
 
01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
legislature never required it to be done
 
01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:44.700 align:start position:0%
this is a simple matter of housekeeping
 
01:04:46.609 --> 01:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
telling the site evaluation committee
 
01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
you overstepped your Authority you don't
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
have the legislative approval to do that
 
01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:53.099 align:start position:0%
so change your rules and make them match
 
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
the law it's that simple it doesn't it
 
01:04:57.049 --> 01:04:57.059 align:start position:0%
doesn't it shouldn't be a Democrat a
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
republican conservative liberal fossil
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
fuel no fossil fuel it's just telling a
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
state agency obey the law because you
 
01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
don't have the authority to make it and
 
01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Harrington
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
could you go through each of the
 
01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
specific rule changes that you would
 
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
like to see the site evaluation
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
committee be instructed to change well I
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
suppose I could if we had half a day to
 
01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
spend on this Mr chairman but the uh
 
01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
fact is that there's a whole lengthy
 
01:05:31.849 --> 01:05:31.859 align:start position:0%
list of them and the easiest way to do
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
that is to look at the bill that the the
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
legislation that was passed and compare
 
01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
it to the rules which I'm not uh
 
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
prepared to do today it's a simple
 
01:05:45.049 --> 01:05:45.059 align:start position:0%
matter of saying where the rule exceeds
 
01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
the authority granted by the legislation
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
it needs to be changed to match it and
 
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's what the bill does it
 
01:05:53.569 --> 01:05:53.579 align:start position:0%
simply says go change your rules to
 
01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
match the legislation take the authority
 
01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
that was granted to you make sure you
 
01:05:59.930 --> 01:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
implement the law it was written but you
 
01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
don't expand it to other things that it
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:11.089 --> 01:06:11.099 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions for
 
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington representative
 
01:06:15.289 --> 01:06:15.299 align:start position:0%
McWilliams as a question no
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and um thank you
 
01:06:21.049 --> 01:06:21.059 align:start position:0%
representative for introducing this bill
 
01:06:22.609 --> 01:06:22.619 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:06:25.609 --> 01:06:25.619 align:start position:0%
um for the record I mean this this a
 
01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
similar bill was introduced twice
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
um once in 2022 and once in 2017 and it
 
01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
was uh in both cases it was determined
 
01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
that it was not necessary
 
01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
um but can you you you talked you you
 
01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee has exceeded
 
01:06:45.049 --> 01:06:45.059 align:start position:0%
its legislative Authority
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
who has determined that they have
 
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
exceeded their legislative Authority
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
well for one I have and for a second
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
anybody that can read Because if you
 
01:06:56.329 --> 01:06:56.339 align:start position:0%
look at the rules and you compare it to
 
01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
the law the rule change was a direct
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
result of a law passed in response to
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
the Antrim win project because people
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
wanted uh I mean and to some extent it
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
was necessary because there was not a
 
01:07:10.490 --> 01:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
lot of requirements in there and for
 
01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:11.390 align:start position:0%
lot of requirements in there and for
example

01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
um I I say this because I've been on
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
seven eight nine side evaluation
 
01:07:18.289 --> 01:07:18.299 align:start position:0%
committees in the past
 
01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
um I think I'm the only one in the house
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
who's ever served on one but um
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
they had a lot of holes in there for
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
example there was no requirement for
 
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
decommissioning of wind projects so they
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
didn't have to have no statutory
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
requirement to say that you had to have
 
01:07:37.789 --> 01:07:37.799 align:start position:0%
uh finances put aside so that at the end
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
of your usable life with whoever it is
 
01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
25 years or 30 years that there would be
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
fine money there so you wouldn't just
 
01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
leave this eyesore of an old windmill or
 
01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
hundreds of old windmills sitting on the
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
top of a hill someplace
 
01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
um so there was reasons for the law and
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
the law specified certain things
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
specific to win plans and when
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
facilities only And yet when the rule
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
was written uh it was applied to
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
everybody I wasn't in the legislature at
 
01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
the time this was after I left the
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
commission and uh before I got back into
 
01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
the house and I did contact gel car on
 
01:08:15.529 --> 01:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
it and was basically told that
 
01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
I won't use the exact language I was
 
01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
told but let's just say this is so
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
screwed up no one knows what the hell it
 
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
means anyways so we're passing it
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
and uh that's what happened and it
 
01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
became it became a rule but um if you if
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
you if you look at the the law and you
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
look at the rules you'll you clearly see
 
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
that what was applied exclusively to
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
wind and I referenced the statute here
 
01:08:41.209 --> 01:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
uh was applied in the rules to all types
 
01:08:43.729 --> 01:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
of energy projects which was a gross
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
over reach by the site evaluation
 
01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
you need a follow-up
 
01:08:54.370 --> 01:08:54.380 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you
 
01:08:57.289 --> 01:08:57.299 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
RSA 541a the administrative procedures
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
act specifies that
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
a state agency cannot create rules
 
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
for which it is has not received
 
01:09:12.289 --> 01:09:12.299 align:start position:0%
legislative Authority
 
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
what is the procedure under RSA 541a for
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
dealing with the situation which you
 
01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
describe namely that rules were written
 
01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:24.299 align:start position:0%
without legislative Authority
 
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman thank you for the
 
01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:27.299 align:start position:0%
question but I have to be honest with
 
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
you I don't know I know that I had this
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
bill put in twice now and I also was
 
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
involved in the rulemaking process I
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
submitted comments and like I say I went
 
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
to gel car over it and got nowhere so I
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
just think it's time that we make sure
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
that the uh the law is reflected in the
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
rules and the rules reflect the law and
 
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
not something else I I off the top of my
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
head I don't know what that process is
 
01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:09:59.450 --> 01:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
 
01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:01.490 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
Harrington

01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
Harrington
 
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for introducing
 
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
this bill whoops representative Wendy
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
Thomas had a last minute question yes
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.530 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.689 --> 01:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
would this bill
 
01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
um and I'm looking at uh line
 
01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
um 14 on would this bill eliminate
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
emergency response plans for all energy
 
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
facilities is is that what this is
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
implying it would make the rules reflect
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
what's in the law and if we want to put
 
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
on additional requirements let's just
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
say I don't know for a solar facility uh
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
then we should put those in the law and
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
not uh say well we'll let the site
 
01:10:45.649 --> 01:10:45.659 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee make them up and
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
put them in there that's the whole point
 
01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:48.900 align:start position:0%
of this I think you know on a bigger
 
01:10:51.169 --> 01:10:51.179 align:start position:0%
issue people have to understand if you
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
look at this from a broader ratio New
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and New England have a very
 
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
bad reputation for investing anything in
 
01:11:00.169 --> 01:11:00.179 align:start position:0%
energy whether you're in favor of more
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
against them really doesn't make any
 
01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
difference but we saw what a billion
 
01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
dollars go into Northern Pass and was
 
01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
wasted we've seen hundreds of millions
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
of dollars in the project up in Maine
 
01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
for the transmission which got all the
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
apartments and then was overturned by a
 
01:11:14.090 --> 01:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
referendum petition and now is hung up
 
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
in the courts we saw Antrim wind which
 
01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
is you know is a name plate of think 28
 
01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
megawatts so effectively it's about you
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
know producing about 12 megawatts per
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
hour on uh on average and that took I
 
01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
think six years before they were able to
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
get approval so anything that we do if
 
01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
someone comes in and looks and says wow
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
this state is allowing their uh
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
administrators to create law that makes
 
01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
it more cumbersome and more burdensome
 
01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
on energy projects they're going to say
 
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
nah I'll invest in Oklahoma
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
because they just I'm not going to come
 
01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
here we have a we have a market-based
 
01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
system here where it's Merchant plans
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
and we're sending a big loud message to
 
01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
them we don't want you so all this is
 
01:11:59.810 --> 01:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
again is an attempt to say the laws are
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
written by the legislature and not by
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
the agency and if there's a good reason
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
for putting in some particular
 
01:12:07.729 --> 01:12:07.739 align:start position:0%
requirement that was only applied to win
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
to other facilities then someone should
 
01:12:16.689 --> 01:12:16.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
01:12:20.689 --> 01:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
my question uh one quick question I'm
 
01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
aware that there has been studies and I
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
believe a bill perhaps uh coming forward
 
01:12:33.050 --> 01:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
to reorganize the SEC I'm just wondering
 
01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
if you are aware if that procedures
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
would contain any language in there that
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
would reflect what this bill does I I
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
know there's a one for substantial
 
01:12:44.689 --> 01:12:44.699 align:start position:0%
reorganization of the site evaluation
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
committee and there's some differing
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
opinions on exactly how they should go
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
forward to the best of my knowledge this
 
01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
is not included in there but if this
 
01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
committee was so uh desired I would have
 
01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
no problem with incorporating this with
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
that bill so we only have to deal with
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
one piece of legislation it's necessary
 
01:13:01.490 --> 01:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't have to be a standalone
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
Bill and thank you for bringing that to
 
01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
our attention that's a good point as
 
01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.470 align:start position:0%
our attention that's a good point as
usual

01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
usual
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
that right now you're saying the SEC
 
01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
tends to drag projects out make them
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
take too long have onerous and
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
unnecessary rules it sounds like your
 
01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
testimony has been really focused on
 
01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
streamlining the process so we're not
 
01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
there right now but if we were to enable
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
um five megawatts of solar across the
 
01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
state for any developer who wanted to do
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
that would this bill then make it easier
 
01:13:43.729 --> 01:13:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
um well I'm not a solo installer so it's
 
01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
a little difficult for me to say that
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
but I would think that anytime you
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
remove additional regulations would make
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
it easier and it would be it would take
 
01:13:57.290 --> 01:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
the things that really aren't your main
 
01:13:59.570 --> 01:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
to a solar project that may be germane
 
01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
to a wind project especially a small
 
01:14:03.649 --> 01:14:03.659 align:start position:0%
solar project I remember if it's that
 
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
size it doesn't have to go to the site
 
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee it's a 30 megawatts
 
01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
or bigger or at the request of the
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
governing agency such as the selectman
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
or mayor or city councils so most of the
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
time to be quite honest it would have no
 
01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
effect on five megawatts one way or the
 
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
other because they're not under the site
 
01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee unless for some
 
01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
reason somebody decides to do it and
 
01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
then the site evaluation committee would
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
have to vote to accept it but but
 
01:14:30.649 --> 01:14:30.659 align:start position:0%
anytime you you if let's just say it was
 
01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
a 30 megawatt solar system which would
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
be under this it would be less
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
burdensome because it'd be less
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
requirements and again I'm not saying
 
01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
that everything that's specified in the
 
01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
bill is bad I'm saying what the bill
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
originally said was is it only applies
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
to wind and if we want to look at other
 
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
projects and say well I'm going to take
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
not a b and c but maybe D and F and
 
01:14:53.090 --> 01:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
apply it to solar then we should do that
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
but we should do it through the
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
legislative process not because some
 
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
bureaucrat decided it was a good idea
 
01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:02.330 align:start position:0%
bureaucrat decided it was a good idea
follow-up

01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:15:08.090 --> 01:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
rules other rsas would it make sense in
 
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
your opinion to to do a study on this to
 
01:15:16.130 --> 01:15:16.140 align:start position:0%
really look at the nuts and bolts of
 
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
what it's applying to and how to how to
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
fix this for all energy projects well I
 
01:15:22.970 --> 01:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
mean that could be a follow-up I guess
 
01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
if someone wanted to look into that as a
 
01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
a response to passing this bill but the
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
main function of the bill is to say
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
let's get rid of the administratively
 
01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
created rules that don't reflect the law
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
and then if we wanted to come back and
 
01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
say okay now that we've gotten those out
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
of there because they don't be there
 
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
they don't have the authority to do it
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
but they did it anyways
 
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
um now maybe we want to look at that and
 
01:15:50.330 --> 01:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
and reassign some of those but reassign
 
01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
them through the legislative process not
 
01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
through the administrative rulemaking
 
01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
process which was clearly exceeded in
 
01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:02.649 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:16:02.649 --> 01:16:02.659 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
concurrent with
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
or congruent to the question
 
01:16:09.770 --> 01:16:09.780 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams asked should
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
this bill contain a provision to create
 
01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
a study committee to study this question
 
01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
and see which rules should be revised
 
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
and or put into new legislation I would
 
01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
certainly have no opposition to that
 
01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:23.209 align:start position:0%
certainly have no opposition to that
whatsoever

01:16:23.209 --> 01:16:23.219 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
01:16:23.219 --> 01:16:25.669 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
okay

01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:27.169 --> 01:16:27.179 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further questions
 
01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
for the prime sponsor we'll Now call on
 
01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
the next person who has submitted a pink
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
card on this
 
01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
Bill and that's Meredith Hatfield
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
representing the nature conservancy
 
01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:41.570 align:start position:0%

Conservancy
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
and Miss Hatfield it's good to see you
 
01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
again for long time members of the
 
01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:46.550 align:start position:0%
again for long time members of the
committee

01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
we will uh
 
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
recall that um
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
Miss Hatfield was once the consumer
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
advocate here in the state so welcome
 
01:16:57.649 --> 01:16:57.659 align:start position:0%
nice to see you thank you very much
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
chairman Vos it's good to be back
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
Meredith Hatfield for The Nature
 
01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.229 align:start position:0%
Meredith Hatfield for The Nature

01:17:03.239 --> 01:17:03.890 align:start position:0%
Conservancy
um

01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:03.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
we I did Mark opposed to the bill
 
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
because we did want to raise just a few
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
cautionary comments but I did want to
 
01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:14.540 align:start position:0%
start off by saying that we agree
 
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly with representative
 
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
Harrington that the state will need
 
01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
significant additional new energy
 
01:17:23.209 --> 01:17:23.219 align:start position:0%
resources particularly as he pointed out
 
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
as we Electrify buildings and our
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
transportation systems
 
01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.010 align:start position:0%
transportation systems
however

01:17:30.010 --> 01:17:30.020 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:17:33.169 --> 01:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
these rules We Believe were crafted
 
01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:35.699 align:start position:0%
carefully with a lot of public input by
 
01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
folks who might be impacted by projects
 
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
they were approved by jlcar the joint
 
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on administrative
 
01:17:48.649 --> 01:17:48.659 align:start position:0%
rules which some of you may have sat on
 
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
so we think that
 
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
if there is a concern that the committee
 
01:17:56.689 --> 01:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
is going Beyond its Authority that it
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
would be more appropriate to inquire
 
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps with the office of legislative
 
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
services or with JL Carr to perhaps
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
conduct a proceeding I'm not that
 
01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
familiar with the JL Carr rules but
 
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
there might be an Avenue
 
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
to go through that committee my
 
01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
assumption when I see a rule that's made
 
01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
it through JL Carr is that it is within
 
01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
the statutory authorization that you've
 
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
given to an agency and if you look at
 
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
rules you can actually see the statutory
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
site typically in rules that have been
 
01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you to representative Thomas for
 
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
bringing up House Bill 609 which I think
 
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
it will be coming before your committee
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
soon it strikes us as making sense to
 
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
perhaps hold this bill and consider it
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
in the context of the larger overhaul
 
01:18:50.689 --> 01:18:50.699 align:start position:0%
that is proposed in in chairman vosa's
 
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
bill so that you could consider these
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
issues together
 
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
um I think another option would be to
 
01:18:58.610 --> 01:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
actually file a petition with a site
 
01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee itself
 
01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
um asking it to conduct this inquiry and
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
consider whether their rules are
 
01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
appropriately drafted and I'm sure that
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
there would be a lot of folks who
 
01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
propose energy projects as well as folks
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
with other interests who would be likely
 
01:19:19.689 --> 01:19:19.699 align:start position:0%
interested in participating
 
01:19:24.770 --> 01:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
and I also just wanted to point the
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
committee to RSA
 
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
162h16 which is the current findings and
 
01:19:36.649 --> 01:19:36.659 align:start position:0%
certificate issuance section in the
 
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
current SEC law which um you know has
 
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
language about the types of
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
considerations that the SEC should
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
should consider when it's considering
 
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
whether to issue a certificate it talks
 
01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
about not unduly in interfering with
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
orderly developments no unreasonable
 
01:19:57.530 --> 01:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
adverse effects on a range of topics
 
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
so I I do think that the SEC that you've
 
01:20:03.169 --> 01:20:03.179 align:start position:0%
created the SEC to be an expert agency
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
to consider things you know that frankly
 
01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
would be pretty complicated and take a
 
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
lot of time for for legislators to to uh
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
consider so so I also do think that
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
there may be times when
 
01:20:21.649 --> 01:20:21.659 align:start position:0%
uh party in an SEC proceeding proposes
 
01:20:24.169 --> 01:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
something and the committee thinks it's
 
01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
a reasonable thing to add to a
 
01:20:27.709 --> 01:20:27.719 align:start position:0%
certificate and sometimes all of the
 
01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
parties to a case might agree so that
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
you know the committee does have some
 
01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
Authority I think to consider general
 
01:20:37.610 --> 01:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
public health and safety and other
 
01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
issues thank you
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you that's great input
 
01:20:46.010 --> 01:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
I hadn't thought about appealing
 
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
directly to the SEC to modify its rules
 
01:20:51.169 --> 01:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
but that certainly is another way to
 
01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
accomplish the same
 
01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:56.870 align:start position:0%
accomplish the same
goal

01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
unless it doesn't work of course any
 
01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Summers
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:21:05.689 --> 01:21:05.699 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is just a
 
01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
clarification for myself uh the uh
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
is it not the job of the legislature to
 
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.189 align:start position:0%
is it not the job of the legislature to
to

01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:21:13.199 --> 01:21:13.750 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
to understand and change and refrain a
 
01:21:22.330 --> 01:21:22.340 align:start position:0%
uh bring in I guess if a agency
 
01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
misinterprets a law to actually go
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
follow what's actually in the law and
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:33.310 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:21:36.770 --> 01:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
yes I think that when you're a party to
 
01:21:38.630 --> 01:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
an agency proceeding you have several
 
01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
options one of them is to appeal the
 
01:21:43.729 --> 01:21:43.739 align:start position:0%
agency finding to a court and what you
 
01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
would be asking the court to do is look
 
01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
at the legislative intents so I think
 
01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
there are a few different Avenues you
 
01:21:51.169 --> 01:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
can take if an agency does something if
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
you're an applicant or if you're seeking
 
01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
a permit and and you don't like the
 
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
outcome there are different options but
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
certainly I think the legislature for
 
01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
example on on the issue of sound the
 
01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
legislature certainly can clarify
 
01:22:08.209 --> 01:22:08.219 align:start position:0%
um you know what what you meant when you
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
told an agency to ensure that sound
 
01:22:14.090 --> 01:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
impacts you know didn't interfere with
 
01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
someone's enjoyment of their property or
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
something like that or a business that
 
01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
was near a proposed energy facility
 
01:22:24.410 --> 01:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would caution
 
01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
you know the reason we have agencies
 
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
like Des or doe or the SEC is because
 
01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:32.870 align:start position:0%
like Des or doe or the SEC is because
they

01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
you know they take the time they have
 
01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
the time to put people under oath and
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
have expert Witnesses come in and so
 
01:22:41.209 --> 01:22:41.219 align:start position:0%
when it comes to you know what's the
 
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
decibel level you know that to me is
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
something that you would leave to an
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
agency now if you saw the agency setting
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
a limit of zero decibels for all the
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
energy projects obviously you know we're
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
not going to get any builds so I you
 
01:22:57.890 --> 01:22:57.900 align:start position:0%
know I do think that that there
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
certainly I mean you you write the laws
 
01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
of the state so certainly there's a
 
01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
major role for you to set policy
 
01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:04.850 align:start position:0%
major role for you to set policy
Direction

01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
Direction
 
01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
um but I do think there's also a role
 
01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
for the expertise that an agency can
 
01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:10.550 align:start position:0%
for the expertise that an agency can
consider

01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
um so wouldn't this uh Bill be a way
 
01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
another way of the legislature actually
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
clarifying the intent of the law
 
01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
I I do think it could be I think some of
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
the language
 
01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:30.530 align:start position:0%
the language
um

01:23:30.530 --> 01:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:33.169 --> 01:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
you know sort of proclaiming that things
 
01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
are beyond the law
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
might be a little bit challenging for
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
the SEC to
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
I I think it's not
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
perfectly clear what you would like them
 
01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
to do so I think if you wanted to pass
 
01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:49.100 align:start position:0%
this bill you know it certainly could be
 
01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
revised to reflect you know your
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
specific intent on these different
 
01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:56.149 align:start position:0%
specific intent on these different
topics

01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.330 --> 01:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh some of us
 
01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
Hatfield or are there any particular
 
01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
rules uh identified here that uh you
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to the specifics of the
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
visual assessment or the sound
 
01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
assessment but I do know that for a lot
 
01:24:25.610 --> 01:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
of stakeholders those rules are very
 
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
important so that when they engage in a
 
01:24:30.410 --> 01:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee process
 
01:24:31.970 --> 01:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's sort of
 
01:24:34.250 --> 01:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
guidelines or there's a framework where
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
people can ask the SEC for certain
 
01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:37.729 align:start position:0%
people can ask the SEC for certain
outcomes

01:24:37.729 --> 01:24:37.739 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
um so I don't I don't have a specific
 
01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
issue with any of the rules as they
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
so uh sound assessment for a solar panel
 
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.550 align:start position:0%
so uh sound assessment for a solar panel
installation

01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
installation
 
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:03.169 --> 01:25:03.179 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if the committee has
 
01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
required that
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
um I can't speak to any specifics about
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry
 
01:25:11.930 --> 01:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:14.689 --> 01:25:14.699 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington uh no you
 
01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
can't ask a question I'm not going to
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
ask you a question I just wanted to
 
01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
State a clarification of the bill okay
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
clarification so so one thing that
 
01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
people are aware of this bill does not
 
01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
limit the authority of the site
 
01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee as I stated in the
 
01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
past for example on decommissioning the
 
01:25:32.689 --> 01:25:32.699 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee imposed that
 
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
as a requirement for the permit it
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't mandated by law all the bill does
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
it says the remove the mandates and
 
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
leave the discretion of the committee
 
01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
decide like is just brought up yes we
 
01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
want we're going to have the law
 
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
requires us to have a sound evaluation
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
for a windmill but not for a solar
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
facility because there's no need for it
 
01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't if they wanted to there'd be
 
01:25:58.490 --> 01:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
nothing that would prevent them from
 
01:26:01.129 --> 01:26:01.139 align:start position:0%
doing that it simply says that they uh
 
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't restrict The Authority just
 
01:26:05.149 --> 01:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
says they don't have to because that was
 
01:26:08.209 --> 01:26:08.219 align:start position:0%
never the intent of the original Law
 
01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
 
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you uh for taking
 
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
my question so would it be your view or
 
01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
your opinion that
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
um these rules do not exceed the
 
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
legislative Authority that was provided
 
01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
by the legislature
 
01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
it's my view and as I said before
 
01:26:37.129 --> 01:26:37.139 align:start position:0%
um because they were approved by JL Carr
 
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
and that is such a rigorous process that
 
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
would be my view
 
01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:43.189 align:start position:0%
would be my view
um

01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
you know I I think
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington might he can
 
01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but I think what
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
he might be getting at is the
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
application of rules to cases that he
 
01:26:57.290 --> 01:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
thinks the committee doesn't have
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
Authority for so for example
 
01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:02.149 align:start position:0%
Authority for so for example
um

01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
on line 11 he refers the bill refers to
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
a site 30105 requiring
 
01:27:11.450 --> 01:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
um visual impact assessments for all
 
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
facilities and on line 12 the bill says
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
such assessment is required for wind
 
01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
energy systems only
 
01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:20.330 align:start position:0%
energy systems only
um

01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:23.450 --> 01:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
so I I think if the rules have been
 
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
approved by JL Carr that the committee
 
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
did have the authority to promulgate
 
01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:29.810 align:start position:0%
did have the authority to promulgate
them

01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions I'd like to
 
01:27:38.689 --> 01:27:38.699 align:start position:0%
thank Miss

uh in attendance today who would like to
 
01:27:54.410 --> 01:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none I guess we shall
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
176 and representative closure will give
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
us a briefing on
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet responses to this bill
 
01:28:15.310 --> 01:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman rules
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill 176 the blue sheet
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
is pro zero
 
01:28:25.729 --> 01:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
against con zero against
 
01:28:25.739 --> 01:28:27.290 align:start position:0%
against con zero against
online

01:28:27.290 --> 01:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
online
 
01:28:29.149 --> 01:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
one pro
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
what if
 
01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:38.450 --> 01:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
well this is unexpected I really didn't
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
anticipate that um
 
01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
this hearing would only last a half hour
 
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise I would have scheduled it for
 
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
a half hour
 
01:28:51.649 --> 01:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately we cannot change a
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
noticed public hearings time so we will
 
01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
have to wait until 11 o'clock
 
01:28:59.930 --> 01:28:59.940 align:start position:0%
before we can begin the
 
01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 208
 
01:29:05.209 --> 01:29:05.219 align:start position:0%
is there any member of the committee who
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
has anything that they would like to
 
01:29:09.770 --> 01:29:09.780 align:start position:0%
discuss since we have apparently some
 
01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:12.780 align:start position:0%
free time representative notter yes I
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
would like to request that we have a
 
01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
caucus a republican caucus or maybe the
 
01:29:18.050 --> 01:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
Democrats can have their own caucus
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
01:29:22.370 --> 01:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea so
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
we will recess the committee until 11
 
01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:26.570 align:start position:0%
we will recess the committee until 11
o'clock

01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
and allow individual caucuses to do
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
anything they feel they must we will
 
02:00:53.930 --> 02:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:57.050 --> 02:00:57.060 align:start position:0%
everyone 11 o'clock time to start the
 
02:00:59.149 --> 02:00:59.159 align:start position:0%

Will dark well Darby I'm from Nashua
 
02:01:39.410 --> 02:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
Ward 8 I am co-sponsoring House Bill 208
 
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:46.430 --> 02:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
testify before this bill and and wrote
 
02:01:49.250 --> 02:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
up a paper but and you know in sake of
 
02:01:51.649 --> 02:01:51.659 align:start position:0%
time I'm going to read representative
 
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
cutchen's testimony instead um I have
 
02:01:56.810 --> 02:01:56.820 align:start position:0%
submitted my own testimony online and
 
02:01:59.810 --> 02:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
via email if you would have the
 
02:02:03.290 --> 02:02:03.300 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh to read through that
 
02:02:03.300 --> 02:02:04.129 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh to read through that
um

02:02:04.129 --> 02:02:04.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:07.189 --> 02:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna I'm just gonna read uh what
 
02:02:10.490 --> 02:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
she was intending to to state
 
02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
I got representative
 
02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
since we have a written copy of her
 
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
testimony rather than reading it could
 
02:02:20.589 --> 02:02:20.599 align:start position:0%
you summarize it
 
02:02:23.950 --> 02:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
because we can read it at our Leisure
 
02:02:26.629 --> 02:02:26.639 align:start position:0%
rather than have you reading it to us
 
02:02:28.669 --> 02:02:28.679 align:start position:0%
would that be possible or would you
 
02:02:30.649 --> 02:02:30.659 align:start position:0%
prefer to read it
 
02:02:30.659 --> 02:02:31.310 align:start position:0%
prefer to read it
um

02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:33.169 --> 02:02:33.179 align:start position:0%
I unfortunately I don't think I will do
 
02:02:35.570 --> 02:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
it do do justice I have read it several
 
02:02:37.609 --> 02:02:37.619 align:start position:0%
times myself but I'm not sure that I'll
 
02:02:40.609 --> 02:02:40.619 align:start position:0%
be able to summarize it completely
 
02:02:42.589 --> 02:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
okay understood go right ahead and read
 
02:02:45.729 --> 02:02:45.739 align:start position:0%

02:02:48.109 --> 02:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
good morning colleagues and esteemed

guests for the record my name is
 
02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
Jacqueline Gretchen and I represent
 
02:02:54.410 --> 02:02:54.420 align:start position:0%

Manchester here in the New Hampshire
 
02:02:55.980 --> 02:02:56.930 align:start position:0%
Manchester here in the New Hampshire
house

02:02:56.930 --> 02:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:02:59.089 --> 02:02:59.099 align:start position:0%
I'm exceedingly sorry that I cannot be
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
here today to introduce this important
 
02:03:03.290 --> 02:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
bill in person but as the wise man once
 
02:03:05.930 --> 02:03:05.940 align:start position:0%
said I see is dicey and the ankle
 
02:03:07.850 --> 02:03:07.860 align:start position:0%
surgery waits for no man but the
 
02:03:07.860 --> 02:03:09.470 align:start position:0%
surgery waits for no man but the
orthopedist

02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
orthopedist
 
02:03:11.390 --> 02:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
I am sponsoring this bill first and
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
foremost because the people of New
 
02:03:14.689 --> 02:03:14.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire want the state to have a
 
02:03:15.950 --> 02:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
climate plan
 
02:03:17.810 --> 02:03:17.820 align:start position:0%
this essential this is essentially
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
identical to bills that were introduced
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
in the last two sessions in 2020 as
 
02:03:26.450 --> 02:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1664 it passed the house with
 
02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:30.300 align:start position:0%
a margin of 197 to 123 but died at covet
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
Senate a coveted death in the Senate
 
02:03:36.169 --> 02:03:36.179 align:start position:0%
last term as House Bill 172 it was
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
tabled along with many other bills from
 
02:03:40.490 --> 02:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
our committee
 
02:03:42.410 --> 02:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
however the public support for both of
 
02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
these bills was overwhelming there were
 
02:03:46.850 --> 02:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
310 people signed in to support House
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
Bill 172 when it was heard in 2021 and
 
02:03:52.370 --> 02:03:52.380 align:start position:0%
only 30 against all but four of whom
 
02:03:54.530 --> 02:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
were either elected officials or fossil
 
02:03:56.330 --> 02:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
fuel lobbyists
 
02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
we have a mandate from our constant
 
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
constituents to act on climate
 
02:04:03.290 --> 02:04:03.300 align:start position:0%
secondly I'm sponsoring this bill
 
02:04:05.209 --> 02:04:05.219 align:start position:0%
because I believe the state legislature
 
02:04:07.550 --> 02:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
has a responsibility to protect our
 
02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:08.570 align:start position:0%
has a responsibility to protect our
residents

02:04:08.570 --> 02:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
residents
 
02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
a safeguard and Safeguard New Hampshire
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
resources for future Generations
 
02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
climate change is real and already
 
02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
having an impact on New Hampshire
 
02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:20.030 align:start position:0%
having an impact on New Hampshire
residents

02:04:20.030 --> 02:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
residents
 
02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
businesses and the government
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
others testifying here today can speak
 
02:04:27.470 --> 02:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
in details to these effects bajada
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
Summers negatively impact respiratory
 
02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:32.330 align:start position:0%
Summers negatively impact respiratory
health

02:04:32.330 --> 02:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:34.729 --> 02:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
warmer Winters are killer for tourism
 
02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
and the revenue in the North country and
 
02:04:38.990 --> 02:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
even a few inches of sea level rise
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
raise the cost of living and doing
 
02:04:43.790 --> 02:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
business on the Seacoast
 
02:04:46.609 --> 02:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
these effects will not only be will only
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
become more substantial over time
 
02:04:51.890 --> 02:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
the science is clear that climate change
 
02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
acceleration due to greenhouse gas
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
emissions is something that everyone who
 
02:04:58.490 --> 02:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
lives in a developed country contributes
 
02:05:01.129 --> 02:05:01.139 align:start position:0%
to and it's something that we will all
 
02:05:04.010 --> 02:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
need to contribute to slowing we have a
 
02:05:06.169 --> 02:05:06.179 align:start position:0%
responsibility to our children and
 
02:05:07.729 --> 02:05:07.739 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and the other future
 
02:05:11.209 --> 02:05:11.219 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state to act on climate
 
02:05:13.310 --> 02:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
with that said I recognize that not
 
02:05:15.410 --> 02:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
everyone on this committee agrees with a
 
02:05:18.050 --> 02:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
98 of earth scientists
 
02:05:20.270 --> 02:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
on the role of greenhouse gas greenhouse
 
02:05:22.669 --> 02:05:22.679 align:start position:0%
gases in driving climate change
 
02:05:25.609 --> 02:05:25.619 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about the money instead
 
02:05:27.890 --> 02:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
there's a substantial evidence that
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
Renewables and low-carbon Technologies
 
02:05:34.250 --> 02:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
in general are on a learning curves or
 
02:05:36.169 --> 02:05:36.179 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative I'm going to
 
02:05:39.290 --> 02:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
have to uh interrupt you here
 
02:05:41.149 --> 02:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
we have a limited amount of time to
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
discuss this bill
 
02:05:45.669 --> 02:05:45.679 align:start position:0%
and regrettably
 
02:05:49.129 --> 02:05:49.139 align:start position:0%
representative cretian's testimony seems
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
to be about climate change rather than
 
02:05:54.830 --> 02:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
the substance of this bill I think what
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
the committee members would really like
 
02:05:58.930 --> 02:05:58.940 align:start position:0%
to hear is
 
02:06:02.330 --> 02:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
what this bill does and how it does it
 
02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:04.850 align:start position:0%
what this bill does and how it does it
and

02:06:04.850 --> 02:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:08.209 --> 02:06:08.219 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's something that we
 
02:06:09.950 --> 02:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
should consider doing
 
02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:11.629 align:start position:0%
should consider doing
so

02:06:11.629 --> 02:06:11.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:15.229 --> 02:06:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.450 --> 02:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
reading the rest of her testimony we can
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
read that at our Leisure and I'm going
 
02:06:22.970 --> 02:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
to ask you instead if you could
 
02:06:25.250 --> 02:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
discuss some of the specifics of the
 
02:06:28.250 --> 02:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
bill what does it actually do
 
02:06:28.260 --> 02:06:30.950 align:start position:0%
bill what does it actually do
and

02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:35.930 --> 02:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
why should we consider doing that action
 
02:06:35.940 --> 02:06:36.890 align:start position:0%
why should we consider doing that action
sure

02:06:36.890 --> 02:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:42.169 --> 02:06:42.179 align:start position:0%
so the the as stated in the bill it sets
 
02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
up greenhouse gas emission goals for the
 
02:06:47.810 --> 02:06:47.820 align:start position:0%
state and a climate action plan what
 
02:06:50.089 --> 02:06:50.099 align:start position:0%
that means as I read the bill and as I
 
02:06:52.070 --> 02:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
have discussed with representative
 
02:06:55.070 --> 02:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
cutchen is that all is that the
 
02:06:58.430 --> 02:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
departments in the state will have that
 
02:07:00.830 --> 02:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
are that have control over
 
02:07:02.689 --> 02:07:02.699 align:start position:0%
um and have influence over greenhouse
 
02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
gas emissions will end up setting up a
 
02:07:10.010 --> 02:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
um greenhouse gas objectives and goals
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
and and the Department of Environmental
 
02:07:14.330 --> 02:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
Services will measure progress towards
 
02:07:15.470 --> 02:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
those goals
 
02:07:17.870 --> 02:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
I believe the reason that
 
02:07:19.970 --> 02:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
um representative kretchen was talking
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
about the progress towards renewable
 
02:07:27.310 --> 02:07:27.320 align:start position:0%
energies is because the developmental
 
02:07:29.770 --> 02:07:29.780 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
02:07:29.780 --> 02:07:31.870 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
will

02:07:31.870 --> 02:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:07:35.870 --> 02:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
apply those that that experiential curve
 
02:07:39.050 --> 02:07:39.060 align:start position:0%
towards the towards the plan that they
 
02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:45.410 --> 02:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to suggest that members of the
 
02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
committee forego questions of
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
Representative Darby and uh
 
02:07:56.750 --> 02:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
let us listen to some of the other folks
 
02:07:58.729 --> 02:07:58.739 align:start position:0%
who want to testify on this bill the
 
02:08:00.010 --> 02:08:00.020 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
02:08:02.629 --> 02:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services we have another
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative who would like to testify
 
02:08:08.209 --> 02:08:08.219 align:start position:0%
I have seven cards here already so we're
 
02:08:09.649 --> 02:08:09.659 align:start position:0%
going to have to start limiting people
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
to two to three minutes very soon here
 
02:08:15.530 --> 02:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to move on if that's okay
 
02:08:17.810 --> 02:08:17.820 align:start position:0%
with you representative Darby yes thank
 
02:08:17.820 --> 02:08:18.530 align:start position:0%
with you representative Darby yes thank
you

02:08:18.530 --> 02:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:08:20.330 --> 02:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:08:24.709 --> 02:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
so I'll call next representative Jared
 
02:08:27.229 --> 02:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if this is Sullivan or
 
02:08:27.239 --> 02:08:28.370 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if this is Sullivan or
Sully

02:08:28.370 --> 02:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
Sully
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
Sullivan okay representative Jared
 
02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:32.209 align:start position:0%
Sullivan okay representative Jared
Sullivan

02:08:32.209 --> 02:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
Sullivan
 
02:08:35.689 --> 02:08:35.699 align:start position:0%
representing Grafton District 2.
 
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:08:39.589 --> 02:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm here representing Grafton
 
02:08:41.330 --> 02:08:41.340 align:start position:0%
District which is Bethlehem and
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
Franconia up in Northern New Hampshire
 
02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
so the North country as we like to call
 
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
it oftentimes we feel like we're ignored
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
up there regardless of our party when
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
we're because most of the population
 
02:08:52.189 --> 02:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
being down there we have a few people
 
02:08:54.350 --> 02:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
representing us and we do have a unique
 
02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
set of needs up there that oftentimes
 
02:08:58.129 --> 02:08:58.139 align:start position:0%
aren't thought about down here in
 
02:09:00.410 --> 02:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
southern more populated part of the
 
02:09:03.229 --> 02:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
state my district specifically has Canon
 
02:09:05.330 --> 02:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
located in it but also we have a big
 
02:09:07.609 --> 02:09:07.619 align:start position:0%
industry with snowmobiling hunting
 
02:09:10.550 --> 02:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
fishing and the majority of the people
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
my constituents are served by Wells not
 
02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
by sewer or or water systems and all of
 
02:09:18.770 --> 02:09:18.780 align:start position:0%
these things have are being threatened
 
02:09:21.649 --> 02:09:21.659 align:start position:0%
by climate change and so I'm very much
 
02:09:22.970 --> 02:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
in support of a bill that can help
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
reduce this um the ski industry has
 
02:09:29.390 --> 02:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
shortened by I believe nearly a week we
 
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
have a lot of moose that are dying you
 
02:09:33.109 --> 02:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
can look at this you can look this up
 
02:09:34.970 --> 02:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
yourself because snow is happening later
 
02:09:38.450 --> 02:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
and later every year the ticks are
 
02:09:40.970 --> 02:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
killing off infant moose without a born
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
and I believe the last study I read was
 
02:09:46.070 --> 02:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
that 70 of the moose in Maine didn't
 
02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
make it through the winter last year
 
02:09:49.010 --> 02:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
newborn moose didn't make it through the
 
02:09:52.010 --> 02:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
winter so I'm in support of this bill it
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
impacts my district impacts Northern New
 
02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire impacts maple sugar industry
 
02:09:58.810 --> 02:09:58.820 align:start position:0%
up there which is the biggest part of
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
the state that produces Maple sugars up
 
02:10:03.649 --> 02:10:03.659 align:start position:0%
by me so these are all things that are
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
negatively impacted and you know it's
 
02:10:07.070 --> 02:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's oftentimes things that maybe people
 
02:10:08.209 --> 02:10:08.219 align:start position:0%
aren't thinking so I'm just trying to
 
02:10:10.070 --> 02:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
provide another perspective that this
 
02:10:11.689 --> 02:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
that climate change is real it's
 
02:10:13.790 --> 02:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
negatively impacting everybody and it's
 
02:10:16.370 --> 02:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
really hurting the livelihoods of some
 
02:10:19.070 --> 02:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
of the people in my community a lot of
 
02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
people in my we had a drought Last
 
02:10:22.010 --> 02:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
Summer we've had a drought every summer
 
02:10:24.890 --> 02:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
now for the last three four years and
 
02:10:26.629 --> 02:10:26.639 align:start position:0%
numerous constituents have run out of
 
02:10:30.649 --> 02:10:30.659 align:start position:0%
water and the some people can't drink
 
02:10:32.330 --> 02:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
the water so they have to go and and
 
02:10:33.950 --> 02:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
fill up at these local Springs and
 
02:10:35.689 --> 02:10:35.699 align:start position:0%
they're just trickling out I mean those
 
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
lines getting water at one point in the
 
02:10:40.129 --> 02:10:40.139 align:start position:0%
summer so with that I'll wrap up my
 
02:10:42.589 --> 02:10:42.599 align:start position:0%
testimony and have it take any questions
 
02:10:44.689 --> 02:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
if anybody has any
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
great thank you representative we
 
02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here we uh I will
 
02:10:50.890 --> 02:10:50.900 align:start position:0%
ask you a quick question sure uh
 
02:10:53.810 --> 02:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
pertaining specifically to the bill
 
02:10:56.750 --> 02:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned water issues in the North
 
02:10:59.330 --> 02:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
Country you mentioned tick problems in
 
02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
the North Country
 
02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:01.669 align:start position:0%
the North Country
Etc

02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
02:11:04.550 --> 02:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
how do you see what can you point to
 
02:11:07.010 --> 02:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
specifically in this bill that will help
 
02:11:09.890 --> 02:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
address some of those issues sure I
 
02:11:12.290 --> 02:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
think yeah so the the idea is going
 
02:11:14.209 --> 02:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
after the climate change issue more
 
02:11:16.910 --> 02:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
broadly so if we can do our part I know
 
02:11:18.290 --> 02:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
it's a global issue and so we have to
 
02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
work globally but we can't we are part
 
02:11:21.890 --> 02:11:21.900 align:start position:0%
of the global ecosystem so if we're
 
02:11:23.390 --> 02:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
going to ignore New Hampshire that's
 
02:11:24.830 --> 02:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
certainly not going to support anybody
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
else anywhere else in the in the world
 
02:11:28.669 --> 02:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
trying to do their part and so we need
 
02:11:30.109 --> 02:11:30.119 align:start position:0%
to reduce the amount of missions that
 
02:11:31.370 --> 02:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
were happening and that's what this bill
 
02:11:33.770 --> 02:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
aims to do and that's why I'm in support
 
02:11:34.970 --> 02:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
of it
 
02:11:37.669 --> 02:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
okay great any further questions for the
 
02:11:37.679 --> 02:11:39.530 align:start position:0%
okay great any further questions for the
representative

02:12:12.109 --> 02:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
Division
 
02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
we are the division of Des that would be
 
02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
primarily tasked with most of the work
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
that's required in this bill Des does
 
02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
not take a position on the uh on the
 
02:12:23.390 --> 02:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
merits of the bill itself
 
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
um however we would like to point out a
 
02:12:28.490 --> 02:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
couple of concerns
 
02:12:32.390 --> 02:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
first of all by way of context Des was
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh very significantly involved in the
 
02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
development of the 2009 climate action
 
02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
plan that is still in existence today
 
02:12:43.669 --> 02:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
many of whose recommendations
 
02:12:48.410 --> 02:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
um uh are still supported at this point
 
02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
that plan involved probably almost a
 
02:12:55.189 --> 02:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
two-year process several Des staff uh
 
02:12:57.290 --> 02:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
there was a 29-member task force that
 
02:12:59.209 --> 02:12:59.219 align:start position:0%
the governor appointed to oversee the
 
02:13:00.890 --> 02:13:00.900 align:start position:0%
development of that plan
 
02:13:03.470 --> 02:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
and it required significant resources
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
most of which at that time were paid for
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
by funds from a major national
 
02:13:11.450 --> 02:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
settlement on air pollution with major
 
02:13:14.770 --> 02:13:14.780 align:start position:0%
power plants in the midwest that EPA
 
02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
allocated some of that funding to Des
 
02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
and therefore we were able to have
 
02:13:23.450 --> 02:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
positions available to support that
 
02:13:26.810 --> 02:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
support that work you might notice that
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note on this bill indicates
 
02:13:33.470 --> 02:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
that we would probably that funding has
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
been used and is is now gone so
 
02:13:39.649 --> 02:13:39.659 align:start position:0%
um this bill does not allow allocate any
 
02:13:41.629 --> 02:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
additional funding for Staffing to do
 
02:13:45.050 --> 02:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
the work that's planned in this bill and
 
02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
so we would probably need a at least two
 
02:13:52.729 --> 02:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
maybe more like three uh additional
 
02:13:55.729 --> 02:13:55.739 align:start position:0%
staff to accomplish the work that's
 
02:13:58.490 --> 02:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
required in this bill and
 
02:14:00.109 --> 02:14:00.119 align:start position:0%
um as I noted there's there's no
 
02:14:03.109 --> 02:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
appropriation also the timelines in the
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
bill are given the scope and magnitude
 
02:14:08.930 --> 02:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
of the task and the potential economic
 
02:14:13.390 --> 02:14:13.400 align:start position:0%
impacts of a significant
 
02:14:16.270 --> 02:14:16.280 align:start position:0%
well thought out climate action plan
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
those potential economic impacts to be
 
02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:21.970 align:start position:0%
those potential economic impacts to be
considered

02:14:21.970 --> 02:14:21.980 align:start position:0%
considered
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
in the development of that plan would
 
02:14:27.649 --> 02:14:27.659 align:start position:0%
require a significant amount of economic
 
02:14:30.109 --> 02:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
analysis that our department does not
 
02:14:32.089 --> 02:14:32.099 align:start position:0%
have the capability for so therefore we
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
would probably want to rely on some type
 
02:14:39.530 --> 02:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
of a a consultant to to assist us with
 
02:14:42.109 --> 02:14:42.119 align:start position:0%
that type of economic analysis that work
 
02:14:44.410 --> 02:14:44.420 align:start position:0%
was done
 
02:14:46.970 --> 02:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
external to The Climate action plan and
 
02:14:48.169 --> 02:14:48.179 align:start position:0%
it was funded by the charitable
 
02:14:50.569 --> 02:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
Foundation back in the two the
 
02:14:53.870 --> 02:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
development of the 2009 plan we worked
 
02:14:56.089 --> 02:14:56.099 align:start position:0%
closely with consultants and the
 
02:14:57.770 --> 02:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
development of that but we did not do
 
02:14:59.330 --> 02:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
the work ourselves
 
02:15:02.750 --> 02:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
so in in essence basically we don't feel
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
the time frames contemplated in this
 
02:15:07.609 --> 02:15:07.619 align:start position:0%
plan are sufficient
 
02:15:12.370 --> 02:15:12.380 align:start position:0%
for for us to do a meaningful uh job and
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
uh do all the work that's anticipated
 
02:15:18.290 --> 02:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
under the bill and second we do not have
 
02:15:21.050 --> 02:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
the Staffing and resources and would
 
02:15:23.209 --> 02:15:23.219 align:start position:0%
would certainly need
 
02:15:23.219 --> 02:15:23.750 align:start position:0%
would certainly need
um

02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:26.030 --> 02:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
some type of allocation to do that work
 
02:15:27.589 --> 02:15:27.599 align:start position:0%
we don't have those staff available
 
02:15:30.050 --> 02:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
today that we had 10 years ago
 
02:15:32.030 --> 02:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
02:15:36.410 --> 02:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:39.290 --> 02:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Fitzgerald for being here
 
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
and submitting your testimony on this
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
bill today yes by the way I did some I
 
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
did give a letter I passed a letter out
 
02:15:48.290 --> 02:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
to each one summarizing my testimony or
 
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you testimony and I do have a
 
02:15:52.010 --> 02:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
couple of questions about your Lo your
 
02:15:53.569 --> 02:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
letter certainly
 
02:15:55.310 --> 02:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
your letter mentions three full-time
 
02:15:59.390 --> 02:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
equivalent positions would those be
 
02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:01.250 align:start position:0%
equivalent positions would those be
permanent

02:16:01.250 --> 02:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
02:16:03.649 --> 02:16:03.659 align:start position:0%
positions going forward or just would
 
02:16:05.870 --> 02:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
would they just be temporary I wouldn't
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
development of a plan at least one if
 
02:16:09.950 --> 02:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
not two of those positions would
 
02:16:11.870 --> 02:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
probably be long term because the bill
 
02:16:14.209 --> 02:16:14.219 align:start position:0%
does require continuous
 
02:16:14.219 --> 02:16:14.810 align:start position:0%
does require continuous
um

02:16:14.810 --> 02:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:17.569 --> 02:16:17.579 align:start position:0%
uh reporting on greenhouse gas emissions
 
02:16:19.129 --> 02:16:19.139 align:start position:0%
and so on so depending on the amount of
 
02:16:21.229 --> 02:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
work that needed to be done I would I
 
02:16:23.390 --> 02:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
would say at least one of those would be
 
02:16:26.569 --> 02:16:26.579 align:start position:0%
a a long-term position and the other two
 
02:16:29.149 --> 02:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
would be necessary for the during the
 
02:16:30.530 --> 02:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
development of the plan which would
 
02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
probably take
 
02:16:35.570 --> 02:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh best guess on my part would be a two
 
02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
two-year effort
 
02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
um the bill does require that we conduct
 
02:16:43.070 --> 02:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
public listening sessions that involves
 
02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
going out holding hearings
 
02:16:48.290 --> 02:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
you know all kinds of of effort um and
 
02:16:50.089 --> 02:16:50.099 align:start position:0%
then coalescing all of that information
 
02:16:53.690 --> 02:16:53.700 align:start position:0%
and and developing a report and then
 
02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
putting that out to public comment as
 
02:16:58.849 --> 02:16:58.859 align:start position:0%
well so I would say two years would be a
 
02:17:01.070 --> 02:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
minimum necessary to get that
 
02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
work that would be very aggressive
 
02:17:06.230 --> 02:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up to that your letter also
 
02:17:09.049 --> 02:17:09.059 align:start position:0%
says that implementation of a climate
 
02:17:11.810 --> 02:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
plan will likely have an economic impact
 
02:17:15.169 --> 02:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
on the state including energy costs for
 
02:17:18.049 --> 02:17:18.059 align:start position:0%
residents businesses and manufacturers
 
02:17:22.190 --> 02:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
as well as towns schools counties Etc
 
02:17:25.429 --> 02:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
do you imagine that influence on energy
 
02:17:27.410 --> 02:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
costs would be an increase in those
 
02:17:27.420 --> 02:17:31.070 align:start position:0%
costs would be an increase in those
costs

02:17:31.070 --> 02:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:33.230 --> 02:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
um so it would be very difficult to say
 
02:17:35.450 --> 02:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
at this time because it would depend on
 
02:17:37.150 --> 02:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
the plan that was developed obviously
 
02:17:40.490 --> 02:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
but I would suspect that there might be
 
02:17:44.469 --> 02:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
short-term uh impacts to
 
02:17:48.410 --> 02:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
and increases but in the development of
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
the 2009 climate plan we basically
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
determined that most of the measures
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
were ultimately cost saving measures but
 
02:17:59.089 --> 02:17:59.099 align:start position:0%
that cost savings would accrue over time
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
your letter also mentions that it will
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
likely result in Workforce changes does
 
02:18:07.129 --> 02:18:07.139 align:start position:0%
that mean layoffs
 
02:18:10.310 --> 02:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
no I think um I I think what we've seen
 
02:18:13.969 --> 02:18:13.979 align:start position:0%
is uh changes that you know for instance
 
02:18:15.290 --> 02:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
people who might be employed in the
 
02:18:16.849 --> 02:18:16.859 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel industry if there was a move
 
02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
to Renewables might move you know need
 
02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
re-education and move over into uh
 
02:18:25.730 --> 02:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
development of of renewable energy types
 
02:18:28.969 --> 02:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
or or things such as that but
 
02:18:31.070 --> 02:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
um I don't again the client the 2009
 
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
climate action plan we'd be happy to
 
02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
come speak to a committee or
 
02:18:38.349 --> 02:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh on the plan itself but
 
02:18:42.709 --> 02:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
the 2009 plan I think envisioned uh that
 
02:18:45.709 --> 02:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
there would be positive economic
 
02:18:48.770 --> 02:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
um changes I wouldn't certainly would
 
02:18:51.310 --> 02:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
not say there would be no
 
02:18:54.049 --> 02:18:54.059 align:start position:0%
dislocation there might be some certain
 
02:18:57.230 --> 02:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
disruption but the net there would be
 
02:18:59.150 --> 02:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
overall positive benefits to the economy
 
02:19:01.730 --> 02:19:01.740 align:start position:0%
and to employment
 
02:19:03.410 --> 02:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
and finally as someone who's been
 
02:19:05.929 --> 02:19:05.939 align:start position:0%
involved in these kinds of processes for
 
02:19:08.450 --> 02:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
many many years would it be your
 
02:19:10.969 --> 02:19:10.979 align:start position:0%
opinion that a bill that didn't have an
 
02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation in it would be rejected by
 
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
the finance committee
 
02:19:23.450 --> 02:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:25.429 --> 02:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:19:26.810 --> 02:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:19:29.690 --> 02:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
you've listed several reasons to be
 
02:19:32.629 --> 02:19:32.639 align:start position:0%
against this bill yet you say Des takes
 
02:19:35.389 --> 02:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
no position so what are the reasons that
 
02:19:37.790 --> 02:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
Des would not even take a position given
 
02:19:40.969 --> 02:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
all the negative that you just told us
 
02:19:42.650 --> 02:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
well as I mentioned in my opening
 
02:19:45.969 --> 02:19:45.979 align:start position:0%
statement I don't believe Des
 
02:19:49.310 --> 02:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
does not disagree with the basic premise
 
02:19:51.290 --> 02:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
of the bill that the climate planning is
 
02:19:54.410 --> 02:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
is necessary and important our concerns
 
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
are the fact that we don't have the
 
02:19:59.210 --> 02:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
staff and the resources to do it at this
 
02:20:00.590 --> 02:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
point so I would not say that that
 
02:20:02.889 --> 02:20:02.899 align:start position:0%
results in US opposing the bill
 
02:20:05.210 --> 02:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
but we certainly could not say we
 
02:20:07.490 --> 02:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
support it as it stands because of the
 
02:20:10.730 --> 02:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
fiscal impacts and the Staffing and
 
02:20:12.889 --> 02:20:12.899 align:start position:0%
resource concerns that I've outlined so
 
02:20:15.349 --> 02:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
I think we've tried to maybe thread the
 
02:20:20.889 --> 02:20:20.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:24.170 --> 02:20:24.180 align:start position:0%
okay representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
02:20:26.450 --> 02:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
02:20:28.370 --> 02:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
um in the letter
 
02:20:30.170 --> 02:20:30.180 align:start position:0%
um can you just clarify is commissioner
 
02:20:30.180 --> 02:20:31.190 align:start position:0%
um can you just clarify is commissioner
Scott

02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
Scott
 
02:20:33.650 --> 02:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
saying that a 14 year old climate plan
 
02:20:37.010 --> 02:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
document is sufficient for 2023 and
 
02:20:38.450 --> 02:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
02:20:39.770 --> 02:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so I think what we're
 
02:20:42.170 --> 02:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
saying though is that that plan was well
 
02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
thought out well well planned many of
 
02:20:46.910 --> 02:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
the recommendations in that plan have
 
02:20:48.889 --> 02:20:48.899 align:start position:0%
not come to fruition I've been adopted
 
02:20:48.899 --> 02:20:50.510 align:start position:0%
not come to fruition I've been adopted
so

02:20:50.510 --> 02:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:53.809 --> 02:20:53.819 align:start position:0%
um I'm I think the plan could certainly
 
02:20:57.710 --> 02:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
uh stand updating
 
02:21:01.309 --> 02:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
um but uh many of it's concerned many of
 
02:21:04.969 --> 02:21:04.979 align:start position:0%
its uh analyzes and recommendations
 
02:21:08.330 --> 02:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
would still stand today follow up follow
 
02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
up thank you
 
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
um and do you know if money from the
 
02:21:13.849 --> 02:21:13.859 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill could cover a
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
project like this uh I don't know about
 
02:21:18.650 --> 02:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure bill but
 
02:21:18.660 --> 02:21:19.450 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure bill but
um

02:21:19.450 --> 02:21:19.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
the uh recent Ira I forget the term but
 
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
um uh EPA is uh considering that they're
 
02:21:30.650 --> 02:21:30.660 align:start position:0%
taking comment right now they received a
 
02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
significant amount of funding for
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas
 
02:21:38.030 --> 02:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
uh and climate planning efforts and uh
 
02:21:40.309 --> 02:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
um they are taking public comment on how
 
02:21:42.110 --> 02:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
to allocate those and specifically
 
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
whether to allocate uh certain of those
 
02:21:48.170 --> 02:21:48.180 align:start position:0%
funds to to States we are we have been
 
02:21:50.929 --> 02:21:50.939 align:start position:0%
active in that comment process and we
 
02:21:52.190 --> 02:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
expect to hear something in the next
 
02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
couple of months as to whether EPA
 
02:21:57.410 --> 02:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
funding may be may be available for this
 
02:21:59.870 --> 02:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
um this type of an effort but at this
 
02:22:01.429 --> 02:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
point in time we certainly are not
 
02:22:04.250 --> 02:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
secure in that thank you very much
 
02:22:06.610 --> 02:22:06.620 align:start position:0%
inflation reduction act I'm sorry
 
02:22:09.290 --> 02:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
02:22:11.150 --> 02:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:22:13.730 --> 02:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
your reoccurring appearance before this
 
02:22:13.740 --> 02:22:15.410 align:start position:0%
your reoccurring appearance before this
committee

02:22:15.410 --> 02:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:22:15.420 --> 02:22:16.250 align:start position:0%
committee
um

02:22:16.250 --> 02:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:18.530 --> 02:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
could you could you you talked you
 
02:22:20.110 --> 02:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about the the
 
02:22:23.210 --> 02:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
challenges the costs associated with
 
02:22:26.210 --> 02:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
climate change and and implementing a a
 
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:27.530 align:start position:0%
climate change and and implementing a a
plan

02:22:27.530 --> 02:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:22:29.889 --> 02:22:29.899 align:start position:0%
um you know enter a potentially in
 
02:22:32.750 --> 02:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
impact on energy costs can you talk a
 
02:22:34.990 --> 02:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
little bit about the the opportunities
 
02:22:37.730 --> 02:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
that addressing climate change can
 
02:22:40.190 --> 02:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
present to that presents to our state
 
02:22:42.770 --> 02:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
and our economy
 
02:22:45.469 --> 02:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
uh representative remember we're here to
 
02:22:47.690 --> 02:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
ask questions about the bill
 
02:22:50.030 --> 02:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
we're not here to solve climate change
 
02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
as a problem Mr chairman
 
02:22:57.230 --> 02:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm I'm I guess I'm I'm speaking
 
02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
to the letter that we received where
 
02:23:01.790 --> 02:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
there's a discussion of the costs of
 
02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
climate change but I think we we've
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
heard it from
 
02:23:08.150 --> 02:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
um Mr Fitzgerald that there are that
 
02:23:11.929 --> 02:23:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:14.090 --> 02:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
if you can answer that quickly uh
 
02:23:16.250 --> 02:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
certainly I'll allow it certainly uh the
 
02:23:17.990 --> 02:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
letter refers to economic impacts those
 
02:23:19.610 --> 02:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
impacts can be both positive and
 
02:23:23.809 --> 02:23:23.819 align:start position:0%
negative and in the 2009 climate plan we
 
02:23:26.990 --> 02:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
certainly did uh identify a very
 
02:23:29.210 --> 02:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
significant potential economic benefits
 
02:23:31.070 --> 02:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
and overall the benefits were greater
 
02:23:34.130 --> 02:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
than the uh than the potential costs
 
02:23:37.910 --> 02:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
um but uh I when I say economic impacts
 
02:23:39.590 --> 02:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
in the letter it does refer to both
 
02:23:42.410 --> 02:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
positive and negative
 
02:23:53.150 --> 02:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:56.929 --> 02:23:56.939 align:start position:0%
I met from 2009 and
 
02:23:58.250 --> 02:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
and there are pieces that were not
 
02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
implemented what could we do to
 
02:24:02.510 --> 02:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
implement those pieces other than you
 
02:24:04.070 --> 02:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
know this it sounds like really
 
02:24:05.690 --> 02:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
complicated and expensive two-year
 
02:24:07.730 --> 02:24:07.740 align:start position:0%
effort to do this bill what could we do
 
02:24:09.530 --> 02:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
instead to implement those pieces from
 
02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
2009 that haven't been implemented
 
02:24:14.990 --> 02:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
well the 2009 plan was adopted as a
 
02:24:17.090 --> 02:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
result of a climate change policy task
 
02:24:19.610 --> 02:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
force that was established by an
 
02:24:22.309 --> 02:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
executive order by Governor Lynch that
 
02:24:26.050 --> 02:24:26.060 align:start position:0%
task force gave no authority to to
 
02:24:28.670 --> 02:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
implement any actions
 
02:24:30.830 --> 02:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
um opposition has always been that that
 
02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
Authority would need to be author would
 
02:24:35.809 --> 02:24:35.819 align:start position:0%
need to be provided for and authorized
 
02:24:39.110 --> 02:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
by the legislature and for instance the
 
02:24:40.849 --> 02:24:40.859 align:start position:0%
regional greenhouse gas initiative our
 
02:24:42.410 --> 02:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
participation and continued
 
02:24:44.170 --> 02:24:44.180 align:start position:0%
participation in that
 
02:24:47.410 --> 02:24:47.420 align:start position:0%
was authorized by the legislature
 
02:24:49.969 --> 02:24:49.979 align:start position:0%
things such as the renewable portfolio
 
02:24:52.309 --> 02:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
standard other other Energy Efficiency
 
02:24:54.290 --> 02:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
measures Etc that have been adopted over
 
02:24:56.570 --> 02:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
time have all been authorized by the
 
02:24:58.910 --> 02:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
legislature and so as was discussed in
 
02:25:01.550 --> 02:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
the last bill on the site evaluation
 
02:25:04.370 --> 02:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
committee the legislature would need to
 
02:25:06.889 --> 02:25:06.899 align:start position:0%
provide specific authorization
 
02:25:10.370 --> 02:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh to the uh the department or other
 
02:25:12.590 --> 02:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
agencies whatever to implement specific
 
02:25:15.050 --> 02:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
portions of the plan that would
 
02:25:18.170 --> 02:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh that that plan had it was a plan but
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
it had no specific authorization to it
 
02:25:22.910 --> 02:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
um so so just so I understand this
 
02:25:26.630 --> 02:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
you're saying that we do need to do some
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
kind of legislation in order to
 
02:25:30.889 --> 02:25:30.899 align:start position:0%
implement those recommendations from the
 
02:25:33.950 --> 02:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
2009 plan is there something that you
 
02:25:35.809 --> 02:25:35.819 align:start position:0%
could tell us that would be less
 
02:25:39.469 --> 02:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
expensive or require less staff or
 
02:25:42.650 --> 02:25:42.660 align:start position:0%
um could could somehow pass what seems
 
02:25:44.750 --> 02:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
to be you know a serious concern about
 
02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:49.190 align:start position:0%
to be you know a serious concern about
cost

02:25:49.190 --> 02:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:51.650 --> 02:25:51.660 align:start position:0%
well again the staff that worked on that
 
02:25:53.570 --> 02:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
plan are no longer with the Department
 
02:25:57.530 --> 02:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
because that that funding was provided
 
02:26:02.570 --> 02:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
by a settlement of funds from EPA
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
so even if I wanted to do something
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
similar to what we did before I I can't
 
02:26:10.250 --> 02:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
I can't do that now
 
02:26:12.889 --> 02:26:12.899 align:start position:0%
because those staff are no longer with
 
02:26:16.809 --> 02:26:16.819 align:start position:0%
us and and that funding is is gone
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
I would have since 2009
 
02:26:24.050 --> 02:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of the this type of work that
 
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
we do has been funded by EPA but that
 
02:26:28.610 --> 02:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
work has been funded level funded since
 
02:26:33.410 --> 02:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
since uh 2010 and a grant that at one
 
02:26:35.870 --> 02:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
point from EPA covered approximately 21
 
02:26:40.370 --> 02:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
people today covers 12. so we our
 
02:26:43.309 --> 02:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
staffing is actually less than what it
 
02:26:45.889 --> 02:26:45.899 align:start position:0%
was at that time and
 
02:26:48.230 --> 02:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
the staff that were specifically funded
 
02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
to do this work are no longer with us
 
02:26:53.570 --> 02:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
and have no uh and there's and there's
 
02:26:56.270 --> 02:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
no funding for them even in the base EPA
 
02:26:58.670 --> 02:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
grants now again as was mentioned under
 
02:27:00.110 --> 02:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
the inflation reduction act there's
 
02:27:02.210 --> 02:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
potential federal funds
 
02:27:04.010 --> 02:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
um that would be available to states to
 
02:27:06.950 --> 02:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
to hire specific staff but I would be
 
02:27:08.809 --> 02:27:08.819 align:start position:0%
very hesitant to sit here and tell you
 
02:27:11.150 --> 02:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
that I could undertake
 
02:27:14.210 --> 02:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
even the most cursory climate action
 
02:27:16.250 --> 02:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
plan based on the current funding and
 
02:27:17.889 --> 02:27:17.899 align:start position:0%
resource situation within the department
 
02:27:20.630 --> 02:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Doug Thomas has
 
02:27:22.670 --> 02:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:27:24.590 --> 02:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question although I'm not
 
02:27:26.929 --> 02:27:26.939 align:start position:0%
sure a few answers but I would like to
 
02:27:29.809 --> 02:27:29.819 align:start position:0%
get back to the bill actually and in the
 
02:27:29.819 --> 02:27:30.650 align:start position:0%
get back to the bill actually and in the
bill

02:27:30.650 --> 02:27:30.660 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:27:33.710 --> 02:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
on the last page uh I think item number
 
02:27:37.070 --> 02:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
three it says State entry policy does it
 
02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
does this
 
02:27:40.730 --> 02:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
with this rewrite
 
02:27:44.330 --> 02:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
or cause to be Rewritten the the new uh
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
States 10-year energy plan that has just
 
02:27:49.370 --> 02:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
come out I'm a little confused as to
 
02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
what this would do and a doe it doesn't
 
02:27:53.929 --> 02:27:53.939 align:start position:0%
seem to be here so I'm wondering if you
 
02:27:56.510 --> 02:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
can comment on what that that paragraph
 
02:27:59.450 --> 02:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
on state energy policy would do
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
I don't have specifics for you but I do
 
02:28:04.429 --> 02:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
note that the bill says it shall repeal
 
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:10.969 --> 02:28:10.979 align:start position:0%
um and then and then that that section
 
02:28:14.450 --> 02:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
is then reenacted as follows and so
 
02:28:17.230 --> 02:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
this seems to me too in in legislation
 
02:28:21.170 --> 02:28:21.180 align:start position:0%
establish an energy policy policy then
 
02:28:22.730 --> 02:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
it would be up to the Department of
 
02:28:25.070 --> 02:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
energy to determine whether
 
02:28:27.530 --> 02:28:27.540 align:start position:0%
their current
 
02:28:30.290 --> 02:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
uh energy strategy
 
02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
um you know comports with the policy the
 
02:28:35.150 --> 02:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
legislatures to establish the policy
 
02:28:37.190 --> 02:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
then it would be up to the agency to
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not what they're
 
02:28:41.150 --> 02:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
doing is currently would comport with
 
02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
the revised policy follow up thank you
 
02:28:48.349 --> 02:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh so to to be clear then this would
 
02:28:52.130 --> 02:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
require the doe to do a review of their
 
02:28:54.969 --> 02:28:54.979 align:start position:0%
plan all over again to see if it met
 
02:28:57.530 --> 02:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
what the legislation here would would
 
02:28:59.270 --> 02:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
tell them to do well I would point out
 
02:29:00.889 --> 02:29:00.899 align:start position:0%
there are two separate plans one is a
 
02:29:03.050 --> 02:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
climate action plan that was the 2009
 
02:29:05.090 --> 02:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
the other is the state energy plan right
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
that is authorized currently authorized
 
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
in statute and I believe that the
 
02:29:10.730 --> 02:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
statute requires every three years that
 
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
it be updated
 
02:29:15.230 --> 02:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
um and uh but that's a task of the
 
02:29:18.230 --> 02:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
Department of energy we obviously can
 
02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
work with the Department of energy and
 
02:29:23.690 --> 02:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
try to achieve some consistency and and
 
02:29:26.809 --> 02:29:26.819 align:start position:0%
we we comment on their energy plan from
 
02:29:29.150 --> 02:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
an environmental perspective uh we don't
 
02:29:31.610 --> 02:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
comment on the on the energy policy from
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
a financial or or economic impact
 
02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:37.130 align:start position:0%
a financial or or economic impact
perspective

02:29:37.130 --> 02:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
02:29:39.770 --> 02:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr Fitzgerald we're going
 
02:29:41.990 --> 02:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
to move on here we have six people who
 
02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
would like to testify and we only have
 
02:29:46.849 --> 02:29:46.859 align:start position:0%
30 minutes left so
 
02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
um we will next call on Wharton Sinclair
 
02:29:57.410 --> 02:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
who is um from Sandwich New Hampshire to
 
02:30:01.610 --> 02:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
testify and Mr Sinkler you have three
 
02:30:04.130 --> 02:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you very much
 
02:30:07.010 --> 02:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
um yeah as the chair uh mentioned I'm
 
02:30:09.050 --> 02:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
from sandwich I'm here speaking on
 
02:30:13.490 --> 02:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
behalf of myself and I think it's I I am
 
02:30:16.130 --> 02:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill I think having a
 
02:30:20.450 --> 02:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
plan for uh addressing climate change is
 
02:30:22.670 --> 02:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
important uh one of the reasons is
 
02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:24.010 align:start position:0%
important uh one of the reasons is
economics

02:30:24.010 --> 02:30:24.020 align:start position:0%
economics
 
02:30:27.410 --> 02:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
we are seeing increasing disruption from
 
02:30:29.270 --> 02:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
climate change including economic
 
02:30:31.550 --> 02:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
effects in our state already any
 
02:30:33.889 --> 02:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
Industries which depend on snow and ice
 
02:30:37.790 --> 02:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
this winter have taken a big hit and I
 
02:30:39.650 --> 02:30:39.660 align:start position:0%
think there's a prognosis that that will
 
02:30:39.660 --> 02:30:40.809 align:start position:0%
think there's a prognosis that that will
continue

02:30:40.809 --> 02:30:40.819 align:start position:0%
continue
 
02:30:43.849 --> 02:30:43.859 align:start position:0%
as the disruptions become more severe
 
02:30:47.090 --> 02:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility that Draconian
 
02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
steps will be needed in the future and
 
02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
we can position New Hampshire uh better
 
02:30:55.910 --> 02:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
to uh to be in a better position when
 
02:30:58.610 --> 02:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
that happens if and when that happens if
 
02:31:01.790 --> 02:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
we have reduced our Reliance on fossil
 
02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
fuels in the interim so a plan for New
 
02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to do that to me is in line
 
02:31:11.150 --> 02:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
with economic prudence and responsible
 
02:31:14.870 --> 02:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
governance and I urge you to approve
 
02:31:17.450 --> 02:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
this plan and to take the
 
02:31:20.870 --> 02:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations that come with it and uh
 
02:31:24.950 --> 02:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
and act to reduce our greenhouse gas
 
02:31:27.650 --> 02:31:27.660 align:start position:0%
emissions which will reduce our
 
02:31:27.660 --> 02:31:29.170 align:start position:0%
emissions which will reduce our
vulnerability

02:31:29.170 --> 02:31:29.180 align:start position:0%
vulnerability
 
02:31:32.570 --> 02:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
with respect to a need to reduce those
 
02:31:35.929 --> 02:31:35.939 align:start position:0%
emissions there are other reasons that
 
02:31:38.929 --> 02:31:38.939 align:start position:0%
are for example health related a lot of
 
02:31:42.830 --> 02:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
bad health effects are due to emissions
 
02:31:46.429 --> 02:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
of uh from fossil fuels particulate
 
02:31:49.490 --> 02:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
emissions which cause really severe
 
02:31:52.070 --> 02:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
health effects severe heat which is
 
02:31:54.469 --> 02:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
really hard on our residents especially
 
02:31:57.650 --> 02:31:57.660 align:start position:0%
older people and children there are also
 
02:32:00.889 --> 02:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
National Security issues with our use of
 
02:32:04.190 --> 02:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels right now we are indirectly
 
02:32:08.030 --> 02:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
in a conflict with Russia and they
 
02:32:11.389 --> 02:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
benefit when uh are when we use a lot of
 
02:32:14.690 --> 02:32:14.700 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel and thereby keep the global
 
02:32:17.630 --> 02:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
price for fossil fuels high so from a
 
02:32:20.690 --> 02:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
national security point of view New
 
02:32:22.550 --> 02:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can do its part and really
 
02:32:25.490 --> 02:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
have an impact if we plan away from
 
02:32:28.370 --> 02:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
these fossil fuels will benefit the
 
02:32:30.170 --> 02:32:30.180 align:start position:0%
climate will benefit health will benefit
 
02:32:32.450 --> 02:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
National Security I would particularly
 
02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
urge the Republicans on the committee to
 
02:32:38.690 --> 02:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
take a stand here and do what I believe
 
02:32:41.150 --> 02:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
their constituents want of them which is
 
02:32:43.910 --> 02:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
to take this issue seriously and to make
 
02:32:47.389 --> 02:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
some substantive uh actions in the
 
02:32:51.050 --> 02:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
direction of a responsible and uh
 
02:32:54.830 --> 02:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
substantive uh set of actions to address
 
02:32:57.110 --> 02:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
address climate change thank you very
 
02:32:59.210 --> 02:32:59.220 align:start position:0%
much for your attention and I'd be happy
 
02:33:02.090 --> 02:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
to take any questions that you have
 
02:33:04.429 --> 02:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sinkler and thank you for
 
02:33:06.830 --> 02:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
being respectful of our time limit
 
02:33:14.330 --> 02:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:17.809 --> 02:33:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:19.790 --> 02:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Bose and thank you for
 
02:33:22.309 --> 02:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
your testimony Mr Sinkler can you just
 
02:33:23.809 --> 02:33:23.819 align:start position:0%
explain what some of the benefits would
 
02:33:25.849 --> 02:33:25.859 align:start position:0%
be if we were to adopt a climate action
 
02:33:27.290 --> 02:33:27.300 align:start position:0%
plan I've heard a lot of negative about
 
02:33:29.870 --> 02:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
cost and Staffing for Des and the fact
 
02:33:31.730 --> 02:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
that it's 14 euros old and hasn't been
 
02:33:33.590 --> 02:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
implemented what are some of the pros
 
02:33:36.830 --> 02:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
well it depends really what the actions
 
02:33:40.550 --> 02:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
recommended are but for example reducing
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know replacing the state vehicle
 
02:33:46.910 --> 02:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
fleet vehicles in the state vehicle
 
02:33:50.150 --> 02:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
Fleet and in Municipal uh vehicle fleets
 
02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
with electric vehicles may have uh real
 
02:33:58.130 --> 02:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
benefits they're cheaper to run you can
 
02:34:00.530 --> 02:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
charge them at night when most of the
 
02:34:02.929 --> 02:34:02.939 align:start position:0%
power is coming from Seabrook and we're
 
02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
not using natural gas which we don't
 
02:34:08.570 --> 02:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
produce anyway in our state uh you know
 
02:34:11.870 --> 02:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
so that is an economic benefit as well
 
02:34:16.490 --> 02:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
as having clean air and uh you know
 
02:34:19.010 --> 02:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
reduce reliance you know the National
 
02:34:21.349 --> 02:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
Security effects that I mentioned but
 
02:34:23.690 --> 02:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
yes I think there are there are there
 
02:34:25.370 --> 02:34:25.380 align:start position:0%
obviously it has to be part of the plan
 
02:34:28.010 --> 02:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
to analyze the economic effects of a
 
02:34:31.429 --> 02:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
initiative such as replacing vehicles uh
 
02:34:34.370 --> 02:34:34.380 align:start position:0%
in in fleets with electric vehicles
 
02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
um but that's a that's an example of the
 
02:34:39.290 --> 02:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
type of thing that we could be doing uh
 
02:34:42.110 --> 02:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
to and also installing more uh renewable
 
02:34:45.410 --> 02:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
energy working with our utilities and
 
02:34:47.150 --> 02:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission to
 
02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
encourage the uh implementation of work
 
02:34:51.969 --> 02:34:51.979 align:start position:0%
of more clean energy
 
02:34:55.190 --> 02:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
that is you know when it's produced here
 
02:34:59.150 --> 02:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it uh it's local it's
 
02:35:02.929 --> 02:35:02.939 align:start position:0%
uh clean it's economical uh so many many
 
02:35:05.630 --> 02:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
benefits including economical benefits
 
02:35:08.090 --> 02:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
thanks okay thank you
 
02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions from the
 
02:35:11.570 --> 02:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
committee I'd like to thank you for
 
02:35:13.309 --> 02:35:13.319 align:start position:0%
stopping by this morning and talking
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
with us thank you all very much and I'd
 
02:35:17.809 --> 02:35:17.819 align:start position:0%
like to call next
 
02:35:23.270 --> 02:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
on Joan Widner of Amherst
 
02:35:25.849 --> 02:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
who's representing herself and Miss
 
02:35:25.859 --> 02:35:27.290 align:start position:0%
who's representing herself and Miss
Whitmer

02:35:27.290 --> 02:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
Whitmer
 
02:35:30.590 --> 02:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
I think we've already heard about
 
02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
the need for this bill
 
02:35:36.349 --> 02:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
to address climate change so rather than
 
02:35:38.389 --> 02:35:38.399 align:start position:0%
restating that need if you could tell us
 
02:35:40.070 --> 02:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
how specifically you think this bill
 
02:35:43.250 --> 02:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
will will help we'd appreciate that well
 
02:35:45.290 --> 02:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
I've submitted some written testimony
 
02:35:47.090 --> 02:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
which is really addressing the health
 
02:35:50.330 --> 02:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
implications of climate change I'm a
 
02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
healthcare practitioner I'm a nurse
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
working for home health and hospice in
 
02:35:56.929 --> 02:35:56.939 align:start position:0%
Merrimack and I see every day patients
 
02:35:59.270 --> 02:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
that are dealing with exacerbations of
 
02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
COPD and congestive heart failure as a
 
02:36:06.349 --> 02:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
result of high heat index date days most
 
02:36:08.090 --> 02:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire homes are not equipped
 
02:36:09.770 --> 02:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
with air conditioning and so these
 
02:36:12.050 --> 02:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
patients suffer particularly badly we in
 
02:36:13.730 --> 02:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
fact at home health and hospice have a
 
02:36:15.410 --> 02:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
fan program where we'll bring a fan to a
 
02:36:16.849 --> 02:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
home of a patient that is having
 
02:36:19.250 --> 02:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
difficulty breathing but put that aside
 
02:36:20.929 --> 02:36:20.939 align:start position:0%
prior to becoming a nurse I had a
 
02:36:23.090 --> 02:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
25-year career in corporate finance and
 
02:36:27.230 --> 02:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
accounting and I spent years developing
 
02:36:29.870 --> 02:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
operational and business plans as well
 
02:36:32.090 --> 02:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
as strategic plans and as everyone knows
 
02:36:33.530 --> 02:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
a strategic plan needs to be updated
 
02:36:35.870 --> 02:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
dated every three years we're dealing
 
02:36:37.790 --> 02:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
with a climate change plan that was not
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
has not been updated since 2009 that's
 
02:36:43.370 --> 02:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
untenable because every plan needs to be
 
02:36:45.530 --> 02:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
modified over time because the events
 
02:36:47.270 --> 02:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
and circumstances around those plans
 
02:36:50.690 --> 02:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
change so it's just real Prudence to
 
02:36:53.570 --> 02:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
modify plans over time and to make sure
 
02:36:55.330 --> 02:36:55.340 align:start position:0%
that you're using the appropriate
 
02:36:58.150 --> 02:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that are that are available
 
02:37:01.849 --> 02:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
also I will Echo um my the prior
 
02:37:05.210 --> 02:37:05.220 align:start position:0%
individual's testimony that most climate
 
02:37:09.230 --> 02:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
change benefiting work is cost savings I
 
02:37:11.389 --> 02:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
personally drive a hybrid car and I get
 
02:37:13.670 --> 02:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
50 miles to the gallon I I'm looking
 
02:37:15.650 --> 02:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
forward to the next car purchase to go
 
02:37:18.650 --> 02:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
to full electric matter of fact a lot of
 
02:37:20.750 --> 02:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
electric companies are now doing Net
 
02:37:23.630 --> 02:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
Zero metering to allow individuals who
 
02:37:26.990 --> 02:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
own vehicles to charge them at off-peak
 
02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
hours so that they can then buy back
 
02:37:32.210 --> 02:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
that energy during peak hours that their
 
02:37:33.950 --> 02:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
batteries have that have not been used
 
02:37:35.870 --> 02:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of benefits solar
 
02:37:40.130 --> 02:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:42.050 --> 02:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
different kinds of light bulbs getting
 
02:37:44.150 --> 02:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
rid of the incandescence and going to
 
02:37:46.490 --> 02:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
the other kinds of both I can't think of
 
02:37:47.750 --> 02:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
their names I'm drawing a blank on it
 
02:37:49.849 --> 02:37:49.859 align:start position:0%
I'm not a technologist I'm a healthcare
 
02:37:52.969 --> 02:37:52.979 align:start position:0%
practitioner and I know that with the
 
02:37:55.610 --> 02:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
increase is in visits to the emergency
 
02:37:57.469 --> 02:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
department that's costing us through our
 
02:37:59.929 --> 02:37:59.939 align:start position:0%
Medicaid dollars because a lot of these
 
02:38:01.010 --> 02:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
patients are coming to the emergency
 
02:38:03.230 --> 02:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
room for treatment and so we have
 
02:38:05.750 --> 02:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
savings there so I mean I again this is
 
02:38:07.790 --> 02:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
all off the cuff based on my knowledge
 
02:38:10.450 --> 02:38:10.460 align:start position:0%
of both business finance and Health Care
 
02:38:13.070 --> 02:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time to speak I don't
 
02:38:15.469 --> 02:38:15.479 align:start position:0%
want to talk to specifics in the bills
 
02:38:18.110 --> 02:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
because that's not my area of expertise
 
02:38:22.309 --> 02:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:24.410 --> 02:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate you being
 
02:38:26.450 --> 02:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
here and being respectful of our time
 
02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
limitations thank you representative
 
02:38:31.250 --> 02:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you Mr chair
 
02:38:32.750 --> 02:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question just
 
02:38:35.630 --> 02:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
for clarification uh uh when you were
 
02:38:37.130 --> 02:38:37.140 align:start position:0%
introduced you said you were
 
02:38:39.349 --> 02:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
representing yourself I am on the
 
02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
written testimony though the The Heading
 
02:38:43.250 --> 02:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
says New Hampshire health care workers
 
02:38:44.750 --> 02:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
for climate action we're just a
 
02:38:47.330 --> 02:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
volunteer group I'm a volunteer I'm just
 
02:38:48.590 --> 02:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
a volunteer that happens to be
 
02:38:50.389 --> 02:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
affiliated with the organization it's a
 
02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's a non-profit group of of clinicians
 
02:38:56.690 --> 02:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
who get together and we we want to
 
02:38:58.550 --> 02:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
increase the voice of health care
 
02:39:00.770 --> 02:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
workers on climate change and the impact
 
02:39:03.290 --> 02:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
because While most people accept climate
 
02:39:05.630 --> 02:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
change is real they don't recognize that
 
02:39:08.090 --> 02:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
it's impacting them today it's impacting
 
02:39:09.710 --> 02:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
their health thank you for that
 
02:39:13.070 --> 02:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:16.309 --> 02:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
so to clarify representative Thomas's
 
02:39:19.190 --> 02:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
question do you represent this group New
 
02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no I just put it on their
 
02:39:22.429 --> 02:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
letterhead because I just wanted to
 
02:39:24.110 --> 02:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
promote the name of the organization
 
02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
because we're here and we will probably
 
02:39:28.670 --> 02:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
be talking not just me but other people
 
02:39:31.070 --> 02:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
we're just volunteers we're no one's
 
02:39:33.530 --> 02:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
paid so I don't think in representing
 
02:39:35.270 --> 02:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
the group I'm speaking as an individual
 
02:39:37.010 --> 02:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
certainly my business background has
 
02:39:38.570 --> 02:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the organization it's
 
02:39:41.270 --> 02:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
just I'm a unique in healthcare workers
 
02:39:43.490 --> 02:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
to have both backgrounds great thank you
 
02:39:45.130 --> 02:39:45.140 align:start position:0%
for that clarification certainly
 
02:39:47.870 --> 02:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
02:39:49.550 --> 02:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:39:50.929 --> 02:39:50.939 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
um based on your on your on your
 
02:39:55.309 --> 02:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
business experience
 
02:39:57.530 --> 02:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
um would would you agree or not agree
 
02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
that you know one of the things that
 
02:40:02.030 --> 02:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
really determines whether businesses are
 
02:40:05.630 --> 02:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
going to invest in anything a project or
 
02:40:08.690 --> 02:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
or a business
 
02:40:12.590 --> 02:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
um really is is driven in law in in in
 
02:40:16.190 --> 02:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
in in a large part by their
 
02:40:19.010 --> 02:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
understanding of kind of the economic
 
02:40:20.990 --> 02:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
um you know environment absolutely
 
02:40:22.730 --> 02:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot of businesses make
 
02:40:24.650 --> 02:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
most of their financial decisions based
 
02:40:26.270 --> 02:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
on short-term issues but we're seeing
 
02:40:28.490 --> 02:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
that change over time because long-term
 
02:40:30.050 --> 02:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
issues are having a greater impact over
 
02:40:32.570 --> 02:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
time for instance increase in cost in
 
02:40:34.429 --> 02:40:34.439 align:start position:0%
health care is impacting
 
02:40:36.889 --> 02:40:36.899 align:start position:0%
um will eventually impact if it hasn't
 
02:40:38.389 --> 02:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
already I don't have the data in front
 
02:40:40.190 --> 02:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
of me um Healthcare premium so that's
 
02:40:41.750 --> 02:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
going to affect everyone it's going to
 
02:40:43.550 --> 02:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
affect businesses
 
02:40:45.770 --> 02:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
um there are a lot of issues and so you
 
02:40:48.469 --> 02:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
have to make business decisions not only
 
02:40:50.990 --> 02:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
based on short-term issues which is what
 
02:40:52.969 --> 02:40:52.979 align:start position:0%
a business or an operation plan does but
 
02:40:54.469 --> 02:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
also on long-term issues which is what
 
02:40:57.050 --> 02:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
is strategic plan does and I liken this
 
02:40:59.570 --> 02:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
plan to a strategic plan it looks at the
 
02:41:01.010 --> 02:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
longer term picture and if we don't
 
02:41:04.429 --> 02:41:04.439 align:start position:0%
start investing now as Mr Wharton uh I
 
02:41:05.929 --> 02:41:05.939 align:start position:0%
didn't catch his last name Morton said
 
02:41:08.030 --> 02:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
previously we're going to pay later
 
02:41:10.190 --> 02:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
because the cost of mitigation is going
 
02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
to be less in the near term than it will
 
02:41:14.210 --> 02:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
be in the long term and we will be
 
02:41:17.270 --> 02:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
seeing increased adverse weather events
 
02:41:20.210 --> 02:41:20.220 align:start position:0%
it's it's 98 of the world scientists on
 
02:41:22.250 --> 02:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
this agree on this fact
 
02:41:24.830 --> 02:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
follow up just a quick follow-up so so
 
02:41:28.070 --> 02:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
my my my point was that
 
02:41:31.309 --> 02:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
um that this plan if if this plan if
 
02:41:33.349 --> 02:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
this bill passed and if a climate action
 
02:41:35.809 --> 02:41:35.819 align:start position:0%
plan was implemented
 
02:41:39.230 --> 02:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
um would that not provide some better
 
02:41:41.389 --> 02:41:41.399 align:start position:0%
Clarity to businesses that are thinking
 
02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
about potentially investing in
 
02:41:46.910 --> 02:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
um Alternative Energy Products
 
02:41:49.370 --> 02:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
absolutely I mean and therefore you know
 
02:41:51.290 --> 02:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
help generate that economic activity
 
02:41:53.450 --> 02:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
that we've talked about I I completely
 
02:41:55.910 --> 02:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
concur with that I think that if if
 
02:41:57.710 --> 02:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
um the the state is moving in that
 
02:41:59.210 --> 02:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
direction then businesses are going to
 
02:42:01.010 --> 02:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
be prudent to do the same because don't
 
02:42:02.809 --> 02:42:02.819 align:start position:0%
forget consumers are starting to demand
 
02:42:04.610 --> 02:42:04.620 align:start position:0%
this there are investment funds out
 
02:42:06.110 --> 02:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
there now that are looking at social
 
02:42:08.270 --> 02:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
issues in terms of making Investments
 
02:42:10.849 --> 02:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
and so some individuals who are taking
 
02:42:13.010 --> 02:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
their hard-earned dollars to invest are
 
02:42:15.469 --> 02:42:15.479 align:start position:0%
looking to invest in companies that have
 
02:42:18.770 --> 02:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
a a positive perspective relative to
 
02:42:20.270 --> 02:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
climate change and want to make an
 
02:42:22.190 --> 02:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
impact on that so that is becoming an
 
02:42:24.650 --> 02:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
issue and the consumer is making that an
 
02:42:27.410 --> 02:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
issue thank you
 
02:42:29.330 --> 02:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
okay thank you seeing no further
 
02:42:30.889 --> 02:42:30.899 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your time we
 
02:42:33.469 --> 02:42:33.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate your being here

um I'd also like to express my thanks to
 
02:42:59.690 --> 02:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
uh representative sellaway of Grafton
 
02:43:01.670 --> 02:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
and Mr Sinkler and Ms Whitmer for
 
02:43:04.010 --> 02:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
speaking about some of the challenges
 
02:43:06.170 --> 02:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
that my region of New Hampshire faces as
 
02:43:09.650 --> 02:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
well House Bill 208 provides climate
 
02:43:11.450 --> 02:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
planning with an eye towards addressing
 
02:43:13.450 --> 02:43:13.460 align:start position:0%
long-range economic
 
02:43:15.830 --> 02:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
and environmental benefits those
 
02:43:19.429 --> 02:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
economic benefits include tourism and
 
02:43:21.530 --> 02:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
Forestry and quality of life things are
 
02:43:23.510 --> 02:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
there that are especially important in
 
02:43:26.809 --> 02:43:26.819 align:start position:0%
our sort of North Central uh part of New
 
02:43:29.590 --> 02:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so why does New Hampshire need
 
02:43:35.030 --> 02:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
a plan uh that HB 208 puts forward well
 
02:43:37.969 --> 02:43:37.979 align:start position:0%
our current 10-year plan is a plan that
 
02:43:40.490 --> 02:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
maintains the fossil fuel status quo and
 
02:43:43.849 --> 02:43:43.859 align:start position:0%
this accelerates uh the deleterious
 
02:43:46.070 --> 02:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
economic effects in the portion of State
 
02:43:48.530 --> 02:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
that's the economic engine for tourism
 
02:43:52.130 --> 02:43:52.140 align:start position:0%
and Forestry the the part of the state
 
02:43:55.190 --> 02:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:57.650 --> 02:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
there's another aspect to this you know
 
02:43:59.090 --> 02:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
recently I spent part of my Tuesday
 
02:44:00.590 --> 02:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
morning reading aloud to 18
 
02:44:02.750 --> 02:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
four-year-old preschoolers children's
 
02:44:05.690 --> 02:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
stories about empathy generosity and the
 
02:44:07.370 --> 02:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
personal courage to do what's right
 
02:44:10.250 --> 02:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
let's talk about HB 208 in the context
 
02:44:12.349 --> 02:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
of generosity and the personal courage
 
02:44:14.530 --> 02:44:14.540 align:start position:0%
to do what's right
 
02:44:17.030 --> 02:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
there's an ideological school of thought
 
02:44:19.130 --> 02:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
called Austrian capitalism measures all
 
02:44:21.429 --> 02:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
values and benefits in terms of dollars
 
02:44:23.450 --> 02:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
proponents would say that the economic
 
02:44:26.389 --> 02:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
value of the status quo outweighs any
 
02:44:28.490 --> 02:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
future intangible benefits
 
02:44:31.250 --> 02:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
if you believe that so what cash value
 
02:44:33.349 --> 02:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
would you put on our grandchildren's
 
02:44:35.870 --> 02:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
quality of life
 
02:44:37.130 --> 02:44:37.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of
 
02:44:39.290 --> 02:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services projects that by
 
02:44:41.690 --> 02:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
the time those four-year-olds reach my
 
02:44:43.490 --> 02:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
age the climate of New Hampshire will
 
02:44:45.710 --> 02:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
have changed to resemble that of North
 
02:44:47.150 --> 02:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
Carolina today
 
02:44:49.969 --> 02:44:49.979 align:start position:0%
those kids will say too bad our native
 
02:44:52.429 --> 02:44:52.439 align:start position:0%
species were not resilient enough those
 
02:44:54.710 --> 02:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
Carolina species don't grow to maturity
 
02:44:56.570 --> 02:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
spawn and reseed fast enough to escape
 
02:44:59.809 --> 02:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
the new to New Hampshire 800 miles north
 
02:45:01.730 --> 02:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
in just 60 years
 
02:45:04.130 --> 02:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
there will be a disaster there will be
 
02:45:04.140 --> 02:45:05.750 align:start position:0%
there will be a disaster there will be
extinctions

02:45:05.750 --> 02:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
extinctions
 
02:45:07.370 --> 02:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
those kids will blame the Boomers
 
02:45:08.870 --> 02:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
they'll blame the government they'll
 
02:45:10.910 --> 02:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
look at your voting record they'll blame
 
02:45:10.920 --> 02:45:11.809 align:start position:0%
look at your voting record they'll blame
you

02:45:11.809 --> 02:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:45:14.210 --> 02:45:14.220 align:start position:0%
do you want that to be your legacy
 
02:45:16.010 --> 02:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
show us that you learned the lessons
 
02:45:17.809 --> 02:45:17.819 align:start position:0%
about generosity and personal courage
 
02:45:19.750 --> 02:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
that we try to teach to four-year-olds
 
02:45:23.210 --> 02:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
representative in contrast to yes can I
 
02:45:25.250 --> 02:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
interrupt you for just a second and ask
 
02:45:28.130 --> 02:45:28.140 align:start position:0%
you to speak specifically to how the
 
02:45:28.140 --> 02:45:29.090 align:start position:0%
you to speak specifically to how the
bill

02:45:29.090 --> 02:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
will address the issues that you're
 
02:45:34.910 --> 02:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
talking about for example you've just
 
02:45:38.690 --> 02:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
stated in in your testimony that
 
02:45:41.270 --> 02:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's climate in some number
 
02:45:42.889 --> 02:45:42.899 align:start position:0%
of years from now will be like North
 
02:45:45.290 --> 02:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
Carolina's well that's a prediction
 
02:45:45.300 --> 02:45:47.030 align:start position:0%
Carolina's well that's a prediction
but

02:45:47.030 --> 02:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:45:48.770 --> 02:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
most of the predictions that have been
 
02:45:51.410 --> 02:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
made about climate change in the last
 
02:45:54.050 --> 02:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
30 40 years have proved to be incorrect
 
02:45:56.510 --> 02:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that so so why don't you
 
02:45:59.290 --> 02:45:59.300 align:start position:0%
try to explain to us how this bill
 
02:46:01.610 --> 02:46:01.620 align:start position:0%
addresses the goals that you want to
 
02:46:05.349 --> 02:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
achieve specifically on the last page
 
02:46:09.469 --> 02:46:09.479 align:start position:0%
talking about lines 11 and 12 achieving
 
02:46:10.969 --> 02:46:10.979 align:start position:0%
the greenhouse gas emission goals
 
02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
identified in RSA 125 and protect the
 
02:46:15.650 --> 02:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
safety and health of the citizens the
 
02:46:17.210 --> 02:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
physical environment of the state the
 
02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
supply of Natural Resources for future
 
02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:20.530 align:start position:0%
supply of Natural Resources for future
Generations

02:46:20.530 --> 02:46:20.540 align:start position:0%
Generations
 
02:46:22.849 --> 02:46:22.859 align:start position:0%
representative soloway talked about the
 
02:46:24.889 --> 02:46:24.899 align:start position:0%
ticks and the and the the moose
 
02:46:26.809 --> 02:46:26.819 align:start position:0%
population about the impacts the
 
02:46:29.330 --> 02:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
negative impacts on tourist Industries
 
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
like skiing and foliage and things like
 
02:46:34.849 --> 02:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
that we are already seeing the economic
 
02:46:37.969 --> 02:46:37.979 align:start position:0%
impacts the the that are damaging uh New
 
02:46:39.490 --> 02:46:39.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy
 
02:46:42.530 --> 02:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
so we need an energy policy that that
 
02:46:44.929 --> 02:46:44.939 align:start position:0%
needs to be developed in regard to the
 
02:46:47.990 --> 02:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
short and long-term uh financial and
 
02:46:51.349 --> 02:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal UH responsibilities that we have
 
02:46:55.969 --> 02:46:55.979 align:start position:0%
we can't just look at the short term
 
02:46:55.979 --> 02:46:57.170 align:start position:0%
we can't just look at the short term
uh

02:46:57.170 --> 02:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:47:00.110 --> 02:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
aspect of what it's going to cost us
 
02:47:03.349 --> 02:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
today as opposed to doing nothing so I
 
02:47:06.410 --> 02:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
think that we'll need to we need to have
 
02:47:09.950 --> 02:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
a plan I think that house bill 208 is a
 
02:47:11.570 --> 02:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
good step in the direction of
 
02:47:14.210 --> 02:47:14.220 align:start position:0%
establishing a plan and a mechanism for
 
02:47:14.220 --> 02:47:14.750 align:start position:0%
establishing a plan and a mechanism for
um

02:47:14.750 --> 02:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:16.510 --> 02:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
making sure that
 
02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
we are we the state of New Hampshire are
 
02:47:22.010 --> 02:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
not a laggard behind the other New
 
02:47:25.309 --> 02:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
England states whose uh whose plans
 
02:47:28.490 --> 02:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
include uh things to control greenhouse
 
02:47:31.250 --> 02:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
gas emissions you know we are we are
 
02:47:33.830 --> 02:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
running out of Runway so fast that ideas
 
02:47:36.670 --> 02:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
of of you know some someday Technologies
 
02:47:41.210 --> 02:47:41.220 align:start position:0%
uh that will save us are um are things
 
02:47:43.010 --> 02:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
that don't meaningfully exist in reality
 
02:47:45.170 --> 02:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
any more than perpetual motion does and
 
02:47:46.730 --> 02:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
at this very moment we're hurtling down
 
02:47:48.530 --> 02:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
a dead end runway on a flightless school
 
02:47:50.570 --> 02:47:50.580 align:start position:0%
bus and on board are not just our
 
02:47:53.030 --> 02:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
children but every every species on the
 
02:47:55.610 --> 02:47:55.620 align:start position:0%
planet the status quo is no longer a
 
02:47:57.950 --> 02:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
good option we need a plan and that plan
 
02:48:00.770 --> 02:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
needs to agree uh it has to have an
 
02:48:02.330 --> 02:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
agreement to get our foot off the
 
02:48:04.910 --> 02:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
accelerator thank you very much
 
02:48:08.389 --> 02:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you appreciate that do we
 
02:48:09.650 --> 02:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
have any questions representative
 
02:48:12.110 --> 02:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
Bernardi has a question
 
02:48:17.030 --> 02:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so uh Mr Wells
 
02:48:20.929 --> 02:48:20.939 align:start position:0%
you've gone over a bunch of potential
 
02:48:24.230 --> 02:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
benefits but you've gone over no cost to
 
02:48:27.349 --> 02:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
this what are the costs of this plan
 
02:48:31.130 --> 02:48:31.140 align:start position:0%
I think that um uh Mr Fitzgerald talked
 
02:48:33.650 --> 02:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
about what the Staffing costs would be
 
02:48:36.889 --> 02:48:36.899 align:start position:0%
and until we have a plan uh I don't
 
02:48:38.990 --> 02:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
think I could predict what those costs
 
02:48:41.389 --> 02:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
uh would be but I know what the cost
 
02:48:43.910 --> 02:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
will be if we do nothing things will
 
02:48:47.870 --> 02:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:53.690 --> 02:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:56.630 --> 02:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
so if you were building a house and you
 
02:48:59.929 --> 02:48:59.939 align:start position:0%
went to the Builder and you said uh
 
02:49:03.050 --> 02:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
please craft a plan for me to build this
 
02:49:03.060 --> 02:49:04.190 align:start position:0%
please craft a plan for me to build this
house

02:49:04.190 --> 02:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:49:06.170 --> 02:49:06.180 align:start position:0%
would you not tell him
 
02:49:07.849 --> 02:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
what you are
 
02:49:10.849 --> 02:49:10.859 align:start position:0%
your budget for the house was
 
02:49:12.590 --> 02:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
would you not give him some indication
 
02:49:14.630 --> 02:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
about how much money you could afford to
 
02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:17.090 align:start position:0%
about how much money you could afford to
spend

02:49:17.090 --> 02:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:19.070 --> 02:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
that budget would also have to include
 
02:49:22.010 --> 02:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
what um what the performance of the
 
02:49:25.370 --> 02:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
house should be like in the future and I
 
02:49:28.250 --> 02:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
would uh you know I would budget so that
 
02:49:30.110 --> 02:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
things like insulation to save energy
 
02:49:33.530 --> 02:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
would be included in that and not simply
 
02:49:36.590 --> 02:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
try to build uh some some box that has
 
02:49:38.510 --> 02:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
the the maximum of square footage for
 
02:49:40.370 --> 02:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
the the cheapest cost so I don't think
 
02:49:42.469 --> 02:49:42.479 align:start position:0%
that's up to the Builder to determine
 
02:49:44.150 --> 02:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
that that's up to the planner which
 
02:49:46.550 --> 02:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
would be me the owner of the the house
 
02:49:50.450 --> 02:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
we are the uh as well you as policy
 
02:49:52.969 --> 02:49:52.979 align:start position:0%
makers uh own that decision
 
02:49:55.790 --> 02:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
and you should have a way of planning
 
02:49:57.349 --> 02:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
the future and not just continue with
 
02:49:59.090 --> 02:49:59.100 align:start position:0%
the status quo because that's the the
 
02:50:02.389 --> 02:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
path of least resistance
 
02:50:04.429 --> 02:50:04.439 align:start position:0%
so you'd be comfortable with a plan that
 
02:50:06.830 --> 02:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
had I'm sorry you'd be comfortable with
 
02:50:08.630 --> 02:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
a plan that had an open-ended cost
 
02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:12.530 align:start position:0%
a plan that had an open-ended cost
structure

02:50:12.530 --> 02:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:16.670 --> 02:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
Bill calls for uh calls for a mechanism
 
02:50:19.969 --> 02:50:19.979 align:start position:0%
for establishing a plan it doesn't uh it
 
02:50:23.510 --> 02:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
does not uh establish the expended any
 
02:50:25.550 --> 02:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
sort of things about expenditures in
 
02:50:27.349 --> 02:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
order to I don't know uh you know build
 
02:50:30.170 --> 02:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
nuclear reactors or or uh or you know
 
02:50:33.969 --> 02:50:33.979 align:start position:0%
windmills or what have you to reduce
 
02:50:37.730 --> 02:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases but but this bill talks
 
02:50:40.610 --> 02:50:40.620 align:start position:0%
about establishing a mechanism for
 
02:50:43.190 --> 02:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
making that plan so it's like engaging
 
02:50:46.490 --> 02:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
the architect not building the house
 
02:50:49.190 --> 02:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Summers
 
02:50:50.450 --> 02:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
02:50:51.830 --> 02:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just a quick
 
02:50:53.750 --> 02:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
question here um
 
02:50:56.389 --> 02:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
knowing our Uh current electrical grid
 
02:50:58.010 --> 02:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
the way it's powered the way it's
 
02:51:00.410 --> 02:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
generated the power is generated
 
02:51:02.150 --> 02:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
um how do you propose that we're going
 
02:51:05.090 --> 02:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
to lower 20 in the next two years well
 
02:51:07.550 --> 02:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
that's actually less than two years
 
02:51:09.170 --> 02:51:09.180 align:start position:0%
um I think that you've answered the
 
02:51:09.180 --> 02:51:10.010 align:start position:0%
um I think that you've answered the
question

02:51:10.010 --> 02:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:51:11.630 --> 02:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
um the the way that our grid is
 
02:51:15.230 --> 02:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
currently powered uh will have to change
 
02:51:16.790 --> 02:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
within two years
 
02:51:19.250 --> 02:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
uh it could it I don't know where you
 
02:51:22.070 --> 02:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
get two years uh in in the bill in the
 
02:51:25.190 --> 02:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
bill it's actually States 1A at least 20
 
02:51:29.150 --> 02:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
percent below 1990 level by 2025 which
 
02:51:33.770 --> 02:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:38.210 --> 02:51:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:40.849 --> 02:51:40.859 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh yes um sounds a bit what you're
 
02:51:45.469 --> 02:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
talking about is let me just make sure I
 
02:51:47.929 --> 02:51:47.939 align:start position:0%
get this correct a drastic change in the
 
02:51:49.730 --> 02:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
method of producing electricity if we're
 
02:51:51.590 --> 02:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
going to reduce those greenhouse gases
 
02:51:55.070 --> 02:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
by 20 we're going to see a uh not only a
 
02:51:56.570 --> 02:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have days like we did
 
02:51:58.550 --> 02:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
in January where 40 of our electricity
 
02:52:00.650 --> 02:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
was coming from oil uh we're not going
 
02:52:02.450 --> 02:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
to have an average day where 60 is
 
02:52:04.250 --> 02:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
coming from natural gas
 
02:52:05.690 --> 02:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna have to replace them with
 
02:52:07.490 --> 02:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
I would think solar and wind would be
 
02:52:09.230 --> 02:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
the two major options since we
 
02:52:10.070 --> 02:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
apparently don't want to build
 
02:52:12.769 --> 02:52:12.779 align:start position:0%
transmission lines from Canada either
 
02:52:15.769 --> 02:52:15.779 align:start position:0%
um what do you see as the pushback from
 
02:52:18.349 --> 02:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
people on say if you want to replace a
 
02:52:21.830 --> 02:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
600 megawatt gas plant you need about 20
 
02:52:25.309 --> 02:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
000 Acres of solar panels what's what 20
 
02:52:26.990 --> 02:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
000 acres is available in New England to
 
02:52:28.790 --> 02:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
build solar panels on and where are we
 
02:52:30.230 --> 02:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
going to put up hundreds and hundreds
 
02:52:32.150 --> 02:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
and hundreds of windmills without people
 
02:52:34.070 --> 02:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
saying I don't want it near me because
 
02:52:35.929 --> 02:52:35.939 align:start position:0%
it seems like wherever you propose it no
 
02:52:37.969 --> 02:52:37.979 align:start position:0%
one wants it so
 
02:52:40.490 --> 02:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
you know the the uh the acreage of of
 
02:52:43.130 --> 02:52:43.140 align:start position:0%
solar power to to produce 100 of the
 
02:52:45.710 --> 02:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
electricity that uh uh the state would
 
02:52:47.870 --> 02:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
require is less than the acreage used
 
02:52:50.090 --> 02:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
for baseball fields it's not as far as
 
02:52:52.309 --> 02:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
the eye can see as what you're sounding
 
02:52:54.230 --> 02:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
like you're imagining you know it's less
 
02:52:56.809 --> 02:52:56.819 align:start position:0%
than the rooftops of single wide motor
 
02:52:59.510 --> 02:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
homes in New Hampshire so you know it's
 
02:53:02.750 --> 02:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's an attainable goal
 
02:53:04.670 --> 02:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
um and I think that there are ways this
 
02:53:06.410 --> 02:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
bill talks about
 
02:53:09.050 --> 02:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
um uh removing some of the impediments
 
02:53:13.250 --> 02:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
to um to building uh cleaner uh energy
 
02:53:15.349 --> 02:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure you know for example one
 
02:53:16.849 --> 02:53:16.859 align:start position:0%
of the the things that I think that this
 
02:53:21.530 --> 02:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
plan uh might uh uh support would be um
 
02:53:24.170 --> 02:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
the the removal of the one megawatt uh
 
02:53:27.590 --> 02:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
cap on the size of uh uh solar
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
installations you know much as the
 
02:53:31.550 --> 02:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
community power has increased it to five
 
02:53:32.990 --> 02:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
megawatts it would make it a much more
 
02:53:36.710 --> 02:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh economically grid of feasible grid
 
02:53:37.910 --> 02:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
scale thing but this is getting way out
 
02:53:40.910 --> 02:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
head of what this bill talks about this
 
02:53:43.969 --> 02:53:43.979 align:start position:0%
bill talks about creating the the
 
02:53:46.130 --> 02:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
mechanism for planning for the future
 
02:53:50.450 --> 02:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:52.010 --> 02:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
you need a follow-up representative
 
02:53:53.450 --> 02:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
Harrington also
 
02:53:55.490 --> 02:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
02:53:57.650 --> 02:53:57.660 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
02:54:00.170 --> 02:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
um I'm referring to page one lines eight
 
02:54:02.210 --> 02:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
through ten where it says New Hampshire
 
02:54:03.650 --> 02:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
will see longer and hotter summer
 
02:54:06.110 --> 02:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
shorter warmer Winters and more frequent
 
02:54:08.349 --> 02:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
and more extreme precipitation events
 
02:54:11.269 --> 02:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
Revolt resulting in both increased
 
02:54:14.690 --> 02:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
flooding and drought in New Hampshire we
 
02:54:17.330 --> 02:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
build our houses with wood would
 
02:54:19.849 --> 02:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
obviously if it's exposed to a lot of
 
02:54:22.429 --> 02:54:22.439 align:start position:0%
moisture is going to rot we're also
 
02:54:24.650 --> 02:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
really bad at insulation so there's a
 
02:54:26.929 --> 02:54:26.939 align:start position:0%
lot of leaking I'm wondering energy
 
02:54:29.630 --> 02:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
leaking I'm wondering if you could speak
 
02:54:32.330 --> 02:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
to the economic impact of climate change
 
02:54:34.969 --> 02:54:34.979 align:start position:0%
on property value
 
02:54:38.150 --> 02:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
well uh yes I can speak a little bit
 
02:54:40.969 --> 02:54:40.979 align:start position:0%
about I'm not an expert in uh in real
 
02:54:42.650 --> 02:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
estate but the
 
02:54:45.530 --> 02:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
um the the longer hotter Summers the uh
 
02:54:48.530 --> 02:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
uh are uh increasing the
 
02:54:52.190 --> 02:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
um the uh likelihood of fire
 
02:54:54.650 --> 02:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
um which in our heavily wooded part of
 
02:54:57.590 --> 02:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire is is a real concern
 
02:55:02.210 --> 02:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
um and uh uh you know the the
 
02:55:02.220 --> 02:55:03.349 align:start position:0%
um and uh uh you know the the
um

02:55:03.349 --> 02:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:07.010 --> 02:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
the amount of of uh uh you know rainfall
 
02:55:09.170 --> 02:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
and things like that I think are are uh
 
02:55:10.730 --> 02:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
really impacting
 
02:55:13.910 --> 02:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
um uh homeowners that uh need to go out
 
02:55:16.849 --> 02:55:16.859 align:start position:0%
and expend a serious amount of money to
 
02:55:19.250 --> 02:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
drill a well because their their shallow
 
02:55:21.410 --> 02:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
Wells have gone dried these are shallow
 
02:55:23.450 --> 02:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
Wells that in my neighborhood some of
 
02:55:25.190 --> 02:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
those are a hundred years old and have
 
02:55:28.250 --> 02:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
been have been fine up until now
 
02:55:30.469 --> 02:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
um and so you know I think that that
 
02:55:32.510 --> 02:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
um you know there are real estate is
 
02:55:33.590 --> 02:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
very complicated there are other other
 
02:55:35.929 --> 02:55:35.939 align:start position:0%
pressures of course uh on that but but I
 
02:55:38.510 --> 02:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
think that that climate change uh is is
 
02:55:40.429 --> 02:55:40.439 align:start position:0%
going to impact the sorts of things that
 
02:55:43.010 --> 02:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
uh that make New Hampshire quality of
 
02:55:46.010 --> 02:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
life very good make uh New Hampshire a
 
02:55:48.050 --> 02:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
tourist destination and make New
 
02:55:49.130 --> 02:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a place that people want to
 
02:55:50.630 --> 02:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
buy homes and that'll have the largest
 
02:55:53.030 --> 02:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
impact I think on values of properties
 
02:55:55.849 --> 02:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you representative
 
02:55:59.570 --> 02:55:59.580 align:start position:0%
or former representative Wells for being
 
02:56:00.830 --> 02:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
here today we're going to have to move
 
02:56:02.450 --> 02:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
on because we have three more people who
 
02:56:04.370 --> 02:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
would like to testify and I'll Now call
 
02:56:08.090 --> 02:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
on Joseph quasnick to testify uh on
 
02:56:09.950 --> 02:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
behalf of himself
 
02:56:12.410 --> 02:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know if he will be testifying on
 
02:56:15.230 --> 02:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
behalf of represent organizations he
 
02:56:18.050 --> 02:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
represents or just for himself I plan to
 
02:56:21.110 --> 02:56:21.120 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman in this committee thank you
 
02:56:32.150 --> 02:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
for allowing me the time to testify
 
02:56:34.010 --> 02:56:34.020 align:start position:0%

02:56:34.020 --> 02:56:35.210 align:start position:0%
before you today

02:56:35.210 --> 02:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:38.269 --> 02:56:38.279 align:start position:0%
three minutes please three minutes thank
 
02:56:39.530 --> 02:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
02:56:41.210 --> 02:56:41.220 align:start position:0%
um just to give you a little bit about
 
02:56:42.950 --> 02:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
my background I've worked in the area of
 
02:56:44.630 --> 02:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
energy and environment for over 40 years
 
02:56:46.550 --> 02:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
beginning as the vice president of
 
02:56:48.769 --> 02:56:48.779 align:start position:0%
environment and climate change uh for
 
02:56:51.530 --> 02:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
National Grid I've spent nine years on
 
02:56:53.090 --> 02:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Electric Co-op board
 
02:56:56.269 --> 02:56:56.279 align:start position:0%
three of those years as chairman and
 
02:56:58.309 --> 02:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
I've also spent five years as a senior
 
02:57:00.590 --> 02:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
energy advisor at series Incorporated in
 
02:57:02.630 --> 02:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
Boston currently I'm a member of the
 
02:57:04.070 --> 02:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
management team of the New Hampshire
 
02:57:05.929 --> 02:57:05.939 align:start position:0%
Network for climate energy and
 
02:57:05.939 --> 02:57:07.070 align:start position:0%
Network for climate energy and
environment

02:57:07.070 --> 02:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
environment
 
02:57:10.610 --> 02:57:10.620 align:start position:0%
I'll keep this short I support this bill
 
02:57:13.070 --> 02:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
because one New Hampshire faces an
 
02:57:15.590 --> 02:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
existential threat to the economy and
 
02:57:18.410 --> 02:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
environmental future from global climate
 
02:57:20.389 --> 02:57:20.399 align:start position:0%
change in this bill provides a path for
 
02:57:23.030 --> 02:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
the state to rationally and economically
 
02:57:25.910 --> 02:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
begin to address that challenge
 
02:57:28.070 --> 02:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
in July 2022 the New Hampshire
 
02:57:29.750 --> 02:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
Department of energy released its
 
02:57:32.389 --> 02:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
long-awaited state energy strategy
 
02:57:34.130 --> 02:57:34.140 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the strategy is not
 
02:57:37.070 --> 02:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
actionable as all of the existed goals I
 
02:57:39.110 --> 02:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
think there are 10 goals fail to provide
 
02:57:40.910 --> 02:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
any metrics by which the department or
 
02:57:43.010 --> 02:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
the public can achieve can determine
 
02:57:45.170 --> 02:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
achievement of the goals and the
 
02:57:47.510 --> 02:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
strategy barely mentions climate change
 
02:57:49.849 --> 02:57:49.859 align:start position:0%
this bill provides actionable and
 
02:57:51.590 --> 02:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
quantifiable goals by specifying
 
02:57:53.570 --> 02:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions ruption
 
02:57:55.910 --> 02:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
reductions over the next 27 years
 
02:57:58.010 --> 02:57:58.020 align:start position:0%
including Net Zero greenhouse gas
 
02:58:00.410 --> 02:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
emissions by 2050.
 
02:58:02.630 --> 02:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
this bill also requires a New Hampshire
 
02:58:04.670 --> 02:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services to
 
02:58:06.590 --> 02:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
develop a plan to achieve the emissions
 
02:58:06.600 --> 02:58:08.330 align:start position:0%
develop a plan to achieve the emissions
reductions

02:58:08.330 --> 02:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
02:58:10.550 --> 02:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
this plan should provide the blueprints
 
02:58:12.650 --> 02:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
so sorely needed in New Hampshire to
 
02:58:14.090 --> 02:58:14.100 align:start position:0%
begin to deal with the climate change
 
02:58:14.100 --> 02:58:15.349 align:start position:0%
begin to deal with the climate change
challenge

02:58:15.349 --> 02:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
02:58:19.250 --> 02:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
this plan should go far beyond the state
 
02:58:21.170 --> 02:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
energy strategy in delivering needed
 
02:58:23.269 --> 02:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
changes including the way New Hampshire
 
02:58:25.670 --> 02:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
sources energy how it plans its
 
02:58:28.370 --> 02:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
Transportation future and monitorize
 
02:58:31.429 --> 02:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
excuse me moderate modernizes its
 
02:58:32.630 --> 02:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
electric grid
 
02:58:35.750 --> 02:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
this bill in concert with another bill
 
02:58:39.469 --> 02:58:39.479 align:start position:0%
in the senate senate Bill 166 an act
 
02:58:43.429 --> 02:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
relative electric grid modernization
 
02:58:45.830 --> 02:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
can result in needed modernization of
 
02:58:47.570 --> 02:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire distribution grid as
 
02:58:49.849 --> 02:58:49.859 align:start position:0%
we all know a major source of greenhouse
 
02:58:53.889 --> 02:58:53.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:55.670 --> 02:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
modernization of the New Hampshire
 
02:58:58.550 --> 02:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
distribution grid and finally it will
 
02:59:00.530 --> 02:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
provide a much needed unified approach
 
02:59:02.630 --> 02:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
to meeting the Energy Efficiency needs
 
02:59:05.410 --> 02:59:05.420 align:start position:0%
of low moderate income citizens
 
02:59:07.910 --> 02:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
introducing market-based electric rate
 
02:59:09.830 --> 02:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
structures including transactive energy
 
02:59:12.410 --> 02:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
techniques and Technology
 
02:59:14.630 --> 02:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
expanding the development of renewable
 
02:59:16.670 --> 02:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
and deployment of renewable energy
 
02:59:18.950 --> 02:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
that electrifying Heating and Cooling in
 
02:59:20.450 --> 02:59:20.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and a number of other
 
02:59:23.510 --> 02:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
nations with this within the state
 
02:59:25.250 --> 02:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
this bill will also provide a needed
 
02:59:26.990 --> 02:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
training for New Hampshire's Workforce
 
02:59:29.030 --> 02:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
to meet the technical challenges the
 
02:59:30.830 --> 02:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
state will face as it meets the
 
02:59:34.790 --> 02:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:37.610 --> 02:59:37.620 align:start position:0%
lastly this bill will finally begin to
 
02:59:39.290 --> 02:59:39.300 align:start position:0%
reduce our dependence on out-of-state
 
02:59:41.389 --> 02:59:41.399 align:start position:0%
electric generating sources and will
 
02:59:43.490 --> 02:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
keep New Hampshire's hard-earned earned
 
02:59:45.469 --> 02:59:45.479 align:start position:0%
energy dollars in state rather than
 
02:59:47.210 --> 02:59:47.220 align:start position:0%
continue to send them to corporations
 
02:59:50.030 --> 02:59:50.040 align:start position:0%

hello uh
 
03:00:53.570 --> 03:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
my name is Dominic Osmond I live in
 
03:00:56.269 --> 03:00:56.279 align:start position:0%
Manchester I am a registered lobbyist
 
03:00:59.210 --> 03:00:59.220 align:start position:0%
here representing 350 New Hampshire we
 
03:01:03.070 --> 03:01:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:06.469 --> 03:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
I am here to speak in support of HB 208
 
03:01:08.330 --> 03:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
and I strongly recommend that this
 
03:01:10.969 --> 03:01:10.979 align:start position:0%
committee votes in favor of this bill to
 
03:01:12.410 --> 03:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
ensure that New Hampshire is not left
 
03:01:15.110 --> 03:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
behind by neighboring states as has been
 
03:01:17.809 --> 03:01:17.819 align:start position:0%
mentioned New Hampshire is uh operating
 
03:01:19.429 --> 03:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
on the climate action plan that was
 
03:01:22.849 --> 03:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
drafted back in 2009 in the region of of
 
03:01:25.130 --> 03:01:25.140 align:start position:0%
New England the next most recent climate
 
03:01:27.950 --> 03:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
action plan was from 2016 and that was
 
03:01:30.469 --> 03:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
released by Rhode Island uh speaking
 
03:01:32.150 --> 03:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
personally it does not feel that good to
 
03:01:34.849 --> 03:01:34.859 align:start position:0%
be lagging that far behind such as Rhode
 
03:01:38.030 --> 03:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
Island and the rest of this region
 
03:01:40.190 --> 03:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
during this past summer and now during
 
03:01:41.809 --> 03:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
the winter we have been paying
 
03:01:43.969 --> 03:01:43.979 align:start position:0%
record-breaking utility bills both both
 
03:01:46.070 --> 03:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
for electrical generation as well as
 
03:01:48.530 --> 03:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
natural gas for heating
 
03:01:50.630 --> 03:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
this increased cost of living has been
 
03:01:52.130 --> 03:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
very difficult to deal with for many
 
03:01:54.710 --> 03:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
families and residents of the state we
 
03:01:56.750 --> 03:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
cannot remain unprepared in terms of
 
03:01:59.269 --> 03:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of and expanding and
 
03:02:01.630 --> 03:02:01.640 align:start position:0%
cheapening zero emission energy sources
 
03:02:04.070 --> 03:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
failure to do so will hurt New Hampshire
 
03:02:06.710 --> 03:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
working people what I really see as the
 
03:02:08.630 --> 03:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
biggest benefit of this climate action
 
03:02:11.809 --> 03:02:11.819 align:start position:0%
plan are the bill suggesting such is
 
03:02:13.910 --> 03:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
that it will prepare us help us prepare
 
03:02:15.889 --> 03:02:15.899 align:start position:0%
for changes that we know will be coming
 
03:02:18.889 --> 03:02:18.899 align:start position:0%
we can't decide whether or not fossil
 
03:02:21.410 --> 03:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
fuel power generation is going to be
 
03:02:23.570 --> 03:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
phased out in the next 20 years that is
 
03:02:25.670 --> 03:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
going to be happening by other states by
 
03:02:27.590 --> 03:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
other corporations and by other decision
 
03:02:30.710 --> 03:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
makers and it is incumbent upon us to be
 
03:02:34.070 --> 03:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
prepared for that and not be left behind
 
03:02:35.690 --> 03:02:35.700 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you the number of people
 
03:02:37.490 --> 03:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to are concerned not only
 
03:02:39.889 --> 03:02:39.899 align:start position:0%
with the long-term impacts of climate
 
03:02:41.630 --> 03:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
change such as the increased flooding
 
03:02:43.250 --> 03:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
and whether in extreme weather events
 
03:02:44.929 --> 03:02:44.939 align:start position:0%
that have been mentioned previously but
 
03:02:47.150 --> 03:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
also those increased costs of living uh
 
03:02:48.710 --> 03:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
not being able to to power and heat
 
03:02:51.590 --> 03:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
homes as well as being worried about uh
 
03:02:53.809 --> 03:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
whether or not roads will be able to to
 
03:02:55.550 --> 03:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
be passable whether that be from from
 
03:02:58.309 --> 03:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
flooding or from just uh breaking down
 
03:03:00.889 --> 03:03:00.899 align:start position:0%
and not being being updated
 
03:03:03.650 --> 03:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
uh for these reasons and many other I
 
03:03:05.090 --> 03:03:05.100 align:start position:0%
would like to again reiterate my support
 
03:03:06.950 --> 03:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
for for this bill and encourage
 
03:03:08.870 --> 03:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee to vote in
 
03:03:10.849 --> 03:03:10.859 align:start position:0%
favor of setting the greenhouse gas
 
03:03:13.070 --> 03:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
emissions reductions goal as well as
 
03:03:15.710 --> 03:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
establishing a climate action plan and
 
03:03:18.290 --> 03:03:18.300 align:start position:0%
perhaps as well amending it to recommend
 
03:03:20.870 --> 03:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
an appropriation for what sounds like a
 
03:03:22.730 --> 03:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
criminally underfunded and understaffed
 
03:03:25.130 --> 03:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services uh
 
03:03:26.750 --> 03:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much this concludes my
 
03:03:30.230 --> 03:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
testimony and I will take any questions
 
03:03:32.450 --> 03:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I
 
03:03:32.460 --> 03:03:33.469 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I
um

03:03:33.469 --> 03:03:33.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:36.170 --> 03:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
I'm pleased that you respected our time
 
03:03:41.450 --> 03:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:42.950 --> 03:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like anybody has any
 
03:03:44.570 --> 03:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
questions so I'll thank you for being
 
03:03:46.550 --> 03:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
here thank you and I'll call on the
 
03:03:49.969 --> 03:03:49.979 align:start position:0%
final uh testifier for on this bill
 
03:03:52.550 --> 03:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's Meredith Hatfield of The Nature
 
03:03:57.170 --> 03:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:58.849 --> 03:03:58.859 align:start position:0%
pretty much chairman Vos and members of
 
03:04:00.349 --> 03:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm going to start my
 
03:04:02.929 --> 03:04:02.939 align:start position:0%
timer but I know you'll interrupt me if
 
03:04:05.750 --> 03:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
I start to go over like many of the
 
03:04:07.790 --> 03:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
prior speakers The Nature Conservancy
 
03:04:11.510 --> 03:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
strongly supports this bill and as
 
03:04:13.969 --> 03:04:13.979 align:start position:0%
someone who was able to participate in
 
03:04:16.670 --> 03:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
the 2009 climate action plan process
 
03:04:20.389 --> 03:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
myself and also TNC had a seat on that
 
03:04:24.050 --> 03:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
body I can say it really was an amazing
 
03:04:26.450 --> 03:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
opportunity to bring together interests
 
03:04:29.450 --> 03:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
from around the state including many
 
03:04:31.309 --> 03:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
agencies of state government from
 
03:04:34.730 --> 03:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
transportation to insurance and then des
 
03:04:37.550 --> 03:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
and and the energy agencies it really
 
03:04:41.150 --> 03:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
started to help us get a picture of what
 
03:04:43.190 --> 03:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
we needed to address and for things like
 
03:04:45.290 --> 03:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
insurance which are you know I'm not an
 
03:04:47.210 --> 03:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
insurance person but it was fascinating
 
03:04:49.010 --> 03:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
to learn from the New Hampshire
 
03:04:51.170 --> 03:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Insurance about the things
 
03:04:53.389 --> 03:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
they're thinking about with respect to
 
03:04:55.190 --> 03:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
climate change
 
03:04:58.730 --> 03:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
we see a strong climate plan as
 
03:05:00.710 --> 03:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
something that can direct investment it
 
03:05:02.570 --> 03:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
can help us protect our infrastructure
 
03:05:05.690 --> 03:05:05.700 align:start position:0%
it can help Drive Innovation and one
 
03:05:07.790 --> 03:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
area that's particularly of importance
 
03:05:09.410 --> 03:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
for the nature conservancy and our
 
03:05:11.150 --> 03:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
partners is the resilience and
 
03:05:14.210 --> 03:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
adaptation piece we are seeing impacts
 
03:05:17.269 --> 03:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
on the ground every day in our state and
 
03:05:18.889 --> 03:05:18.899 align:start position:0%
we are working closely with state
 
03:05:21.349 --> 03:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
agencies and with municipalities to help
 
03:05:23.809 --> 03:05:23.819 align:start position:0%
them figure out how do we protect our
 
03:05:25.790 --> 03:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and how do we make
 
03:05:28.130 --> 03:05:28.140 align:start position:0%
smarter Investments so that our
 
03:05:30.050 --> 03:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
infrastructure can handle that 100-year
 
03:05:32.269 --> 03:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
flood that is no longer every hundred
 
03:05:34.130 --> 03:05:34.140 align:start position:0%
years but it's happening you know every
 
03:05:36.590 --> 03:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
few years in some places
 
03:05:38.690 --> 03:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
with respect to the funding as someone
 
03:05:40.910 --> 03:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
who served in state government in
 
03:05:42.769 --> 03:05:42.779 align:start position:0%
several capacities I certainly can
 
03:05:46.190 --> 03:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
relate to not having resources we do
 
03:05:48.410 --> 03:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
think that the two pieces of major
 
03:05:49.969 --> 03:05:49.979 align:start position:0%
federal legislation that have passed
 
03:05:52.130 --> 03:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
over the last 18 months
 
03:05:55.550 --> 03:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
um bil and Ira as they are known could
 
03:05:57.950 --> 03:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
have significant potential resources to
 
03:06:00.889 --> 03:06:00.899 align:start position:0%
be able to fund this effort and I think
 
03:06:02.450 --> 03:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of Partners including
 
03:06:03.950 --> 03:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
possibly the New Hampshire charitable
 
03:06:06.050 --> 03:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
Foundation who might be willing to put
 
03:06:07.490 --> 03:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
our heads together and come up with the
 
03:06:09.590 --> 03:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
funding necessary for this
 
03:06:11.889 --> 03:06:11.899 align:start position:0%
several speakers during your orientation
 
03:06:14.870 --> 03:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
including all of our utilities spoke
 
03:06:17.990 --> 03:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
about the need for our state to have a
 
03:06:21.230 --> 03:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
plan and to me that is a clear call for
 
03:06:23.690 --> 03:06:23.700 align:start position:0%
this kind of work you also heard it from
 
03:06:26.690 --> 03:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
the regional grid operator and we also I
 
03:06:28.309 --> 03:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
think heard it from the power generators
 
03:06:31.010 --> 03:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
that clean energy is the future and we
 
03:06:32.750 --> 03:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
need to figure out a path to get there
 
03:06:34.910 --> 03:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
that's affordable
 
03:06:38.870 --> 03:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
with respect to the RSA section of the
 
03:06:40.910 --> 03:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
bill that refers to
 
03:06:40.920 --> 03:06:41.650 align:start position:0%
bill that refers to
um

03:06:41.650 --> 03:06:41.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:41.660 --> 03:06:43.210 align:start position:0%
um
uh

03:06:43.210 --> 03:06:43.220 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:06:46.670 --> 03:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
378.37 that my understanding is that is
 
03:06:48.830 --> 03:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
the current statute
 
03:06:52.210 --> 03:06:52.220 align:start position:0%
um that guides uh largely the puc
 
03:06:55.370 --> 03:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
in ensuring lease cost energy planning
 
03:06:58.309 --> 03:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
and I think obviously the sponsors can
 
03:07:01.070 --> 03:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
can talk about their goals here but I
 
03:07:04.250 --> 03:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
think this the major changes to add in
 
03:07:07.550 --> 03:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
section c so this is um page four of the
 
03:07:10.429 --> 03:07:10.439 align:start position:0%
bill on line 11. so the cost
 
03:07:13.849 --> 03:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness reliability diversity safe
 
03:07:16.150 --> 03:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
safety and health those
 
03:07:19.070 --> 03:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
requirements are already in that law and
 
03:07:20.990 --> 03:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
one of the changes this section makes is
 
03:07:23.090 --> 03:07:23.100 align:start position:0%
to add in the greenhouse gas emission
 
03:07:23.100 --> 03:07:26.030 align:start position:0%
to add in the greenhouse gas emission
goals

03:07:26.030 --> 03:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:28.370 --> 03:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
um one small thing is that there are a
 
03:07:29.870 --> 03:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
few references in this bill to the
 
03:07:31.790 --> 03:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
office of strategic initiatives which
 
03:07:33.410 --> 03:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
clearly would need to be updated to the
 
03:07:35.590 --> 03:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
 
03:07:37.790 --> 03:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
representative Summers question about
 
03:07:41.210 --> 03:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
the 20 reduction because that is a
 
03:07:43.429 --> 03:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
reduction from 1990 levels I think we're
 
03:07:45.290 --> 03:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
actually doing pretty well there I think
 
03:07:46.969 --> 03:07:46.979 align:start position:0%
between Reggie and our efficiency
 
03:07:48.889 --> 03:07:48.899 align:start position:0%
programs and some of our other
 
03:07:51.170 --> 03:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
successful policies and programs I think
 
03:07:53.210 --> 03:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
we might be pretty close to that but I'm
 
03:07:57.349 --> 03:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
sure Des could answer that more fully 30
 
03:07:57.359 --> 03:08:02.030 align:start position:0%
sure Des could answer that more fully 30
seconds

03:08:02.030 --> 03:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:03.830 --> 03:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
I think that was
 
03:08:05.389 --> 03:08:05.399 align:start position:0%
um all that I wanted to cover thank you
 
03:08:06.530 --> 03:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
very much
 
03:08:07.910 --> 03:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions
 
03:08:10.670 --> 03:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
03:08:12.769 --> 03:08:12.779 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for coming
 
03:08:14.210 --> 03:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
back again
 
03:08:15.590 --> 03:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
um as somebody that's worked in the
 
03:08:18.950 --> 03:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
public policy arena for years
 
03:08:22.250 --> 03:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
um can you speak to
 
03:08:25.429 --> 03:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
um the influence that
 
03:08:28.730 --> 03:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
um the existence or non-existence of a
 
03:08:32.210 --> 03:08:32.220 align:start position:0%
plan has on on
 
03:08:32.220 --> 03:08:32.809 align:start position:0%
plan has on on
um

03:08:32.809 --> 03:08:32.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:34.429 --> 03:08:34.439 align:start position:0%
in in
 
03:08:37.490 --> 03:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
um just moving moving people along and
 
03:08:41.510 --> 03:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
encouraging Innovation and and and ways
 
03:08:43.809 --> 03:08:43.819 align:start position:0%
to address address a particular problem
 
03:08:47.510 --> 03:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
and can you can you comment on how that
 
03:08:50.929 --> 03:08:50.939 align:start position:0%
lack of a plan has really what what
 
03:08:53.030 --> 03:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
influences that had on how we've been
 
03:08:55.070 --> 03:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
able to address some of the challenges
 
03:08:57.290 --> 03:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
and opportunities in climate change
 
03:08:59.750 --> 03:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um you know I think this bill
 
03:09:02.750 --> 03:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
the structure that this lays out would
 
03:09:05.269 --> 03:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
be extremely helpful for agencies all
 
03:09:07.429 --> 03:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
across the state and and as I referenced
 
03:09:10.030 --> 03:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
participating in the 2009 process
 
03:09:12.650 --> 03:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
breaking down those silos and also
 
03:09:14.750 --> 03:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
seeing all of the interconnected ways
 
03:09:16.429 --> 03:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
that agencies could be working together
 
03:09:19.210 --> 03:09:19.220 align:start position:0%
whether it's Transportation or Energy
 
03:09:23.929 --> 03:09:23.939 align:start position:0%
Des our business agency having that plan
 
03:09:26.330 --> 03:09:26.340 align:start position:0%
and being able to develop it together as
 
03:09:29.170 --> 03:09:29.180 align:start position:0%
a group is extremely helpful on Guiding
 
03:09:31.490 --> 03:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
agency work
 
03:09:33.050 --> 03:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
um I you know I do think if the
 
03:09:35.630 --> 03:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
committee is not comfortable moving
 
03:09:37.610 --> 03:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
forward with this bill as currently
 
03:09:40.670 --> 03:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
drafted I would urge you to retain it
 
03:09:43.130 --> 03:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
and work on it more it if you feel like
 
03:09:44.990 --> 03:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
it needs more work I think there are a
 
03:09:46.490 --> 03:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
lot of people who would be happy to
 
03:09:48.710 --> 03:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
contribute to that process
 
03:09:50.269 --> 03:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
um and I think there is a famous saying
 
03:09:52.610 --> 03:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
about how if you don't if you don't plan
 
03:09:55.190 --> 03:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
you can't manage what you have and I
 
03:10:00.410 --> 03:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:01.790 --> 03:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:10:04.610 --> 03:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
03:10:06.710 --> 03:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
seeing none I want to thank you for
 
03:10:08.570 --> 03:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
being here to testify on this bill
 
03:10:10.370 --> 03:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
chairman Vos I'm sorry I just thought of
 
03:10:12.170 --> 03:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
one other thing um if you don't mind
 
03:10:14.450 --> 03:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas referred to the
 
03:10:18.710 --> 03:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
the interplay between RSA 378 and then
 
03:10:21.050 --> 03:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
the state energy strategy statute and I
 
03:10:22.490 --> 03:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
did just want to give you the reference
 
03:10:24.530 --> 03:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
for that so the state energy strategy is
 
03:10:27.889 --> 03:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
separately required in law under RSA
 
03:10:27.899 --> 03:10:30.530 align:start position:0%
separately required in law under RSA
12p7

03:10:30.530 --> 03:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
12p7
 
03:10:33.050 --> 03:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you you're welcome
 
03:10:35.150 --> 03:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas actually has
 
03:10:37.250 --> 03:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
a question yeah can we just clarify that
 
03:10:39.349 --> 03:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
that was representative Doug Thomas's
 
03:10:43.370 --> 03:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:45.170 --> 03:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
well done
 
03:10:47.929 --> 03:10:47.939 align:start position:0%
accomplished okay so now we're done
 
03:10:50.030 --> 03:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so I'm going to
 
03:10:52.670 --> 03:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on
 
03:10:55.010 --> 03:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
House Bill 208 and ask representative
 
03:10:58.370 --> 03:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
closure to give us the blue sheet sign
 
03:11:01.010 --> 03:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
in information on this bill
 
03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair House Bill 208 the
 
03:11:08.690 --> 03:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
blue sheet was three in support one
 
03:11:14.750 --> 03:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
against Bill online in support was 166.
 
03:11:17.630 --> 03:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
and against was 12.
 
03:11:19.910 --> 03:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
03:11:22.490 --> 03:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
with that we will conclude the morning
 
03:11:25.250 --> 03:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
activity of science technology and
 
03:11:27.170 --> 03:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
energy for Monday
 
03:11:29.929 --> 03:11:29.939 align:start position:0%
the 30th of January
 
03:11:32.929 --> 03:11:32.939 align:start position:0%
will be officially on recess until 1 30
 
03:11:35.950 --> 03:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
at which time we will take up House Bill
 
03:11:39.170 --> 03:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
443 establishing a commission to study
 
03:11:41.510 --> 03:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
the withdrawal of New Hampshire from ISO
 
03:11:44.690 --> 03:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
New England we will see you then
 
04:30:56.149 --> 04:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:59.750 --> 04:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay it is 1 30 according to my
 
04:31:01.910 --> 04:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
whiz-bang Gadget here
 
04:31:05.210 --> 04:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
and uh so I would like to open the
 
04:31:09.530 --> 04:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 443 which
 
04:31:11.689 --> 04:31:11.699 align:start position:0%
is a bill establishing a commission to
 
04:31:14.630 --> 04:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
study the withdrawal of New Hampshire
 
04:31:17.929 --> 04:31:17.939 align:start position:0%
from ISO New England
 
04:31:19.729 --> 04:31:19.739 align:start position:0%
and I would like to call on the primary
 
04:31:21.309 --> 04:31:21.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill
 
04:31:24.290 --> 04:31:24.300 align:start position:0%
representative J.D Bernardi to introduce
 
04:31:29.330 --> 04:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
this legislation good afternoon Mr Clerk
 
04:31:32.750 --> 04:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and committee uh as
 
04:31:35.030 --> 04:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
indicated I'm JD Bernardi I serve the
 
04:31:38.510 --> 04:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
southeast corner of New Hampshire I come
 
04:31:41.349 --> 04:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
from Southampton I surprised to support
 
04:31:45.950 --> 04:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 443 and act establishing a
 
04:31:47.689 --> 04:31:47.699 align:start position:0%
commission to study withdrawal of New
 
04:31:49.910 --> 04:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from ISO New England so the
 
04:31:52.910 --> 04:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
bill has basically three main components
 
04:31:56.269 --> 04:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
one who all the members are two what the
 
04:31:59.090 --> 04:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
task is which is to enumerate and assess
 
04:32:02.149 --> 04:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
the advantages and disadvantages of
 
04:32:04.849 --> 04:32:04.859 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from ISO New England and
 
04:32:07.010 --> 04:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
becoming an independent grid operator
 
04:32:09.590 --> 04:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
Market administrator and power system
 
04:32:13.250 --> 04:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
planner and the third item is to issue a
 
04:32:16.090 --> 04:32:16.100 align:start position:0%
report by the end of the end of the year
 
04:32:18.469 --> 04:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:32:21.469 --> 04:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
so Connecticut and Maine have also
 
04:32:23.510 --> 04:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
conducted similar assessments I think
 
04:32:25.309 --> 04:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
that gives us a leg up if we would do
 
04:32:26.870 --> 04:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
this we can read their reports and
 
04:32:28.849 --> 04:32:28.859 align:start position:0%
understand what their issues were
 
04:32:32.870 --> 04:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
particularly uh well both pros and cons
 
04:32:35.990 --> 04:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
but I want to turn to my rationale for
 
04:32:37.610 --> 04:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
submitting this bill
 
04:32:39.710 --> 04:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
first is
 
04:32:42.950 --> 04:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
in my campaign one of the key issues
 
04:32:46.630 --> 04:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
that I faced was explaining to
 
04:32:49.910 --> 04:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
constituents why there was skyrocketing
 
04:32:53.090 --> 04:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
costs of electric power it was a
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
universal issue in almost any door I
 
04:32:56.640 --> 04:32:57.830 align:start position:0%
universal issue in almost any door I
knocked

04:32:57.830 --> 04:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
knocked
 
04:33:01.969 --> 04:33:01.979 align:start position:0%
now if New Hampshire were to be its own
 
04:33:04.849 --> 04:33:04.859 align:start position:0%
ISO group or withdrawal it would get the
 
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
full benefit of the sebrick nuclear
 
04:33:09.289 --> 04:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
power station so you see in one of these
 
04:33:11.510 --> 04:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
handouts I have here what's the peak
 
04:33:13.490 --> 04:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
power in New Hampshire it's a little
 
04:33:13.500 --> 04:33:15.230 align:start position:0%
power in New Hampshire it's a little
over

04:33:15.230 --> 04:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:33:15.240 --> 04:33:16.750 align:start position:0%
over
um

04:33:16.750 --> 04:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:21.590 --> 04:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
2000 or 2100 uh megawatts what does
 
04:33:25.010 --> 04:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
Seabrook produce about 1200. so that's
 
04:33:26.929 --> 04:33:26.939 align:start position:0%
about 60 percent of the power for New
 
04:33:30.709 --> 04:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire similarly we have hydro that
 
04:33:34.189 --> 04:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
we share with uh Vermont we have half of
 
04:33:37.310 --> 04:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
that and a lot of small-scale hydro
 
04:33:37.320 --> 04:33:39.470 align:start position:0%
that and a lot of small-scale hydro
so

04:33:39.470 --> 04:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:41.750 --> 04:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunities to
 
04:33:45.650 --> 04:33:45.660 align:start position:0%
substantially reduce the cost of power
 
04:33:48.650 --> 04:33:48.660 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire because we have we have
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
good base load that would cover most
 
04:33:53.090 --> 04:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
most of our cost
 
04:33:54.709 --> 04:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
second reason
 
04:33:58.849 --> 04:33:58.859 align:start position:0%
virtually all new capacity being uh
 
04:34:03.410 --> 04:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
considered by ISO New England is uh is
 
04:34:05.230 --> 04:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
all Renewables
 
04:34:08.631 --> 04:34:08.641 align:start position:0%
and as they indicated in their report to
 
04:34:08.641 --> 04:34:11.929 align:start position:0%
and as they indicated in their report to
us

04:34:11.929 --> 04:34:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:15.349 --> 04:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
it would require fast responding sources
 
04:34:17.869 --> 04:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
like grid scale energy resources to
 
04:34:20.269 --> 04:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
balance the variability of Renewables
 
04:34:20.279 --> 04:34:21.910 align:start position:0%
balance the variability of Renewables
meaning

04:34:21.910 --> 04:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
04:34:27.410 --> 04:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
Renewables are not reliable power for us
 
04:34:29.349 --> 04:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
if you look at
 
04:34:34.010 --> 04:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
again this sheet which I handed out it
 
04:34:38.269 --> 04:34:38.279 align:start position:0%
it has the their projected uh new power
 
04:34:42.769 --> 04:34:42.779 align:start position:0%
sources you see 60 win 21 batteries
 
04:34:45.051 --> 04:34:45.061 align:start position:0%
fifteen percent solar
 
04:34:45.061 --> 04:34:46.910 align:start position:0%
fifteen percent solar
and

04:34:46.910 --> 04:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:50.949 --> 04:34:50.959 align:start position:0%
so I as as I indicated virtually all is
 
04:34:54.109 --> 04:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
renewable based the massive batteries
 
04:34:58.131 --> 04:34:58.141 align:start position:0%
currently do not exist and if they
 
04:35:01.131 --> 04:35:01.141 align:start position:0%
existed would only Supply four hours of
 
04:35:01.141 --> 04:35:02.750 align:start position:0%
existed would only Supply four hours of
power

04:35:02.750 --> 04:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
power
 
04:35:06.949 --> 04:35:06.959 align:start position:0%
iso's 2050 study says fossil fuel units
 
04:35:09.949 --> 04:35:09.959 align:start position:0%
will be necessary for energy balance
 
04:35:11.990 --> 04:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
meaning that if we're going to have
 
04:35:14.929 --> 04:35:14.939 align:start position:0%
reliable power we have to build twice we
 
04:35:16.849 --> 04:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
got to build Renewables and then we have
 
04:35:19.869 --> 04:35:19.879 align:start position:0%
to build a reliable fossil fuel
 
04:35:23.330 --> 04:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
source to Supply Power
 
04:35:26.510 --> 04:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
pass between North and South New England
 
04:35:28.970 --> 04:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
would need significant upgrades to
 
04:35:31.609 --> 04:35:31.619 align:start position:0%
transfer Surplus generation in Northern
 
04:35:33.890 --> 04:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
New England to generation in Southern
 
04:35:35.510 --> 04:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
New England
 
04:35:37.789 --> 04:35:37.799 align:start position:0%
meaning although mass and Connecticut
 
04:35:41.090 --> 04:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
have large wind and solar projects they
 
04:35:45.769 --> 04:35:45.779 align:start position:0%
they will be inadequate or as noted drop
 
04:35:48.529 --> 04:35:48.539 align:start position:0%
off before construction as ISO has
 
04:35:50.510 --> 04:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
pointed out in their in their
 
04:35:53.209 --> 04:35:53.219 align:start position:0%
presentation to us last week
 
04:35:55.010 --> 04:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
so they will look to Northern New
 
04:35:57.529 --> 04:35:57.539 align:start position:0%
England to fill the void
 
04:36:00.650 --> 04:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing is cost shifting from
 
04:36:04.131 --> 04:36:04.141 align:start position:0%
those states that are heavily relying on
 
04:36:06.289 --> 04:36:06.299 align:start position:0%
building out Renewables
 
04:36:09.529 --> 04:36:09.539 align:start position:0%
from Mass Connecticut Rhode Island to
 
04:36:11.929 --> 04:36:11.939 align:start position:0%
the rate payers of New Hampshire again
 
04:36:14.390 --> 04:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
going back to my very first point why
 
04:36:17.150 --> 04:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
did I propose this study
 
04:36:23.150 --> 04:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:27.949 --> 04:36:27.959 align:start position:0%
so I uh earnestly request your attention
 
04:36:31.910 --> 04:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
to at least study the prospect of
 
04:36:36.410 --> 04:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
whether New Hampshire has advantages
 
04:36:39.470 --> 04:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
or as well as disadvantages of dropping
 
04:36:41.689 --> 04:36:41.699 align:start position:0%
out of isil New England and becoming an
 
04:36:45.051 --> 04:36:45.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:48.410 --> 04:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
with that I'm open for questions
 
04:36:51.109 --> 04:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
I might add that the quotes that I
 
04:36:53.590 --> 04:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned about I saw New England's
 
04:36:56.869 --> 04:36:56.879 align:start position:0%
concerns for the future are found on
 
04:37:02.929 --> 04:37:02.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:05.029 --> 04:37:05.039 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you for that present
 
04:37:08.510 --> 04:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me that uh Bill introduction
 
04:37:10.490 --> 04:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
and representative notter would like to
 
04:37:11.990 --> 04:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
ask you a question
 
04:37:13.490 --> 04:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
hi thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:37:15.051 --> 04:37:15.061 align:start position:0%
taking the question I'm a little
 
04:37:17.090 --> 04:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
confused so you're gonna have to um
 
04:37:19.670 --> 04:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
help me out here because ISO New England
 
04:37:21.650 --> 04:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
we've been there it's like NORAD from
 
04:37:24.170 --> 04:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
that movie in the 80s
 
04:37:26.570 --> 04:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
if we're not on that grid then where
 
04:37:28.250 --> 04:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
will our grid be
 
04:37:30.349 --> 04:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
it was it would be run out of New
 
04:37:33.590 --> 04:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so probably the most logical
 
04:37:35.689 --> 04:37:35.699 align:start position:0%
station would be where eversource
 
04:37:38.449 --> 04:37:38.459 align:start position:0%
operates out of they they cover most of
 
04:37:41.390 --> 04:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh most of New Hampshire and and they
 
04:37:43.250 --> 04:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
have all the interconnections with the
 
04:37:46.189 --> 04:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
other utilities there as well but it
 
04:37:49.310 --> 04:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
would it would be obviously a cost to
 
04:37:52.551 --> 04:37:52.561 align:start position:0%
create a New Hampshire owned New
 
04:37:55.849 --> 04:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire operated station
 
04:37:58.849 --> 04:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
follow-up but would the cost benefit
 
04:38:01.789 --> 04:38:01.799 align:start position:0%
ratio be in our favor
 
04:38:03.230 --> 04:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
that's why I asked for the study
 
04:38:04.910 --> 04:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
commission what are the pros what are
 
04:38:09.230 --> 04:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:14.869 --> 04:38:14.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:15.890 --> 04:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:38:17.150 --> 04:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned a lot
 
04:38:18.830 --> 04:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
about Seabrook stations I have a couple
 
04:38:21.109 --> 04:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
of concerns with that
 
04:38:22.730 --> 04:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
um first of all obviously it doesn't run
 
04:38:24.590 --> 04:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
all the time so it's a good capacity
 
04:38:27.109 --> 04:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
factor in the low 90s so it would be out
 
04:38:29.269 --> 04:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
we'd have to replace that power I assume
 
04:38:32.150 --> 04:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh but you would say it would stay in
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right now Seabrook has
 
04:38:37.730 --> 04:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
contracts with out of state uh uh energy
 
04:38:40.010 --> 04:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
suppliers uh down in Connecticut for
 
04:38:42.650 --> 04:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
example would you somehow void those
 
04:38:44.750 --> 04:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
contracts and make C work only sell
 
04:38:46.250 --> 04:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
their power in New Hampshire or they'd
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
be free to sell it wherever they select
 
04:38:50.570 --> 04:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
fit to see it like they do now
 
04:38:53.090 --> 04:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
I I'm presuming that would be one of the
 
04:38:55.490 --> 04:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
issues studied by the commission and I'm
 
04:38:57.890 --> 04:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
presuming that if they said oh it makes
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
sense to do this then the legislative
 
04:39:02.810 --> 04:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
solution would be to create a New
 
04:39:05.869 --> 04:39:05.879 align:start position:0%
Hampshire focused ISO that said New
 
04:39:08.390 --> 04:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire producers must sell first to
 
04:39:10.730 --> 04:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire any excess could go out
 
04:39:14.090 --> 04:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
but I I don't know it's just you know
 
04:39:17.631 --> 04:39:17.641 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up yeah um have you
 
04:39:20.090 --> 04:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
looked into what the legal requirements
 
04:39:22.429 --> 04:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
are I mean it's just I don't think it's
 
04:39:23.631 --> 04:39:23.641 align:start position:0%
a matter of Simply New Hampshire
 
04:39:25.609 --> 04:39:25.619 align:start position:0%
announcing to the rest of New England
 
04:39:28.070 --> 04:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
we're leaving because obviously it has
 
04:39:30.051 --> 04:39:30.061 align:start position:0%
huge ramifications on the other states
 
04:39:33.709 --> 04:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
so we're generally an exporter of power
 
04:39:35.209 --> 04:39:35.219 align:start position:0%
um we put we produce more than we
 
04:39:37.910 --> 04:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
consume that is so is there any legal
 
04:39:39.890 --> 04:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
requirements that could Massachusetts
 
04:39:41.690 --> 04:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
block this would they take us to court
 
04:39:43.610 --> 04:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
is there what is the commitment that New
 
04:39:45.948 --> 04:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire made to become part of iso New
 
04:39:47.690 --> 04:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
England and what would be the how would
 
04:39:51.530 --> 04:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
they get out of that well we're the ISO
 
04:39:53.510 --> 04:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
structures regulated by the federal
 
04:39:55.610 --> 04:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
energy energy regulatory commissions
 
04:39:59.630 --> 04:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
Burke so you know if we be if we wanted
 
04:40:01.070 --> 04:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
to become independent we're going to
 
04:40:02.990 --> 04:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
have to comply with with whatever
 
04:40:05.810 --> 04:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
whatever those laws are and I'm sure our
 
04:40:05.820 --> 04:40:07.130 align:start position:0%
whatever those laws are and I'm sure our
neighbors

04:40:07.130 --> 04:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 
04:40:09.470 --> 04:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
when they see they're going to end up
 
04:40:12.050 --> 04:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
paying more for their power and their
 
04:40:13.970 --> 04:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
decisions on how they want their power
 
04:40:17.448 --> 04:40:17.458 align:start position:0%
generated would sue us yes we are a net
 
04:40:19.970 --> 04:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
power producer and a net cheaper power
 
04:40:19.980 --> 04:40:23.930 align:start position:0%
power producer and a net cheaper power
producer

04:40:23.930 --> 04:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:27.050 --> 04:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh representative Kaplan has a question
 
04:40:29.090 --> 04:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question Mr chair
 
04:40:31.130 --> 04:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative
 
04:40:33.650 --> 04:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
um this is a similar question in in
 
04:40:36.530 --> 04:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
terms of the ferc uh any withdrawal that
 
04:40:39.530 --> 04:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
we or that our utilities decided to do
 
04:40:41.390 --> 04:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
would have to be approved by the Federal
 
04:40:43.788 --> 04:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
Energy Regulatory Commission and since
 
04:40:46.850 --> 04:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
their main interest is ensuring Regional
 
04:40:50.330 --> 04:40:50.340 align:start position:0%
grid stability of transmission and by
 
04:40:52.850 --> 04:40:52.860 align:start position:0%
withdrawing from the iso we would be
 
04:40:54.590 --> 04:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
blowing a big hole in the regional power
 
04:40:54.600 --> 04:40:56.030 align:start position:0%
blowing a big hole in the regional power
system

04:40:56.030 --> 04:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:40:58.610 --> 04:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
how do you just two questions how do you
 
04:41:00.470 --> 04:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
foresee them ever allowing us to leave
 
04:41:02.330 --> 04:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
and if if they didn't allow us to leave
 
04:41:04.670 --> 04:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
would the scope of your study commission
 
04:41:07.550 --> 04:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
include disentangling ourselves from
 
04:41:12.530 --> 04:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
federal regulations and uh you know of
 
04:41:13.970 --> 04:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
the entity that we call the United
 
04:41:13.980 --> 04:41:16.850 align:start position:0%
the entity that we call the United
States

04:41:16.850 --> 04:41:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think we're going to disentangle
 
04:41:20.628 --> 04:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
from the United States
 
04:41:24.590 --> 04:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
over energy uh what the legal
 
04:41:27.590 --> 04:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
ramifications are of disentangling from
 
04:41:29.570 --> 04:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
farker changing jurisdictional
 
04:41:34.430 --> 04:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
boundaries of of an ISO uh grid area I
 
04:41:36.410 --> 04:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
those are interesting legal questions
 
04:41:38.990 --> 04:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
and that's that's why we need a study
 
04:41:41.030 --> 04:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
commission to do this this is a bigger
 
04:41:43.190 --> 04:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
question than us just sitting down here
 
04:41:45.410 --> 04:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
and saying oh the pros and cons of this
 
04:41:48.770 --> 04:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
are and let's do it we we need a study
 
04:41:52.250 --> 04:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
commission to evaluate those pros and
 
04:41:52.260 --> 04:41:53.930 align:start position:0%
commission to evaluate those pros and
cons

04:41:53.930 --> 04:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
cons
 
04:41:56.990 --> 04:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up you know I'm assuming you have
 
04:41:58.550 --> 04:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
a theory of the case of for how this
 
04:42:01.010 --> 04:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
would lead to any benefits for a New
 
04:42:02.990 --> 04:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rate payers uh considering
 
04:42:04.670 --> 04:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
that you know we really don't own
 
04:42:06.230 --> 04:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
Seabrook or the Schiller Power Station
 
04:42:07.788 --> 04:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
those are private companies that have to
 
04:42:09.230 --> 04:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
rent the contracts on their own behalf
 
04:42:11.390 --> 04:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
and we could unless we seceded from the
 
04:42:13.670 --> 04:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
United States and nationalize those
 
04:42:16.610 --> 04:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
those assets we can't tell them what to
 
04:42:16.620 --> 04:42:17.570 align:start position:0%
those assets we can't tell them what to
do

04:42:17.570 --> 04:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:42:19.490 --> 04:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
so how did what is your theory of the
 
04:42:22.190 --> 04:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
case How would how would we be able to
 
04:42:24.190 --> 04:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
provide lower rates
 
04:42:26.628 --> 04:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire ratepayers given that
 
04:42:28.490 --> 04:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
you know the administration and the the
 
04:42:30.288 --> 04:42:30.298 align:start position:0%
regulation and all those all those
 
04:42:31.788 --> 04:42:31.798 align:start position:0%
Services we would have to provide
 
04:42:34.788 --> 04:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
ourselves all the power producers in in
 
04:42:37.610 --> 04:42:37.620 align:start position:0%
the uh in in the region are privately
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
owned none of the the well there's a few
 
04:42:42.230 --> 04:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
in Vermont that are publicly owned
 
04:42:45.170 --> 04:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
because they didn't uh totally sign on
 
04:42:51.350 --> 04:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
to uh the a a entirely private uh uh
 
04:42:54.288 --> 04:42:54.298 align:start position:0%
Power production plan but all all states
 
04:42:56.150 --> 04:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
are that way so
 
04:42:58.310 --> 04:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
we share
 
04:43:02.150 --> 04:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
power production between all those
 
04:43:04.190 --> 04:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
States so if we would become our own
 
04:43:06.890 --> 04:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
entity then we would share that power
 
04:43:09.230 --> 04:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
production in New Hampshire and the
 
04:43:11.628 --> 04:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
other five states which would uh would
 
04:43:14.208 --> 04:43:14.218 align:start position:0%
share their power production it's just
 
04:43:17.208 --> 04:43:17.218 align:start position:0%
simply dividing the pie up that way
 
04:43:19.310 --> 04:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
04:43:19.320 --> 04:43:20.570 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
question

04:43:20.570 --> 04:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:43:22.730 --> 04:43:22.740 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mrs more of a housekeeping
 
04:43:25.368 --> 04:43:25.378 align:start position:0%
one here uh on on your commission I
 
04:43:28.010 --> 04:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
noticed you didn't include the consumer
 
04:43:30.288 --> 04:43:30.298 align:start position:0%
Advocate on here
 
04:43:32.810 --> 04:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
um I don't think I saw it in all league
 
04:43:35.690 --> 04:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
is there oh maybe I missed it but on the
 
04:43:37.628 --> 04:43:37.638 align:start position:0%
four House of Representatives
 
04:43:40.850 --> 04:43:40.860 align:start position:0%
would use succumb to a suggestion that
 
04:43:42.050 --> 04:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
at least two of them should be coming
 
04:43:43.610 --> 04:43:43.620 align:start position:0%
from the uh from the Science and Tech
 
04:43:49.368 --> 04:43:49.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:52.368 --> 04:43:52.378 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
04:43:54.170 --> 04:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:43:55.970 --> 04:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill
 
04:43:58.610 --> 04:43:58.620 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that Maine and
 
04:43:59.868 --> 04:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
Connecticut have done similar
 
04:44:01.850 --> 04:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
assessments do you know what their
 
04:44:03.170 --> 04:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
recommendation or what their conclusions
 
04:44:03.180 --> 04:44:04.070 align:start position:0%
recommendation or what their conclusions
were

04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:44:07.550 --> 04:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
they in the end decided not to move
 
04:44:09.530 --> 04:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
forward and I do not know the full
 
04:44:11.990 --> 04:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
rationale why
 
04:44:12.000 --> 04:44:13.330 align:start position:0%
rationale why
um

04:44:13.330 --> 04:44:13.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:16.490 --> 04:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
neither of them are net power producers
 
04:44:18.230 --> 04:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire and that may be one
 
04:44:19.670 --> 04:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
of the key reasons
 
04:44:22.910 --> 04:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
they would have to rely on still getting
 
04:44:28.430 --> 04:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:32.030 --> 04:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy no
 
04:44:38.230 --> 04:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:42.770 --> 04:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:44.868 --> 04:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no more questions from the
 
04:44:46.490 --> 04:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
committee we thank you representative
 
04:44:49.250 --> 04:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
Bernardi for introducing the bill
 
04:44:52.550 --> 04:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
and we will now call on Josh Elliott
 
04:44:54.230 --> 04:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
representing the department of energy
 
04:44:58.128 --> 04:44:58.138 align:start position:0%
for his testimony on House Bill 443.
 
04:45:02.750 --> 04:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:04.610 --> 04:45:04.620 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
04:45:06.050 --> 04:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record Josh
 
04:45:07.550 --> 04:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
Elliott director of the division of
 
04:45:08.868 --> 04:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
policy and programs the New Hampshire
 
04:45:10.490 --> 04:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
 
04:45:12.890 --> 04:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
um I know I pale in comparison to Mr
 
04:45:14.990 --> 04:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
Roper so I will do my best to fill his
 
04:45:17.030 --> 04:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
seat while he's uh tied up with other
 
04:45:18.708 --> 04:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
things today
 
04:45:20.690 --> 04:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
um so the department is neutral on this
 
04:45:22.970 --> 04:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
bill um we did want to highlight a
 
04:45:25.430 --> 04:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
couple of things as a prime sponsor had
 
04:45:27.110 --> 04:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned on both Connecticut and Maine
 
04:45:28.910 --> 04:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
have looked at this through various
 
04:45:31.730 --> 04:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
studies certainly substantive studies in
 
04:45:33.590 --> 04:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
Maine's case it was a two-year process
 
04:45:36.530 --> 04:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
Consultants were engaged Etc so it was a
 
04:45:39.890 --> 04:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
very thorough process Connecticut went
 
04:45:42.250 --> 04:45:42.260 align:start position:0%
through a similar that was back in
 
04:45:45.470 --> 04:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
2007-2008 Connecticut did this a little
 
04:45:48.288 --> 04:45:48.298 align:start position:0%
bit more recently in the uh in 2020
 
04:45:49.850 --> 04:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
um did an analysis a little bit on the
 
04:45:52.010 --> 04:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
shorter side and I can get all these
 
04:45:53.330 --> 04:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
documents to the committee as well so
 
04:45:55.128 --> 04:45:55.138 align:start position:0%
they can review them at their Leisure
 
04:45:56.330 --> 04:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
they're quite large so I didn't bring
 
04:45:58.788 --> 04:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
copies with me here today
 
04:45:58.798 --> 04:45:59.750 align:start position:0%
copies with me here today
um

04:45:59.750 --> 04:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:01.788 --> 04:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
in anticipation of some of the questions
 
04:46:03.770 --> 04:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
at least Connecticut's uh there were
 
04:46:06.590 --> 04:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
certainly certainly uh legal issues
 
04:46:08.330 --> 04:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
um whether it's other states would be
 
04:46:08.340 --> 04:46:09.410 align:start position:0%
um whether it's other states would be
suing

04:46:09.410 --> 04:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
suing
 
04:46:11.448 --> 04:46:11.458 align:start position:0%
um if another state left
 
04:46:14.150 --> 04:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
um what happens to either Investments
 
04:46:15.470 --> 04:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
that have been made as sort of a
 
04:46:17.090 --> 04:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
regional grid
 
04:46:19.128 --> 04:46:19.138 align:start position:0%
um uh and sort of the recovery as long
 
04:46:21.230 --> 04:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
as for Investments that are made in
 
04:46:23.448 --> 04:46:23.458 align:start position:0%
other states for example if you know as
 
04:46:25.010 --> 04:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
portion of a project that was done in
 
04:46:26.208 --> 04:46:26.218 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:46:27.590 --> 04:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
um you know Connecticut rate pairs as
 
04:46:29.270 --> 04:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
being part of Vice New England paid for
 
04:46:30.948 --> 04:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
a portion of that project
 
04:46:32.330 --> 04:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
Etc so there's lots of other legal
 
04:46:34.090 --> 04:46:34.100 align:start position:0%
questions that haven't necessarily been
 
04:46:37.010 --> 04:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
adjudicated in a court of law or sort of
 
04:46:39.230 --> 04:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
make their way up whether it's at ferc
 
04:46:41.270 --> 04:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's regular a U.S District
 
04:46:43.250 --> 04:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
Court Etc
 
04:46:43.260 --> 04:46:44.150 align:start position:0%
Court Etc
um

04:46:44.150 --> 04:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:46.850 --> 04:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
so I guess there is uh if the committee
 
04:46:48.830 --> 04:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
does decide to move forward with such a
 
04:46:48.840 --> 04:46:49.730 align:start position:0%
does decide to move forward with such a
commission

04:46:49.730 --> 04:46:49.740 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:46:51.590 --> 04:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
um to realize that there's certain
 
04:46:53.390 --> 04:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
limitations again those other two
 
04:46:55.670 --> 04:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
reports engaged with Consultants it was
 
04:46:57.948 --> 04:46:57.958 align:start position:0%
a very long process because these are
 
04:46:59.690 --> 04:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
not uh there's
 
04:47:01.610 --> 04:47:01.620 align:start position:0%
they're particularly complex issues when
 
04:47:03.470 --> 04:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with uh with ISO New
 
04:47:05.750 --> 04:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
England both federal law as well as
 
04:47:07.910 --> 04:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
things where they're within ferk's
 
04:47:07.920 --> 04:47:10.550 align:start position:0%
things where they're within ferk's
jurisdiction

04:47:10.550 --> 04:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:13.490 --> 04:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
um so if you decide to move forward
 
04:47:15.110 --> 04:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
um again that is structured you could
 
04:47:17.270 --> 04:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
just do sort of a review by the by the
 
04:47:18.650 --> 04:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
folks who are named here would certainly
 
04:47:20.690 --> 04:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
be a little bit more limited in scope
 
04:47:22.250 --> 04:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
um could certainly get opinions from
 
04:47:23.990 --> 04:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
sort of outside entities as what the
 
04:47:25.788 --> 04:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
answer may be on some of those things
 
04:47:27.590 --> 04:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
but you may get conflicting information
 
04:47:29.750 --> 04:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
just because it's it's not a settled
 
04:47:29.760 --> 04:47:31.128 align:start position:0%
just because it's it's not a settled
issue

04:47:31.128 --> 04:47:31.138 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:47:31.138 --> 04:47:32.990 align:start position:0%
issue
um

04:47:32.990 --> 04:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:35.030 --> 04:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh with that
 
04:47:35.040 --> 04:47:35.570 align:start position:0%
uh with that
um

04:47:35.570 --> 04:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:37.550 --> 04:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh I am happy to take any questions
 
04:47:39.470 --> 04:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
committee may have
 
04:47:41.448 --> 04:47:41.458 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate the department
 
04:47:43.910 --> 04:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
being here to testify on this bill I
 
04:47:45.948 --> 04:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
have a quick question before I recognize
 
04:47:48.708 --> 04:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas and that is
 
04:47:52.010 --> 04:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
you said that Maine had done a study and
 
04:47:55.550 --> 04:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
it covered a two-year time span and they
 
04:47:58.250 --> 04:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
required some Consultants
 
04:48:00.110 --> 04:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
if we were to set up a similar
 
04:48:03.230 --> 04:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
commission or a commission should there
 
04:48:06.890 --> 04:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
be an appropriation of of Monies to hire
 
04:48:09.288 --> 04:48:09.298 align:start position:0%
Consultants would that be in a a
 
04:48:11.750 --> 04:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
valuable addition to the bill I think if
 
04:48:13.550 --> 04:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
you really wanted to get to the answers
 
04:48:15.230 --> 04:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
I believe the prime sponsor is listening
 
04:48:17.390 --> 04:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
is intending to answer I think that
 
04:48:18.708 --> 04:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
would probably be the best approach to
 
04:48:22.128 --> 04:48:22.138 align:start position:0%
get a substantive product at the end
 
04:48:24.170 --> 04:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Doug Thomas has
 
04:48:25.610 --> 04:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
04:48:27.410 --> 04:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm sure this will be
 
04:48:30.050 --> 04:48:30.060 align:start position:0%
answered in the course of the commission
 
04:48:32.930 --> 04:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
if if we if we had one but I'll ask you
 
04:48:36.288 --> 04:48:36.298 align:start position:0%
should we separate from the grid would
 
04:48:38.690 --> 04:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
that mean that any
 
04:48:41.090 --> 04:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
transmission projects that we have would
 
04:48:43.368 --> 04:48:43.378 align:start position:0%
have to build in in the state would
 
04:48:45.288 --> 04:48:45.298 align:start position:0%
would be fully paid for by just the
 
04:48:47.390 --> 04:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
04:48:49.788 --> 04:48:49.798 align:start position:0%
I am not a legal expert but considering
 
04:48:51.770 --> 04:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
that the only the only rate payer is at
 
04:48:53.628 --> 04:48:53.638 align:start position:0%
disposal in order to fund those projects
 
04:48:55.070 --> 04:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
would be New Hampshire rate pairs if it
 
04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
were a separate ISO
 
04:49:02.770 --> 04:49:02.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:05.628 --> 04:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
04:49:07.010 --> 04:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:49:08.628 --> 04:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned the
 
04:49:10.128 --> 04:49:10.138 align:start position:0%
main study that took place over two
 
04:49:12.170 --> 04:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
years can you just briefly give us what
 
04:49:14.628 --> 04:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
was the conclusion of that study
 
04:49:16.970 --> 04:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
um so there there are
 
04:49:18.350 --> 04:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
um it was actually done by the Maine
 
04:49:20.150 --> 04:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission so gone over
 
04:49:21.770 --> 04:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
over two years
 
04:49:23.208 --> 04:49:23.218 align:start position:0%
um I am actually waiting on the hard
 
04:49:25.430 --> 04:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
copies from the main puc to actually get
 
04:49:27.050 --> 04:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
him to be able to dig into the study
 
04:49:28.490 --> 04:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
there are references and news articles
 
04:49:29.750 --> 04:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
if you're looking around on the internet
 
04:49:31.368 --> 04:49:31.378 align:start position:0%
to find it
 
04:49:33.890 --> 04:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
um I think a lot of the discussions were
 
04:49:36.350 --> 04:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
around the complexities of actually sort
 
04:49:38.570 --> 04:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
of disentangling um they had two options
 
04:49:41.350 --> 04:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
to look at whether to set up their own
 
04:49:44.330 --> 04:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
ISO within Maine or to join with New
 
04:49:45.830 --> 04:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
Brunswick and the other Maritime
 
04:49:47.810 --> 04:49:47.820 align:start position:0%
Provinces in a grid so sort of the
 
04:49:49.070 --> 04:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
discussion was a little bit different so
 
04:49:50.208 --> 04:49:50.218 align:start position:0%
it was geared a little bit differently
 
04:49:51.830 --> 04:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
in just in terms of
 
04:49:53.390 --> 04:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
um you're adding uh an international
 
04:49:55.430 --> 04:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
Dynamic to the discussion as well
 
04:49:55.440 --> 04:49:56.930 align:start position:0%
Dynamic to the discussion as well
follow-up

04:49:56.930 --> 04:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:50:00.050 --> 04:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
follow-up but the conclusion was that it
 
04:50:01.490 --> 04:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
was not in the best interest of Maine to
 
04:50:03.350 --> 04:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
go forward with it
 
04:50:04.970 --> 04:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
I believe that was the conclusion again
 
04:50:07.010 --> 04:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
I haven't read the full report myself so
 
04:50:08.390 --> 04:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
I don't want to I don't want to cast it
 
04:50:09.830 --> 04:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
I don't want to put words in the
 
04:50:10.910 --> 04:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
report's mouth that aren't actually
 
04:50:10.920 --> 04:50:13.190 align:start position:0%
report's mouth that aren't actually
there

04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:50:15.110 --> 04:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
representative Munn says a question
 
04:50:16.970 --> 04:50:16.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:50:18.890 --> 04:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
coming back today
 
04:50:22.910 --> 04:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
um when I when I first read this bill
 
04:50:25.368 --> 04:50:25.378 align:start position:0%
the one word that came to my mind right
 
04:50:27.410 --> 04:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
away was Texas
 
04:50:30.288 --> 04:50:30.298 align:start position:0%
and the situation that they had
 
04:50:32.868 --> 04:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
um a year year and a half ago
 
04:50:32.878 --> 04:50:33.708 align:start position:0%
um a year year and a half ago
um

04:50:33.708 --> 04:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:36.830 --> 04:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
would do if we were to separate from ISO
 
04:50:38.570 --> 04:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
would that put us in a similar situation
 
04:50:41.750 --> 04:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
to Texas where they're entirely reliant
 
04:50:44.810 --> 04:50:44.820 align:start position:0%
on our own resources and not able to get
 
04:50:49.070 --> 04:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:51.890 --> 04:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
I think the state would benefit from
 
04:50:53.990 --> 04:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
having the existing infrastructure that
 
04:50:55.550 --> 04:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
currently exists today and being able to
 
04:50:57.708 --> 04:50:57.718 align:start position:0%
move power back and forth um whether
 
04:50:58.610 --> 04:50:58.620 align:start position:0%
it's you're going through another
 
04:51:01.010 --> 04:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
regulatory entity in between ISO New
 
04:51:04.128 --> 04:51:04.138 align:start position:0%
England and in theory New Hampshire
 
04:51:04.138 --> 04:51:06.470 align:start position:0%
England and in theory New Hampshire
um

04:51:06.470 --> 04:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:08.570 --> 04:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
best to say I don't know I imagine again
 
04:51:10.250 --> 04:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
I imagine we're not deconstructing any
 
04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
of the existing infrastructure so we'd
 
04:51:14.090 --> 04:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
still be able to advance be able to use
 
04:51:15.708 --> 04:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
that to what extent we would be able to
 
04:51:17.810 --> 04:51:17.820 align:start position:0%
use it at what cost if we were a
 
04:51:17.820 --> 04:51:19.128 align:start position:0%
use it at what cost if we were a
separate

04:51:19.128 --> 04:51:19.138 align:start position:0%
separate
 
04:51:24.170 --> 04:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
um uh a separate ISO I don't know
 
04:51:26.208 --> 04:51:26.218 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:51:28.730 --> 04:51:28.740 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
um I'd like some clarification please if
 
04:51:34.190 --> 04:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
I um if if New Hampshire left the energy
 
04:51:37.368 --> 04:51:37.378 align:start position:0%
grid and I am an energy generator does
 
04:51:39.770 --> 04:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
this dictate who I could sell my product
 
04:51:39.780 --> 04:51:41.390 align:start position:0%
this dictate who I could sell my product
to

04:51:41.390 --> 04:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:51:43.128 --> 04:51:43.138 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so because those
 
04:51:45.050 --> 04:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
generators have existing contracts
 
04:51:46.788 --> 04:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
either I think someone had mentioned
 
04:51:48.650 --> 04:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
with Seabrook um having contracts with
 
04:51:48.660 --> 04:51:50.090 align:start position:0%
with Seabrook um having contracts with
Connecticut

04:51:50.090 --> 04:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
Connecticut
 
04:51:51.650 --> 04:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
um as well as if they have contracts
 
04:51:52.970 --> 04:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
with other
 
04:51:54.830 --> 04:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
um either utilities or other entities
 
04:51:56.990 --> 04:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
for electricity I don't think this would
 
04:51:58.070 --> 04:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
in any way
 
04:51:59.570 --> 04:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
avoid them
 
04:52:01.610 --> 04:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
um again I am not a contracts expert or
 
04:52:03.288 --> 04:52:03.298 align:start position:0%
an attorney but I I can't imagine that
 
04:52:04.610 --> 04:52:04.620 align:start position:0%
being in a separate group would void
 
04:52:06.830 --> 04:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
those contracts in any way
 
04:52:08.930 --> 04:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
but I I don't know that to be to be
 
04:52:11.868 --> 04:52:11.878 align:start position:0%
certain follow-up follow-up so does this
 
04:52:13.850 --> 04:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
mean that that even if we left the grid
 
04:52:15.948 --> 04:52:15.958 align:start position:0%
I would I could if I chose to I could
 
04:52:20.628 --> 04:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
still benefit from from the grid
 
04:52:23.448 --> 04:52:23.458 align:start position:0%
you would still as far as selling my
 
04:52:25.070 --> 04:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
product Oh and started selling your
 
04:52:26.868 --> 04:52:26.878 align:start position:0%
product yes if you are a generation in
 
04:52:28.610 --> 04:52:28.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and you just you know you
 
04:52:30.948 --> 04:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
decide to bid in for default service out
 
04:52:33.470 --> 04:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
of a utility in Massachusetts yes you'd
 
04:52:35.510 --> 04:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
still be able to do that now what those
 
04:52:37.310 --> 04:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
tariffs look like for using other
 
04:52:38.810 --> 04:52:38.820 align:start position:0%
infrastructure I don't know because then
 
04:52:40.250 --> 04:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
it would depend on what ISO New England
 
04:52:42.770 --> 04:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
would do sort of in response in terms of
 
04:52:44.628 --> 04:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
power moving back and forth okay thank
 
04:52:46.010 --> 04:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
04:52:48.830 --> 04:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
04:52:50.570 --> 04:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:52:52.010 --> 04:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:52:53.270 --> 04:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little surprised to hear that
 
04:52:55.670 --> 04:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
Doe is neutral on this bill is that
 
04:52:57.470 --> 04:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
because you actually weighed pros and
 
04:52:59.868 --> 04:52:59.878 align:start position:0%
cons and just couldn't conclude or is it
 
04:53:03.708 --> 04:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
that DOA really wishes to not weigh in
 
04:53:05.330 --> 04:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
um I would say generally speaking when
 
04:53:07.190 --> 04:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
it comes to study committee committees
 
04:53:08.510 --> 04:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
and commissions usually the department
 
04:53:10.190 --> 04:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't take a position one way or the
 
04:53:12.050 --> 04:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
other if it's a something that the
 
04:53:14.030 --> 04:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
legislature wishes to look at um we
 
04:53:15.170 --> 04:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
don't really think it's the Department's
 
04:53:16.368 --> 04:53:16.378 align:start position:0%
business to tell you whether or not you
 
04:53:20.690 --> 04:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:23.390 --> 04:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has a question
 
04:53:26.330 --> 04:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
thank you this is a follow-up on uh
 
04:53:28.128 --> 04:53:28.138 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas's question
 
04:53:31.310 --> 04:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
about paying for transmission costs so
 
04:53:33.530 --> 04:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
do the other states help us pay for our
 
04:53:35.390 --> 04:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
transmission costs now or is it the
 
04:53:37.430 --> 04:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
other way around and have a follow-up
 
04:53:40.250 --> 04:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
yes um so think of it sort of like the
 
04:53:41.570 --> 04:53:41.580 align:start position:0%
maybe this isn't the best committee but
 
04:53:43.310 --> 04:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
the highway fund right if I'm going and
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
paying for gas here in Concord a portion
 
04:53:47.208 --> 04:53:47.218 align:start position:0%
of that you know we'll go to pay a reap
 
04:53:48.770 --> 04:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
repave a road up in Pittsburgh even
 
04:53:50.270 --> 04:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
though I've never driven on Route 3 in
 
04:53:52.190 --> 04:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh yet
 
04:53:55.250 --> 04:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
um you know my my uh road toll Revenue
 
04:53:57.170 --> 04:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
goes to help pay for those roads not
 
04:53:58.550 --> 04:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
just the roads that I in particular use
 
04:54:00.230 --> 04:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
so it's the same sort of basic concept
 
04:54:02.570 --> 04:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
however the way that it's allocated
 
04:54:04.910 --> 04:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
among all of the states
 
04:54:06.470 --> 04:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
um in terms of if there is a if there's
 
04:54:08.270 --> 04:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
a large project being done that falls
 
04:54:09.948 --> 04:54:09.958 align:start position:0%
within those jurisdictions for
 
04:54:09.958 --> 04:54:11.390 align:start position:0%
within those jurisdictions for
Interstate

04:54:11.390 --> 04:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
Interstate
 
04:54:11.400 --> 04:54:12.650 align:start position:0%
Interstate
um

04:54:12.650 --> 04:54:12.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:14.330 --> 04:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
um as part of iso New England is a large
 
04:54:16.310 --> 04:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
larger transmission project or a larger
 
04:54:19.250 --> 04:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
reliability project costs are allocated
 
04:54:23.570 --> 04:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
by a percentage of the state's load in
 
04:54:25.670 --> 04:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
the New England grid so for example New
 
04:54:27.530 --> 04:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire accounts for roughly between
 
04:54:29.750 --> 04:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
depending on when you count between nine
 
04:54:32.150 --> 04:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
and ten percent of the load of all of
 
04:54:33.770 --> 04:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
New England as a whole
 
04:54:36.110 --> 04:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
um therefore New Hampshire uh New
 
04:54:37.670 --> 04:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rate payers share of any of
 
04:54:41.030 --> 04:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
those large transmission projects come
 
04:54:43.010 --> 04:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
to eight or nine or excuse me nine or
 
04:54:44.390 --> 04:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
ten percent of whatever that total
 
04:54:48.410 --> 04:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
project is follow up follow up so I was
 
04:54:50.448 --> 04:54:50.458 align:start position:0%
wondering if it was um if it's all fair
 
04:54:52.250 --> 04:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
and even or is New Hampshire the cash
 
04:54:53.990 --> 04:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
cow right now for
 
04:54:56.448 --> 04:54:56.458 align:start position:0%
um ISO New England uh yeah so it's all
 
04:54:58.010 --> 04:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
it's all based on whatever the
 
04:55:00.170 --> 04:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
percentage of of electricity usage or
 
04:55:02.510 --> 04:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
load that is uh excuse me electricity
 
04:55:04.250 --> 04:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
that is consumed by each of the states
 
04:55:06.708 --> 04:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
so it's basically you know if we we
 
04:55:08.810 --> 04:55:08.820 align:start position:0%
account for about 10 of it we're uh we
 
04:55:10.610 --> 04:55:10.620 align:start position:0%
have to pay in New Hampshire repairs are
 
04:55:12.288 --> 04:55:12.298 align:start position:0%
responsible for 10 of whatever the cost
 
04:55:14.208 --> 04:55:14.218 align:start position:0%
is even if it's a project that's in
 
04:55:16.368 --> 04:55:16.378 align:start position:0%
Connecticut or Rhode Island Vermont or
 
04:55:16.378 --> 04:55:19.250 align:start position:0%
Connecticut or Rhode Island Vermont or
Maine

04:55:19.250 --> 04:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:22.250 --> 04:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative Kaplan has
 
04:55:23.690 --> 04:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
a question
 
04:55:25.850 --> 04:55:25.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um as somebody who
 
04:55:28.910 --> 04:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
does strategy planning for for the state
 
04:55:30.410 --> 04:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that the transmission
 
04:55:32.448 --> 04:55:32.458 align:start position:0%
infrastructure at the present seems
 
04:55:35.208 --> 04:55:35.218 align:start position:0%
pretty uh decent for us and I'm assuming
 
04:55:37.490 --> 04:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
the generation capacities you would say
 
04:55:39.650 --> 04:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
the same thing but what about 10 years
 
04:55:42.530 --> 04:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
down the road you know the fuel mix is
 
04:55:44.208 --> 04:55:44.218 align:start position:0%
changing the generation mix is changing
 
04:55:45.530 --> 04:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
the transmission needs will change
 
04:55:48.110 --> 04:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be wiser to be able to cast
 
04:55:51.410 --> 04:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
from a wider net of resources rather
 
04:55:53.570 --> 04:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
than restrict ourselves to what we can
 
04:55:55.310 --> 04:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
produce and what we can do in the state
 
04:55:57.050 --> 04:55:57.060 align:start position:0%
and that's for everything from raising
 
04:55:58.970 --> 04:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
money to pay for projects to generating
 
04:56:00.948 --> 04:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
to transmitting to administering to
 
04:56:03.530 --> 04:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
marketing to procuring wouldn't it be
 
04:56:10.128 --> 04:56:10.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:12.050 --> 04:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
trying to think of how to answer that um
 
04:56:14.150 --> 04:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
as being part of a larger entity there
 
04:56:16.490 --> 04:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
are certainly uh you know pluses and
 
04:56:18.170 --> 04:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
minuses of being able to sort of have
 
04:56:19.730 --> 04:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
those economies of scale that you
 
04:56:19.740 --> 04:56:21.050 align:start position:0%
those economies of scale that you
mentioned

04:56:21.050 --> 04:56:21.060 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
04:56:22.610 --> 04:56:22.620 align:start position:0%
um certainly ISO New England is looking
 
04:56:24.110 --> 04:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
at a variety of different things I know
 
04:56:25.970 --> 04:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
they came and presented a few weeks ago
 
04:56:25.980 --> 04:56:27.170 align:start position:0%
they came and presented a few weeks ago
here

04:56:27.170 --> 04:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:56:29.090 --> 04:56:29.100 align:start position:0%
um you know certainly transmission is
 
04:56:30.170 --> 04:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
one of those things we have a pretty
 
04:56:32.510 --> 04:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
reliable uh transmission infrastructure
 
04:56:34.128 --> 04:56:34.138 align:start position:0%
and that's from having made large
 
04:56:36.368 --> 04:56:36.378 align:start position:0%
Investments over the last 10 or 15 years
 
04:56:39.590 --> 04:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
into that Network that's probably only
 
04:56:42.288 --> 04:56:42.298 align:start position:0%
going to grow as we further incorporate
 
04:56:44.288 --> 04:56:44.298 align:start position:0%
renewable Technologies into the grid
 
04:56:46.490 --> 04:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
based on they're very site-specific you
 
04:56:48.110 --> 04:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
can't just drop you know solar panels
 
04:56:49.610 --> 04:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
anywhere in particular or wind turbines
 
04:56:50.628 --> 04:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
they have to be you know you have to
 
04:56:51.830 --> 04:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
want to put them in places where they
 
04:56:54.230 --> 04:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
have the best capacity factors so with
 
04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
that you would have the additional
 
04:56:57.230 --> 04:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
transmission capacity that would be
 
04:56:59.990 --> 04:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
needed to move that move that generation
 
04:57:02.810 --> 04:57:02.820 align:start position:0%
Supply to where the demand is
 
04:57:04.430 --> 04:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
um so I suppose that's a very roundabout
 
04:57:05.868 --> 04:57:05.878 align:start position:0%
way of not really answering your
 
04:57:12.410 --> 04:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:16.250 --> 04:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions I want
 
04:57:17.990 --> 04:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
to thank you for your testimony here
 
04:57:19.610 --> 04:57:19.620 align:start position:0%
this afternoon we appreciate it thank
 
04:57:21.948 --> 04:57:21.958 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chairman
 
04:57:25.788 --> 04:57:25.798 align:start position:0%
all right we'll now move to the last
 
04:57:28.850 --> 04:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
person who has signed up to testify and
 
04:57:30.590 --> 04:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
I'll alert anybody sitting out there
 
04:57:32.330 --> 04:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
that if you want to testify I need to
 
04:57:34.610 --> 04:57:34.620 align:start position:0%
see a pink card from you please
 
04:57:37.070 --> 04:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
but uh in any case right now we will
 
04:57:39.288 --> 04:57:39.298 align:start position:0%
hear from Mr William Hall who's from
 
04:57:48.050 --> 04:57:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:50.750 --> 04:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman boss
 
04:57:53.090 --> 04:57:53.100 align:start position:0%
um I saw this and it kind of scared me
 
04:57:54.770 --> 04:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
now I'll tell you why
 
04:57:57.470 --> 04:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
we recently had a proposal here before
 
04:58:00.110 --> 04:58:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's been discussed this year where they
 
04:58:01.970 --> 04:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
wanted to Outsource emissions
 
04:58:05.030 --> 04:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
legislation to California bypassing the
 
04:58:08.868 --> 04:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
missions uh for chain bypassing the
 
04:58:11.150 --> 04:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
legislative processes here when changes
 
04:58:13.128 --> 04:58:13.138 align:start position:0%
happen in California I wasn't very
 
04:58:14.948 --> 04:58:14.958 align:start position:0%
impressed with that
 
04:58:18.708 --> 04:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire house
 
04:58:21.590 --> 04:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
chose to bankrupt the power company
 
04:58:24.650 --> 04:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
to stop Seabrook
 
04:58:27.590 --> 04:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
when you have the people that want to do
 
04:58:30.170 --> 04:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing that cost the
 
04:58:32.448 --> 04:58:32.458 align:start position:0%
stockholders the rate payers the rate
 
04:58:34.430 --> 04:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
payers over two two thousand dollars a
 
04:58:38.208 --> 04:58:38.218 align:start position:0%
person a couple of million bucks uh just
 
04:58:41.150 --> 04:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
so that you can play Jane Fonda and stop
 
04:58:43.610 --> 04:58:43.620 align:start position:0%
a nuke plant they stopped one but they
 
04:58:45.788 --> 04:58:45.798 align:start position:0%
didn't stop the other so when you have
 
04:58:49.850 --> 04:58:49.860 align:start position:0%
Mischief Mischief people like that in
 
04:58:53.030 --> 04:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
your system I I get very nervous
 
04:58:53.040 --> 04:58:54.110 align:start position:0%
your system I I get very nervous
um

04:58:54.110 --> 04:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:57.670 --> 04:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
we had a proposal to bring down clean
 
04:59:01.310 --> 04:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
Hydro transmission electrical
 
04:59:03.110 --> 04:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
transmission from Canada
 
04:59:05.570 --> 04:59:05.580 align:start position:0%
that was opposed by one of the parties
 
04:59:07.850 --> 04:59:07.860 align:start position:0%
and one of the candidates for Governor
 
04:59:11.270 --> 04:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
was this and it's got was stopped I know
 
04:59:14.288 --> 04:59:14.298 align:start position:0%
that uh a confirm in Boston that was
 
04:59:18.470 --> 04:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
hired to evaluate the uh what it would
 
04:59:20.810 --> 04:59:20.820 align:start position:0%
do to the property values their initial
 
04:59:23.390 --> 04:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
report said nothing and all of a sudden
 
04:59:27.050 --> 04:59:27.060 align:start position:0%
the contract was unfunded and died
 
04:59:27.060 --> 04:59:29.050 align:start position:0%
the contract was unfunded and died
um

04:59:29.050 --> 04:59:29.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:33.470 --> 04:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
more Healy in our ads said that she'd
 
04:59:36.110 --> 04:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
stop two pipelines okay that's why
 
04:59:38.208 --> 04:59:38.218 align:start position:0%
electricity cost us 30 cents a kilowatt
 
04:59:38.218 --> 04:59:40.368 align:start position:0%
electricity cost us 30 cents a kilowatt
now

04:59:40.368 --> 04:59:40.378 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:59:46.128 --> 04:59:46.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:48.350 --> 04:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
our delegation to Washington didn't
 
04:59:52.550 --> 04:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:54.948 --> 04:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
whoops I forgot to press my button if I
 
04:59:56.690 --> 04:59:56.700 align:start position:0%
could just interrupt you for a second we
 
04:59:59.150 --> 04:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
don't typically name individuals oh
 
05:00:01.550 --> 05:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
sorry in this committee one we I'm sorry
 
05:00:04.368 --> 05:00:04.378 align:start position:0%
entertain testimony all right our
 
05:00:07.070 --> 05:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
delegation to Washington uh chose not to
 
05:00:09.110 --> 05:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
back our governor and the other five
 
05:00:11.810 --> 05:00:11.820 align:start position:0%
governors in New England to
 
05:00:14.628 --> 05:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
um uh in their letter from last July
 
05:00:17.448 --> 05:00:17.458 align:start position:0%
saying how we could avoid this price
 
05:00:19.610 --> 05:00:19.620 align:start position:0%
increase and what we had to do and do it
 
05:00:19.620 --> 05:00:20.990 align:start position:0%
increase and what we had to do and do it
quickly

05:00:20.990 --> 05:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
05:00:21.000 --> 05:00:21.770 align:start position:0%
quickly
um

05:00:21.770 --> 05:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:26.150 --> 05:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
the uh subsequent letter from from uh
 
05:00:29.448 --> 05:00:29.458 align:start position:0%
the Energy Secretary uh said we're on
 
05:00:34.368 --> 05:00:34.378 align:start position:0%
our own and uh uh then uh the head of
 
05:00:36.830 --> 05:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
eversource for New England wrote a very
 
05:00:39.050 --> 05:00:39.060 align:start position:0%
good letter with a number of bullet
 
05:00:41.208 --> 05:00:41.218 align:start position:0%
items on it about what we could do to
 
05:00:45.288 --> 05:00:45.298 align:start position:0%
keep our power our costs down and uh
 
05:00:46.850 --> 05:00:46.860 align:start position:0%
once again
 
05:00:49.670 --> 05:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
um that letter has not been supported in
 
05:00:52.970 --> 05:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
my opinion uh politically uh other than
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
uh the governor uh as to
 
05:00:56.638 --> 05:00:57.250 align:start position:0%
uh the governor uh as to
um

05:00:57.250 --> 05:00:57.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:00.650 --> 05:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
uh trying to implement those things are
 
05:01:02.570 --> 05:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you've seen it but if
 
05:01:04.610 --> 05:01:04.620 align:start position:0%
you haven't seen that letter it's three
 
05:01:08.390 --> 05:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
pages and half a page of circulation
 
05:01:08.400 --> 05:01:10.490 align:start position:0%
pages and half a page of circulation
um

05:01:10.490 --> 05:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:13.730 --> 05:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
the the only way that we're going to
 
05:01:16.910 --> 05:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
move forward and have clean Renewable
 
05:01:21.230 --> 05:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
Power is uh with either Hydro or nuclear
 
05:01:24.050 --> 05:01:24.060 align:start position:0%
and at the rate we're going uh we're not
 
05:01:26.390 --> 05:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
going to get another nuclear plant we've
 
05:01:28.788 --> 05:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
got a hundred nuclear plants that are
 
05:01:30.410 --> 05:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
going to go offline in the next few
 
05:01:33.470 --> 05:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
years and this country needs about 200
 
05:01:35.390 --> 05:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
so we should start building them right
 
05:01:39.050 --> 05:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
away I'm opposed to this because I I
 
05:01:40.550 --> 05:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
think that there are other things we
 
05:01:42.770 --> 05:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
could be doing that would be far more
 
05:01:45.708 --> 05:01:45.718 align:start position:0%
productive thank you okay thank you very
 
05:01:52.030 --> 05:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:54.890 --> 05:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for being here and
 
05:01:58.128 --> 05:01:58.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:01.190 --> 05:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
is there anyone in the
 
05:02:04.368 --> 05:02:04.378 align:start position:0%
assembled audience that would like to
 
05:02:08.510 --> 05:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:11.628 --> 05:02:11.638 align:start position:0%
apparently not looks like I have
 
05:02:13.788 --> 05:02:13.798 align:start position:0%
badly underestimated the amount of
 
05:02:17.690 --> 05:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
reaction that this would Bill generate I
 
05:02:19.368 --> 05:02:19.378 align:start position:0%
expected we'd hear something from the
 
05:02:21.830 --> 05:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
utilities but apparently not
 
05:02:25.010 --> 05:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
so we now find ourselves with a lot of
 
05:02:26.208 --> 05:02:26.218 align:start position:0%
time to kill
 
05:02:29.448 --> 05:02:29.458 align:start position:0%
between now and the time of the next
 
05:02:33.530 --> 05:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:37.910 --> 05:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
so it looks like we're going to get some
 
05:02:41.868 --> 05:02:41.878 align:start position:0%
unexpected vacation time and uh
 
05:02:43.550 --> 05:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm going to close the
 
05:02:47.930 --> 05:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 443
 
05:02:52.010 --> 05:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
and ask Tom closure to tell us what the
 
05:02:55.550 --> 05:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:59.390 --> 05:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
thank you on House Bill 443 the blue
 
05:03:02.030 --> 05:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
sheet was one in favor
 
05:03:03.590 --> 05:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
Two Against
 
05:03:06.708 --> 05:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
on line four in favor
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
44 against
 
05:03:11.750 --> 05:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
05:03:14.690 --> 05:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
so I guess you'll have to entertain
 
05:03:16.970 --> 05:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
yourselves for the next 55 minutes and
 
06:01:00.230 --> 06:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:02.930 --> 06:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry for the delay
 
06:01:05.570 --> 06:01:05.580 align:start position:0%
but it is now three o'clock according to
 
06:01:07.548 --> 06:01:07.558 align:start position:0%
my whiz-bang device here
 
06:01:10.010 --> 06:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to open the public hearing
 
06:01:12.250 --> 06:01:12.260 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 630
 
06:01:14.448 --> 06:01:14.458 align:start position:0%
establishing a revolving clean energy
 
06:01:16.548 --> 06:01:16.558 align:start position:0%
accelerator Fund in the department of
 
06:01:19.070 --> 06:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
energy and called the prime sponsor of
 
06:01:20.868 --> 06:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
the build representative Rebecca
 
06:01:24.650 --> 06:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
McWilliams to introduce the bill
 
06:01:32.750 --> 06:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:32.760 --> 06:01:33.890 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:01:33.890 --> 06:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:01:38.448 --> 06:01:38.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:52.250 --> 06:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:54.530 --> 06:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
while Ms McWilliams is getting ready
 
06:01:56.510 --> 06:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
I'll remind everyone here that if you
 
06:01:58.490 --> 06:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
want to
 
06:02:00.650 --> 06:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
talk about this bill to the committee we
 
06:02:02.868 --> 06:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
ask that you fill out a pink card and
 
06:02:05.750 --> 06:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
submit it to us as soon as possible
 
06:02:10.788 --> 06:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:13.970 --> 06:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
and with that representative McWilliams
 
06:02:16.070 --> 06:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
is now ready and we'll introduce this
 
06:02:16.080 --> 06:02:20.868 align:start position:0%
is now ready and we'll introduce this
legislation

06:02:20.868 --> 06:02:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:23.208 --> 06:02:23.218 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Bose colleagues on the
 
06:02:24.770 --> 06:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
06:02:26.270 --> 06:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Rebecca
 
06:02:28.610 --> 06:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
McWilliams I'm a state rep for South
 
06:02:31.970 --> 06:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
Concord Wards 5678 it's my pleasure to
 
06:02:33.288 --> 06:02:33.298 align:start position:0%
join you it's been a pleasure to be with
 
06:02:35.170 --> 06:02:35.180 align:start position:0%
you all day today
 
06:02:39.288 --> 06:02:39.298 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about the big numbers
 
06:02:40.868 --> 06:02:40.878 align:start position:0%
the big number
 
06:02:45.890 --> 06:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
27 billion B 27 billion dollars
 
06:02:48.350 --> 06:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
committed by the Fed
 
06:02:50.390 --> 06:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
so those are our tax dollars that went
 
06:02:51.890 --> 06:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire and all the tax
 
06:02:54.110 --> 06:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
dollars from everyone else and all the
 
06:02:56.868 --> 06:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
states paying taxes to the fed and we
 
06:02:58.970 --> 06:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
sure would like to get some of that 27
 
06:03:01.970 --> 06:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
billion back here in order to do good
 
06:03:04.490 --> 06:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
things with it so
 
06:03:07.490 --> 06:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
let me pull up
 
06:03:10.850 --> 06:03:10.860 align:start position:0%
a little bit more about what's going on
 
06:03:10.860 --> 06:03:14.448 align:start position:0%
a little bit more about what's going on
um

06:03:14.448 --> 06:03:14.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:17.510 --> 06:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
all right so this bill um House Bill 630
 
06:03:20.868 --> 06:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
is a revolving energy fund also known as
 
06:03:23.690 --> 06:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
a green Bank the terms are used somewhat
 
06:03:25.250 --> 06:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
interchangeably so when I say green Bank
 
06:03:27.288 --> 06:03:27.298 align:start position:0%
I'm also saying uh revolving clean
 
06:03:29.208 --> 06:03:29.218 align:start position:0%
energy fund just to be very clear
 
06:03:31.368 --> 06:03:31.378 align:start position:0%
because the funding from the FED is
 
06:03:32.810 --> 06:03:32.820 align:start position:0%
specific to Green Banks and that's what
 
06:03:35.048 --> 06:03:35.058 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do with this bill
 
06:03:37.910 --> 06:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
currently there are 23 Green Banks in
 
06:03:39.410 --> 06:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
the United States although more are
 
06:03:41.930 --> 06:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
being created these are all members of
 
06:03:44.868 --> 06:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
the American Green Bank Consortium
 
06:03:46.490 --> 06:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
um it's a program of the Coalition for
 
06:03:48.288 --> 06:03:48.298 align:start position:0%
green Capital which creates and supports
 
06:03:50.628 --> 06:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
Green Banks leading to charge and create
 
06:03:52.490 --> 06:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
a national green Bank Green Banks have
 
06:03:55.128 --> 06:03:55.138 align:start position:0%
mobilized 9 billion with a B dollars in
 
06:03:56.628 --> 06:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
overall green investment over the past
 
06:04:00.590 --> 06:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
10 years using only 2 billion in public
 
06:04:02.690 --> 06:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
funds so you're seeing that's a
 
06:04:04.190 --> 06:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
significant return on investment you
 
06:04:05.628 --> 06:04:05.638 align:start position:0%
start with 2 billion and you turn it
 
06:04:07.850 --> 06:04:07.860 align:start position:0%
into 9 billion in terms of projects
 
06:04:07.860 --> 06:04:09.650 align:start position:0%
into 9 billion in terms of projects
completed

06:04:09.650 --> 06:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
completed
 
06:04:12.048 --> 06:04:12.058 align:start position:0%
um Green Banks are mission driven
 
06:04:15.708 --> 06:04:15.718 align:start position:0%
so despite the name Bank in the title
 
06:04:18.890 --> 06:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
Green Bank they don't take deposits so
 
06:04:21.170 --> 06:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
you can't decide to get a debit card and
 
06:04:23.090 --> 06:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
create a checking account and join the
 
06:04:25.970 --> 06:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
green Bank as an individual they
 
06:04:28.310 --> 06:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
function like loan or investment funds
 
06:04:31.208 --> 06:04:31.218 align:start position:0%
so they use all kinds of financial tools
 
06:04:33.708 --> 06:04:33.718 align:start position:0%
they differ in governance from state to
 
06:04:35.628 --> 06:04:35.638 align:start position:0%
state some are fully public some are
 
06:04:38.270 --> 06:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
quasi-public right PPP public private
 
06:04:39.830 --> 06:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
partnership we really like doing those
 
06:04:42.410 --> 06:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
around here and some are fully
 
06:04:44.150 --> 06:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
independent with no government oversight
 
06:04:47.090 --> 06:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
or ties to the state so the goal of
 
06:04:48.288 --> 06:04:48.298 align:start position:0%
green bank is to be financially
 
06:04:50.270 --> 06:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
sustainable but they're not about
 
06:04:52.430 --> 06:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
maximizing profit they are mission
 
06:04:52.440 --> 06:04:54.410 align:start position:0%
maximizing profit they are mission
driven

06:04:54.410 --> 06:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
driven
 
06:04:56.390 --> 06:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
um so how does the IRA support Green
 
06:04:58.128 --> 06:04:58.138 align:start position:0%
Banks we're talking about the inflation
 
06:05:01.128 --> 06:05:01.138 align:start position:0%
reduction act all that Federal money 27
 
06:05:04.010 --> 06:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
billion dollars they've made two buckets
 
06:05:06.910 --> 06:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
the first bucket
 
06:05:11.150 --> 06:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
is a grant program for the greenhouse
 
06:05:14.690 --> 06:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
gas reduction fund ghgrf that allocates
 
06:05:17.930 --> 06:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
27 billion to the EPA to make grants
 
06:05:20.990 --> 06:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
7 billion this is the small bucket
 
06:05:23.090 --> 06:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
is accessible directly to cities and
 
06:05:25.610 --> 06:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
states so your municipality or the state
 
06:05:28.070 --> 06:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire can provide financial
 
06:05:30.650 --> 06:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
support support to do zero emissions
 
06:05:33.350 --> 06:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
Technologies to low-income and
 
06:05:35.270 --> 06:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged areas
 
06:05:38.448 --> 06:05:38.458 align:start position:0%
then 20 billion big bucket
 
06:05:40.910 --> 06:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
is accessible to non-profit entities
 
06:05:44.030 --> 06:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
that have the qualities of a green bank
 
06:05:46.548 --> 06:05:46.558 align:start position:0%
which um obviously the inflation
 
06:05:48.650 --> 06:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
reduction act has a lot of checklist
 
06:05:50.570 --> 06:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
criteria on that
 
06:05:54.048 --> 06:05:54.058 align:start position:0%
um so recipients of the 20 billion must
 
06:05:56.690 --> 06:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
engage in both direct investment in
 
06:05:59.810 --> 06:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
projects and indirect investment in
 
06:06:01.368 --> 06:06:01.378 align:start position:0%
state and local institutions that are
 
06:06:03.110 --> 06:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
doing Mission aligned work at the state
 
06:06:05.750 --> 06:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
local and National levels
 
06:06:07.610 --> 06:06:07.620 align:start position:0%
um so really what I've created in this
 
06:06:09.948 --> 06:06:09.958 align:start position:0%
legislation is a vehicle to receive
 
06:06:12.708 --> 06:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
funding in the form of monies from the
 
06:06:14.390 --> 06:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
FED as part of the inflation reduction
 
06:06:16.430 --> 06:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
act you're going to hear from people
 
06:06:19.548 --> 06:06:19.558 align:start position:0%
after me who have very specific nuances
 
06:06:21.890 --> 06:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
they'd like to change with this bill I
 
06:06:23.810 --> 06:06:23.820 align:start position:0%
am completely open to amending this bill
 
06:06:26.510 --> 06:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
to make it work for our state my goal is
 
06:06:27.948 --> 06:06:27.958 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this money comes back
 
06:06:29.690 --> 06:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire and that we don't allow
 
06:06:31.610 --> 06:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
it to go to some other state instead we
 
06:06:33.730 --> 06:06:33.740 align:start position:0%
lose the monies that New Hampshire
 
06:06:36.288 --> 06:06:36.298 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have given to the fed and so
 
06:06:38.448 --> 06:06:38.458 align:start position:0%
we don't get them back my goal here is
 
06:06:41.510 --> 06:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
to create that vessel to receive the
 
06:06:41.520 --> 06:06:42.350 align:start position:0%
to create that vessel to receive the
money

06:06:42.350 --> 06:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
06:06:44.930 --> 06:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
um and so certainly if we need to talk
 
06:06:47.448 --> 06:06:47.458 align:start position:0%
about hosting it in a different agency
 
06:06:49.010 --> 06:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
or Department that's not the department
 
06:06:51.110 --> 06:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
of energy I'm open to that
 
06:06:52.910 --> 06:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
if we need to talk about specific
 
06:06:55.310 --> 06:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
Financial vehicles for how this works
 
06:06:57.948 --> 06:06:57.958 align:start position:0%
with our local banking institutions I'm
 
06:07:00.110 --> 06:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
open to that and if we need to talk
 
06:07:02.628 --> 06:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
about specific targets and goals that
 
06:07:04.190 --> 06:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
the state would like to have to earmark
 
06:07:06.770 --> 06:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
the funds in regards to what the FED
 
06:07:08.448 --> 06:07:08.458 align:start position:0%
wants us to do and what we as a state
 
06:07:10.548 --> 06:07:10.558 align:start position:0%
want to do in terms of our long-term
 
06:07:13.368 --> 06:07:13.378 align:start position:0%
planning I'm open to that as well so
 
06:07:16.190 --> 06:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
really this is this is a
 
06:07:19.070 --> 06:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
present wrapped up and it's going to get
 
06:07:20.868 --> 06:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
lots of money in it if we can figure out
 
06:07:22.310 --> 06:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
how to work together and make it work
 
06:07:24.048 --> 06:07:24.058 align:start position:0%
for the state so I'm happy to take
 
06:07:26.090 --> 06:07:26.100 align:start position:0%
questions about this and I know there
 
06:07:27.230 --> 06:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
are quite a few other folks who'd like
 
06:07:30.830 --> 06:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:33.590 --> 06:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Mick
 
06:07:35.990 --> 06:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
Williams for introducing this bill
 
06:07:38.990 --> 06:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
06:07:40.788 --> 06:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
06:07:42.830 --> 06:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
my question so
 
06:07:42.840 --> 06:07:43.490 align:start position:0%
my question so
um

06:07:43.490 --> 06:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:45.470 --> 06:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sure others may be able to explain
 
06:07:47.150 --> 06:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
this later on but I'm a little bit
 
06:07:49.670 --> 06:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
confused am I to understand that this
 
06:07:49.680 --> 06:07:50.510 align:start position:0%
confused am I to understand that this
bill

06:07:50.510 --> 06:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:07:53.150 --> 06:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
basically just says
 
06:07:56.208 --> 06:07:56.218 align:start position:0%
let's establish a bank
 
06:07:58.990 --> 06:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
without any
 
06:08:03.770 --> 06:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
limits rules any Mission any degree of
 
06:08:05.750 --> 06:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
Direction uh
 
06:08:08.030 --> 06:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
you're basically saying let's let's do
 
06:08:10.070 --> 06:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
something let's put it into law and then
 
06:08:12.890 --> 06:08:12.900 align:start position:0%
let's decide what to do with it that
 
06:08:14.990 --> 06:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of what I'm hearing
 
06:08:17.208 --> 06:08:17.218 align:start position:0%
when you say that you're open to that
 
06:08:19.368 --> 06:08:19.378 align:start position:0%
this is open to anything you want to do
 
06:08:21.770 --> 06:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
with it I'm I'm I'm kind of confused
 
06:08:24.170 --> 06:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
about that can you expand on that thank
 
06:08:25.970 --> 06:08:25.980 align:start position:0%
you representative Doug Thomas I'm sorry
 
06:08:28.368 --> 06:08:28.378 align:start position:0%
if you're confused let me tone it back a
 
06:08:29.930 --> 06:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
little bit because I get so excited
 
06:08:31.548 --> 06:08:31.558 align:start position:0%
about getting money back for New
 
06:08:34.010 --> 06:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is exciting to me
 
06:08:38.570 --> 06:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
let's say that within the criteria of
 
06:08:40.548 --> 06:08:40.558 align:start position:0%
the inflation reduction act there are
 
06:08:42.530 --> 06:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
certain check boxes that we must check
 
06:08:44.750 --> 06:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
in order to receive the funds right no
 
06:08:46.310 --> 06:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
federal funds come without strings
 
06:08:46.320 --> 06:08:47.570 align:start position:0%
federal funds come without strings
attached

06:08:47.570 --> 06:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
attached
 
06:08:50.570 --> 06:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
so if we can check the boxes then we
 
06:08:52.970 --> 06:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
still have latitude as a state to have
 
06:08:55.070 --> 06:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
priorities and determine exactly how the
 
06:08:58.250 --> 06:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
money is spent that probably could be
 
06:09:01.490 --> 06:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
part of legislation but also if we are
 
06:09:03.948 --> 06:09:03.958 align:start position:0%
setting this up as a revolving fund our
 
06:09:06.650 --> 06:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
priorities as legislators can be much
 
06:09:09.288 --> 06:09:09.298 align:start position:0%
more General they they don't have to be
 
06:09:11.330 --> 06:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
super specific if we choose not to do
 
06:09:14.208 --> 06:09:14.218 align:start position:0%
that so when I speak in Broad terms what
 
06:09:16.548 --> 06:09:16.558 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is we can give a high level
 
06:09:18.350 --> 06:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
Direction and then allow the
 
06:09:21.590 --> 06:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
implementing agency or authority to
 
06:09:24.350 --> 06:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
decide exactly how that plays out over
 
06:09:26.270 --> 06:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
the years with the fund because there
 
06:09:27.948 --> 06:09:27.958 align:start position:0%
will be changes obviously we've seen
 
06:09:30.770 --> 06:09:30.780 align:start position:0%
technology is changing every year
 
06:09:34.250 --> 06:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
so really the goal here is to create a
 
06:09:36.650 --> 06:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
bucket to receive funds that meet the
 
06:09:38.868 --> 06:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
check boxes of the FED while still
 
06:09:40.610 --> 06:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
allowing New Hampshire to make up our
 
06:09:42.048 --> 06:09:42.058 align:start position:0%
mind about what our priorities are
 
06:09:45.548 --> 06:09:45.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:48.708 --> 06:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
thank you if you had led with that that
 
06:09:50.030 --> 06:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
would much work
 
06:09:52.010 --> 06:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
much more easier to know thank you
 
06:09:53.090 --> 06:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
06:09:56.230 --> 06:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
06:09:59.448 --> 06:09:59.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so
 
06:10:02.150 --> 06:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams can you
 
06:10:05.390 --> 06:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
explain why we have to set up a separate
 
06:10:08.810 --> 06:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
new entity of whatever flavor wherever
 
06:10:11.650 --> 06:10:11.660 align:start position:0%
it's going to go why can't any
 
06:10:15.470 --> 06:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
monies for discrete defined purposes be
 
06:10:18.048 --> 06:10:18.058 align:start position:0%
deposited in an established financial
 
06:10:20.930 --> 06:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
institution that has all the appropriate
 
06:10:23.810 --> 06:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
controls and structure already why can't
 
06:10:26.990 --> 06:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
we use a regular Bank a regular savings
 
06:10:28.730 --> 06:10:28.740 align:start position:0%
loan or whatever
 
06:10:31.010 --> 06:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
so to be clear the term Green
 
06:10:34.430 --> 06:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote Bank is not really a bank
 
06:10:37.670 --> 06:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's an administered Loan Fund so
 
06:10:39.708 --> 06:10:39.718 align:start position:0%
there's there's a slight difference in
 
06:10:43.090 --> 06:10:43.100 align:start position:0%
how it actually comes to play in action
 
06:10:47.628 --> 06:10:47.638 align:start position:0%
we do have some non-profits capable of
 
06:10:49.850 --> 06:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
administering funds for loans here in
 
06:10:52.368 --> 06:10:52.378 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who could potentially be
 
06:10:56.270 --> 06:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
the host for a program like this so I'm
 
06:10:57.830 --> 06:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
kind of trying to come across as
 
06:11:01.128 --> 06:11:01.138 align:start position:0%
agnostic as to who administers but it
 
06:11:02.570 --> 06:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
still needs to meet the check boxes
 
06:11:04.250 --> 06:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
required by the Fed
 
06:11:06.288 --> 06:11:06.298 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not the kind of bank that
 
06:11:07.730 --> 06:11:07.740 align:start position:0%
you and I can put our money in and
 
06:11:10.070 --> 06:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
expect a return on investment it's the
 
06:11:11.810 --> 06:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
kind of bank that receives money from
 
06:11:14.628 --> 06:11:14.638 align:start position:0%
the fed and administers loans across the
 
06:11:18.350 --> 06:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
entire state for specific projects
 
06:11:22.430 --> 06:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up follow-up so to be clear
 
06:11:25.910 --> 06:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
a regular Bank a regular savings and a
 
06:11:28.910 --> 06:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
loan a regular Credit Union does not
 
06:11:31.368 --> 06:11:31.378 align:start position:0%
have the capability of taking on this
 
06:11:31.378 --> 06:11:33.530 align:start position:0%
have the capability of taking on this
function

06:11:33.530 --> 06:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
function
 
06:11:35.690 --> 06:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
so I'm hesitant to say no to your
 
06:11:37.850 --> 06:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
question representative Bernardi because
 
06:11:39.948 --> 06:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
I think there may be a way to work that
 
06:11:42.830 --> 06:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
out but I'm not the person with that
 
06:11:44.510 --> 06:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
level of knowledge right now to be able
 
06:11:46.490 --> 06:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
to give you an exact answer I think you
 
06:11:47.810 --> 06:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
probably want to save that question for
 
06:11:49.128 --> 06:11:49.138 align:start position:0%
someone after me
 
06:11:51.410 --> 06:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
06:11:54.530 --> 06:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
06:11:56.930 --> 06:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:11:59.510 --> 06:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
thinking my question and actually come
 
06:12:01.310 --> 06:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
explain this pretty well I understand
 
06:12:03.770 --> 06:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
the uh from what I understand where it
 
06:12:05.330 --> 06:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
says the department shall administer I'm
 
06:12:07.368 --> 06:12:07.378 align:start position:0%
guessing I'm the way I take it you're
 
06:12:08.530 --> 06:12:08.540 align:start position:0%
talking about the department of energy
 
06:12:12.830 --> 06:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
is going to administrate it and um I
 
06:12:14.470 --> 06:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
guess the main question I have is the
 
06:12:17.448 --> 06:12:17.458 align:start position:0%
divvying up of funds you have a bunch of
 
06:12:20.030 --> 06:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
different projects listed here
 
06:12:23.330 --> 06:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
um is it spread out evenly equally among
 
06:12:25.010 --> 06:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
every each one of these how do you
 
06:12:28.128 --> 06:12:28.138 align:start position:0%
define who gets what and is it
 
06:12:29.448 --> 06:12:29.458 align:start position:0%
completely up to the department energy
 
06:12:32.150 --> 06:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
of somebody gets all of it or none of it
 
06:12:34.128 --> 06:12:34.138 align:start position:0%
or such
 
06:12:36.170 --> 06:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
um so there are strings attached from
 
06:12:38.570 --> 06:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
the FED in terms of who gets what money
 
06:12:41.570 --> 06:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
but I don't have the nuances to exactly
 
06:12:43.910 --> 06:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
how the split is split out I will tell
 
06:12:46.190 --> 06:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
you with full disclosure that this bill
 
06:12:48.590 --> 06:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
is borrowed from the state of Maine and
 
06:12:52.190 --> 06:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
so that was sort of a first blush first
 
06:12:54.650 --> 06:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
draft here's an idea for how it could be
 
06:12:57.288 --> 06:12:57.298 align:start position:0%
split out but New Hampshire doesn't have
 
06:13:01.368 --> 06:13:01.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:02.750 --> 06:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:13:06.288 --> 06:13:06.298 align:start position:0%
thank you and also if uh if a new
 
06:13:08.628 --> 06:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
project wants to be added or if one
 
06:13:11.150 --> 06:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
needs more money well there need to be a
 
06:13:13.910 --> 06:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
ask for an increase for more funding for
 
06:13:16.128 --> 06:13:16.138 align:start position:0%
one of these projects
 
06:13:17.628 --> 06:13:17.638 align:start position:0%
so once again that's sort of an
 
06:13:19.250 --> 06:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
administrative question and I'm so glad
 
06:13:20.330 --> 06:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
you're asking this representative
 
06:13:22.670 --> 06:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
Summers usually the way this happens is
 
06:13:25.368 --> 06:13:25.378 align:start position:0%
with a grant you are awarded a grant
 
06:13:26.990 --> 06:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
based on your competitive application
 
06:13:29.330 --> 06:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
and you just get those funds in that
 
06:13:32.448 --> 06:13:32.458 align:start position:0%
bucket so coming back and asking for a
 
06:13:35.170 --> 06:13:35.180 align:start position:0%
second wave generally doesn't happen
 
06:13:37.610 --> 06:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
obviously if it's a super huge project
 
06:13:39.530 --> 06:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
and you've got all kinds of media
 
06:13:41.090 --> 06:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
attention and it's the sort of project
 
06:13:43.430 --> 06:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
that most of us in this room might want
 
06:13:44.708 --> 06:13:44.718 align:start position:0%
to see happen
 
06:13:46.850 --> 06:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
sometimes you find a way to find some
 
06:13:48.948 --> 06:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
more funds but I would say generally for
 
06:13:50.628 --> 06:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
the projects that we're discussing that
 
06:13:52.610 --> 06:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
these funds could be used for it's a
 
06:13:54.470 --> 06:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
one-time application with grant funding
 
06:13:56.570 --> 06:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
for that project it's a loan and it is
 
06:13:59.208 --> 06:13:59.218 align:start position:0%
paid back so that future applicants can
 
06:14:01.430 --> 06:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
then get a loan the next year and the
 
06:14:04.150 --> 06:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:07.310 --> 06:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
okay I have a couple of questions before
 
06:14:10.850 --> 06:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
I go to representative Wendy Thomas
 
06:14:15.048 --> 06:14:15.058 align:start position:0%
on page three line ten
 
06:14:16.910 --> 06:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation talks about
 
06:14:20.690 --> 06:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
driving Capital into Market gaps
 
06:14:23.990 --> 06:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
for goods and services can you define
 
06:14:29.350 --> 06:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:32.868 --> 06:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
just one second let me catch up with you
 
06:14:35.628 --> 06:14:35.638 align:start position:0%
page 3 line 10.
 
06:14:37.128 --> 06:14:37.138 align:start position:0%
okay here we go
 
06:14:39.170 --> 06:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
clean energy accelerative fund is hereby
 
06:14:41.448 --> 06:14:41.458 align:start position:0%
established as a dedicated specialized
 
06:14:43.190 --> 06:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
Finance program designed to drive
 
06:14:45.650 --> 06:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
private Capital into Market gaps for
 
06:14:47.810 --> 06:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
goods and services producing lower zero
 
06:14:50.150 --> 06:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions and use Finance
 
06:14:51.830 --> 06:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
tools to mitigate climate change that is
 
06:14:53.448 --> 06:14:53.458 align:start position:0%
funded by government public private or
 
06:14:55.368 --> 06:14:55.378 align:start position:0%
charitable contributions invest in our
 
06:14:56.750 --> 06:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
finances projects alone or in
 
06:14:58.788 --> 06:14:58.798 align:start position:0%
conjunction with other investors so
 
06:15:00.708 --> 06:15:00.718 align:start position:0%
Market gaps right now I would say we've
 
06:15:02.390 --> 06:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
had quite a bit of discussion in this
 
06:15:05.330 --> 06:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
group about EV charging stations I would
 
06:15:06.650 --> 06:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
consider that right now to be something
 
06:15:08.270 --> 06:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is lagging in and
 
06:15:09.650 --> 06:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
could potentially be seen as a market
 
06:15:12.110 --> 06:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
Gap just right for some kind of outside
 
06:15:12.120 --> 06:15:14.090 align:start position:0%
Gap just right for some kind of outside
capital

06:15:14.090 --> 06:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
capital
 
06:15:16.788 --> 06:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
okay thank you as a follow-up I would
 
06:15:21.230 --> 06:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
ask on line 15 of the same page
 
06:15:24.708 --> 06:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
three line 15 it talks about the rapid
 
06:15:27.650 --> 06:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
deployment of mature Technologies
 
06:15:32.150 --> 06:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:34.788 --> 06:15:34.798 align:start position:0%
I don't see why it wouldn't but I'd have
 
06:15:37.250 --> 06:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
to look at the Ira's criteria I don't
 
06:15:40.070 --> 06:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
have a no off the top of my head but I
 
06:15:41.810 --> 06:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
would say nuclear is a mature technology
 
06:15:43.970 --> 06:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
and so potentially funds could be
 
06:15:45.890 --> 06:15:45.900 align:start position:0%
directed to that as long as the IRA
 
06:15:49.910 --> 06:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:51.890 --> 06:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and then if you flip over
 
06:15:55.430 --> 06:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
to page four line one
 
06:15:57.530 --> 06:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
talks about private private Capital
 
06:15:59.868 --> 06:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
markets with respect to investing in
 
06:16:03.350 --> 06:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas reduction projects
 
06:16:05.868 --> 06:16:05.878 align:start position:0%
are those the only kind of projects that
 
06:16:08.690 --> 06:16:08.700 align:start position:0%
these funds could uh be used for its
 
06:16:14.810 --> 06:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:17.448 --> 06:16:17.458 align:start position:0%
so once again we're talking about
 
06:16:19.490 --> 06:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
receiving federal funds with strings
 
06:16:21.708 --> 06:16:21.718 align:start position:0%
attached so there is quite a bit of
 
06:16:24.610 --> 06:16:24.620 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas reduction language in the
 
06:16:28.310 --> 06:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
ghgrf from the IRA
 
06:16:30.590 --> 06:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would have to hear exactly
 
06:16:32.868 --> 06:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
what you're considering that might be a
 
06:16:35.330 --> 06:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
project worthy of funding through this
 
06:16:39.110 --> 06:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
renewable fund that doesn't include some
 
06:16:46.310 --> 06:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:49.010 --> 06:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
okay so basically your answer is federal
 
06:16:52.010 --> 06:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
fund strings attached okay I think so
 
06:16:54.948 --> 06:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
from their ghgrf all right thank you
 
06:16:56.930 --> 06:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
that's good representative Wendy Thomas
 
06:17:00.230 --> 06:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you um just a point
 
06:17:01.548 --> 06:17:01.558 align:start position:0%
of clarification you mentioned
 
06:17:03.770 --> 06:17:03.780 align:start position:0%
commercial and municipalities having
 
06:17:05.570 --> 06:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
access to these funds anything for
 
06:17:05.580 --> 06:17:11.690 align:start position:0%
access to these funds anything for
residential

06:17:11.690 --> 06:17:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:14.030 --> 06:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
so representative Wendy Thomas can you
 
06:17:15.650 --> 06:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
just clarify I'm sorry when you say
 
06:17:17.270 --> 06:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
anything for residential do you mean
 
06:17:20.030 --> 06:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
someone who manages many units or do you
 
06:17:22.610 --> 06:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
mean an individual homeowner
 
06:17:25.628 --> 06:17:25.638 align:start position:0%
I would think more of a multi-family
 
06:17:28.190 --> 06:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
multiple units
 
06:17:29.990 --> 06:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
so but that would be considered
 
06:17:33.890 --> 06:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
commercial right yes but so this isn't
 
06:17:36.288 --> 06:17:36.298 align:start position:0%
down to the nuclear level of residential
 
06:17:38.750 --> 06:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
this is not this is a much higher level
 
06:17:41.270 --> 06:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
so if the municipality were to take on
 
06:17:43.310 --> 06:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
some kind of a um
 
06:17:46.190 --> 06:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
large project that's Energy Efficiency
 
06:17:49.190 --> 06:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
or solar for rooftops or whatever that
 
06:17:51.350 --> 06:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
municipality designs decides to sign up
 
06:17:53.330 --> 06:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
for to use the funds it could be
 
06:17:55.430 --> 06:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
funneled towards single-family or
 
06:17:58.910 --> 06:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
multi-unit residential from my reading
 
06:18:00.770 --> 06:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
but I also don't think it's really
 
06:18:03.230 --> 06:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
intended to just benefit individual
 
06:18:05.750 --> 06:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
homeowners okay and I have a follow-up
 
06:18:05.760 --> 06:18:07.610 align:start position:0%
homeowners okay and I have a follow-up
follow-up

06:18:07.610 --> 06:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:18:10.250 --> 06:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
um so if this vehicle is not set up to
 
06:18:19.970 --> 06:18:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:21.708 --> 06:18:21.718 align:start position:0%
that's a great question
 
06:18:25.910 --> 06:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
it will be very difficult for
 
06:18:25.920 --> 06:18:27.470 align:start position:0%
it will be very difficult for
um

06:18:27.470 --> 06:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:30.170 --> 06:18:30.180 align:start position:0%
a different entity to step up without
 
06:18:33.048 --> 06:18:33.058 align:start position:0%
the state's backing
 
06:18:33.058 --> 06:18:34.010 align:start position:0%
the state's backing
um

06:18:34.010 --> 06:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:36.830 --> 06:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that states that
 
06:18:39.230 --> 06:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
have green Banks can influence the
 
06:18:40.910 --> 06:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
decisions as to how the money is made
 
06:18:43.690 --> 06:18:43.700 align:start position:0%
because the state is part of that
 
06:18:46.430 --> 06:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
states without Green Banks defer
 
06:18:48.170 --> 06:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
responsibility for administering the
 
06:18:50.930 --> 06:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
funds to non-profit and not-for-profit
 
06:18:53.208 --> 06:18:53.218 align:start position:0%
financing institutions so it is still
 
06:18:53.218 --> 06:18:54.708 align:start position:0%
financing institutions so it is still
possible

06:18:54.708 --> 06:18:54.718 align:start position:0%
possible
 
06:18:57.890 --> 06:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
but in terms of actually having someone
 
06:19:01.548 --> 06:19:01.558 align:start position:0%
in the room where it happens I think we
 
06:19:03.650 --> 06:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
want New Hampshire to be involved thank
 
06:19:03.660 --> 06:19:07.310 align:start position:0%
want New Hampshire to be involved thank
you

06:19:07.310 --> 06:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:09.890 --> 06:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
06:19:11.208 --> 06:19:11.218 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
06:19:12.530 --> 06:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh we're getting back
 
06:19:14.810 --> 06:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
to nuclear we do terms there it was
 
06:19:17.090 --> 06:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
mature technology now obviously we have
 
06:19:19.430 --> 06:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
mature Technologies in nucleus such as
 
06:19:20.930 --> 06:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
you know sea workstation which has been
 
06:19:23.150 --> 06:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
operating for a long time but I don't
 
06:19:24.830 --> 06:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
know of anybody who's planning on even
 
06:19:26.750 --> 06:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
remotely looking into building something
 
06:19:29.570 --> 06:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
like that again so would this cover the
 
06:19:31.850 --> 06:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
new maybe not so Monsieur nuclear
 
06:19:33.948 --> 06:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
technology such as smrs with small
 
06:19:35.930 --> 06:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
modular reactors which are more than
 
06:19:37.430 --> 06:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
likely going to be what the first the
 
06:19:39.048 --> 06:19:39.058 align:start position:0%
next generation of nuclear reactors
 
06:19:40.850 --> 06:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
would be they're going to be different
 
06:19:43.010 --> 06:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
than the standard light water reactors
 
06:19:45.650 --> 06:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
so would they be covered because they're
 
06:19:47.470 --> 06:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
not so mature
 
06:19:49.250 --> 06:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I think that's
 
06:19:51.350 --> 06:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
an excellent question I would probably
 
06:19:53.750 --> 06:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
defer to federal guidelines to answer it
 
06:19:56.150 --> 06:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
but I'm hopeful because I do think that
 
06:19:58.128 --> 06:19:58.138 align:start position:0%
that is the wave of nuclear future and
 
06:19:59.810 --> 06:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
we have some potential in Seabrook for
 
06:19:59.820 --> 06:20:04.628 align:start position:0%
we have some potential in Seabrook for
that

06:20:04.628 --> 06:20:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:07.070 --> 06:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative Jack has a question uh
 
06:20:08.990 --> 06:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you uh
 
06:20:10.970 --> 06:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any other situation
 
06:20:14.110 --> 06:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
where the federal government grants
 
06:20:16.610 --> 06:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
monies in this quantity to a Commercial
 
06:20:21.890 --> 06:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:24.230 --> 06:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative Jack I'm not aware of
 
06:20:25.548 --> 06:20:25.558 align:start position:0%
it that doesn't mean it doesn't exist
 
06:20:30.890 --> 06:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:33.288 --> 06:20:33.298 align:start position:0%
okay so you know further questions from
 
06:20:35.628 --> 06:20:35.638 align:start position:0%
the committee I think representative
 
06:20:35.638 --> 06:20:37.010 align:start position:0%
the committee I think representative
McWilliams

06:20:37.010 --> 06:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
McWilliams
 
06:20:39.288 --> 06:20:39.298 align:start position:0%
whoops I guess there was one more well
 
06:20:40.610 --> 06:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
laid hand
 
06:20:42.890 --> 06:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
delay a delayed request that's a pretty
 
06:20:44.868 --> 06:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
big question sure representative partial
 
06:20:47.930 --> 06:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
has a question yes um I keep on hearing
 
06:20:49.128 --> 06:20:49.138 align:start position:0%
this referred to as a green Bank
 
06:20:51.048 --> 06:20:51.058 align:start position:0%
understanding of the doe refers to was
 
06:20:53.690 --> 06:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
much but in fact it's more of a
 
06:20:53.700 --> 06:20:55.250 align:start position:0%
much but in fact it's more of a
dedicated

06:20:55.250 --> 06:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
dedicated
 
06:20:58.788 --> 06:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
excitator fund that would sit inside of
 
06:21:00.410 --> 06:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy for them to
 
06:21:00.420 --> 06:21:01.368 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy for them to
administer

06:21:01.368 --> 06:21:01.378 align:start position:0%
administer
 
06:21:03.890 --> 06:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
is that about is that
 
06:21:05.570 --> 06:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification
 
06:21:08.448 --> 06:21:08.458 align:start position:0%
questions that's what I could clarify
 
06:21:10.490 --> 06:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
um so I started out this presentation by
 
06:21:13.190 --> 06:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
saying I'm open to it being hosted in a
 
06:21:14.930 --> 06:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
different department if Department of
 
06:21:17.390 --> 06:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
energy doesn't feel that numbers and
 
06:21:20.270 --> 06:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
math and specifically money is their
 
06:21:22.670 --> 06:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
thing that's okay we have other state
 
06:21:25.270 --> 06:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
authorities who may be a better match
 
06:21:27.708 --> 06:21:27.718 align:start position:0%
but certainly that's the intention as it
 
06:21:31.070 --> 06:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
was drafted based on the main model
 
06:21:33.530 --> 06:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you that's
 
06:21:33.540 --> 06:21:36.470 align:start position:0%
thank you that's
okay

06:21:36.470 --> 06:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:21:40.250 --> 06:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
so would you be open to a potential
 
06:21:42.530 --> 06:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the bill that
 
06:21:48.650 --> 06:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:52.250 --> 06:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:54.310 --> 06:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
there isn't there is another revolving
 
06:21:57.350 --> 06:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund administrator within New
 
06:21:58.548 --> 06:21:58.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire government I've forgotten the
 
06:22:00.288 --> 06:22:00.298 align:start position:0%
name of the department that administers
 
06:22:03.048 --> 06:22:03.058 align:start position:0%
it right now yes okay all right thank
 
06:22:04.850 --> 06:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
you thank you all right so you know
 
06:22:06.470 --> 06:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee we'll
 
06:22:08.628 --> 06:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank representative McMillan McWilliams
 
06:22:11.090 --> 06:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
for introducing this bill and next I
 
06:22:13.190 --> 06:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
will call to the
 
06:22:14.930 --> 06:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
testimony table
 
06:22:17.690 --> 06:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
Mr Josh Elliott from the Department of
 
06:22:17.700 --> 06:22:48.830 align:start position:0%
Mr Josh Elliott from the Department of
energy

06:22:48.830 --> 06:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:50.868 --> 06:22:50.878 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
06:22:52.010 --> 06:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record Josh
 
06:22:53.448 --> 06:22:53.458 align:start position:0%
Elliott director of the division of
 
06:22:54.830 --> 06:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
policy and programs the New Hampshire
 
06:22:56.810 --> 06:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
Department of energy uh the department
 
06:22:58.850 --> 06:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
is neutral on this bill um I think
 
06:23:00.410 --> 06:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams laid out a
 
06:23:02.448 --> 06:23:02.458 align:start position:0%
good presentation in terms of the source
 
06:23:06.110 --> 06:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
of funds the IRA administered by the EPA
 
06:23:08.208 --> 06:23:08.218 align:start position:0%
um that make these funds available on a
 
06:23:10.970 --> 06:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
competitive basis so New Hampshire or
 
06:23:12.948 --> 06:23:12.958 align:start position:0%
whatever entity the community decides
 
06:23:14.510 --> 06:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
should be the best entity to receive
 
06:23:16.430 --> 06:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
these funds would have to file an
 
06:23:17.868 --> 06:23:17.878 align:start position:0%
application there's no guarantee that
 
06:23:20.470 --> 06:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
funds are would be
 
06:23:22.730 --> 06:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
awarded to the state obviously depends
 
06:23:24.890 --> 06:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
on the the value of the application that
 
06:23:26.090 --> 06:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
is submitted so just want to make sure
 
06:23:28.010 --> 06:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
that clear remembering back to my
 
06:23:29.270 --> 06:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
presentation talking about formula
 
06:23:30.770 --> 06:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
grants versus competitive this would
 
06:23:33.410 --> 06:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
fall into the competitive category
 
06:23:35.270 --> 06:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
um the department just uh again we're
 
06:23:37.010 --> 06:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
neutral if the committee decides we're
 
06:23:39.470 --> 06:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
the best agency to run these funds you
 
06:23:41.570 --> 06:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
know you know you tell us to jump we ask
 
06:23:43.128 --> 06:23:43.138 align:start position:0%
how high
 
06:23:45.170 --> 06:23:45.180 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of things for
 
06:23:48.230 --> 06:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
consideration as as uh if you decide to
 
06:23:49.430 --> 06:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
move forward this bill in its current
 
06:23:49.440 --> 06:23:50.690 align:start position:0%
move forward this bill in its current
form

06:23:50.690 --> 06:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
form
 
06:23:52.190 --> 06:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
um I will note
 
06:23:52.200 --> 06:23:53.208 align:start position:0%
um I will note
um

06:23:53.208 --> 06:23:53.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:58.070 --> 06:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
on page four lines 25 to 26 where it
 
06:23:59.930 --> 06:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
goes through uh talks about any
 
06:24:02.208 --> 06:24:02.218 align:start position:0%
sustaining operations shall manage the
 
06:24:03.770 --> 06:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
department shall manage revenue from
 
06:24:05.868 --> 06:24:05.878 align:start position:0%
financing fees interest repaid loans and
 
06:24:07.730 --> 06:24:07.740 align:start position:0%
other types of funding
 
06:24:07.740 --> 06:24:08.390 align:start position:0%
other types of funding
um

06:24:08.390 --> 06:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:10.190 --> 06:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
just would want to make it clear that
 
06:24:12.410 --> 06:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
the if awarded These funds that the
 
06:24:14.868 --> 06:24:14.878 align:start position:0%
department could pay for staff up front
 
06:24:16.190 --> 06:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
before the loans were actually
 
06:24:18.470 --> 06:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
administered it's probably enough of a
 
06:24:20.330 --> 06:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
stretch from a legal standpoint to say
 
06:24:22.788 --> 06:24:22.798 align:start position:0%
that other funds would count but just to
 
06:24:24.650 --> 06:24:24.660 align:start position:0%
make it clear that the department could
 
06:24:24.660 --> 06:24:25.788 align:start position:0%
make it clear that the department could
actually

06:24:25.788 --> 06:24:25.798 align:start position:0%
actually
 
06:24:25.798 --> 06:24:26.390 align:start position:0%
actually
um

06:24:26.390 --> 06:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:28.670 --> 06:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
pay for folks before loan repayments
 
06:24:31.610 --> 06:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
start coming back in into the fund
 
06:24:31.620 --> 06:24:32.930 align:start position:0%
start coming back in into the fund
um

06:24:32.930 --> 06:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:34.788 --> 06:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
there is a question and I don't know and
 
06:24:36.650 --> 06:24:36.660 align:start position:0%
again the the bill is written broadly
 
06:24:38.090 --> 06:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
enough that I don't know if this would
 
06:24:40.850 --> 06:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
come up but on the off chance EPA is
 
06:24:43.788 --> 06:24:43.798 align:start position:0%
currently going through their uh process
 
06:24:45.590 --> 06:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
to come up with the guidelines for how
 
06:24:47.270 --> 06:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
these funds will be administered I
 
06:24:48.470 --> 06:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
believe they're still in the What's
 
06:24:50.330 --> 06:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
called the RFI phase or request for
 
06:24:52.070 --> 06:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
information essentially they're seeking
 
06:24:54.730 --> 06:24:54.740 align:start position:0%
input from other entities whether it's
 
06:24:57.830 --> 06:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
other states whether it's other
 
06:24:59.090 --> 06:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
stakeholders sort of in the process
 
06:25:01.850 --> 06:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
existing Green Banks about what these
 
06:25:03.170 --> 06:25:03.180 align:start position:0%
funds should look like what the process
 
06:25:04.548 --> 06:25:04.558 align:start position:0%
should look like what the applications
 
06:25:06.288 --> 06:25:06.298 align:start position:0%
should look like what they should be
 
06:25:07.368 --> 06:25:07.378 align:start position:0%
considered when they're looking at
 
06:25:09.048 --> 06:25:09.058 align:start position:0%
awarding funds
 
06:25:09.058 --> 06:25:09.708 align:start position:0%
awarding funds
um

06:25:09.708 --> 06:25:09.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:12.530 --> 06:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
so if the state is more strict than
 
06:25:14.150 --> 06:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
whatever those guidelines come from the
 
06:25:15.230 --> 06:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
federal government then there's really
 
06:25:17.930 --> 06:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
no issue on implementation but if for
 
06:25:22.250 --> 06:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
some reason the EPA says uh we must do X
 
06:25:24.530 --> 06:25:24.540 align:start position:0%
or we must allow this sort of you know
 
06:25:27.530 --> 06:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh uh projects are eligible and the
 
06:25:29.090 --> 06:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
state law is structured in such a way
 
06:25:30.170 --> 06:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't allow us to do that
 
06:25:32.570 --> 06:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
there's a question about okay if we the
 
06:25:34.610 --> 06:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
the federal government who is mandate
 
06:25:36.830 --> 06:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
you know who basically tells us what we
 
06:25:38.030 --> 06:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
can and can't do with these funds is
 
06:25:39.708 --> 06:25:39.718 align:start position:0%
saying You must do this and state law is
 
06:25:41.690 --> 06:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
saying well you can't do that just if
 
06:25:43.548 --> 06:25:43.558 align:start position:0%
there's some mechanism there and again I
 
06:25:45.350 --> 06:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
don't know there's nothing obvious in
 
06:25:46.670 --> 06:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
the Bill of where I could say oh that's
 
06:25:47.930 --> 06:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
probably going to be an issue with this
 
06:25:49.970 --> 06:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
particular provision but
 
06:25:51.770 --> 06:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
just in general something to think about
 
06:25:53.750 --> 06:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
of to make sure if there's some sort of
 
06:25:55.670 --> 06:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
conflict though that is dealt with um
 
06:25:56.930 --> 06:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
just to make sure the department isn't
 
06:25:58.670 --> 06:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
hamstrung of trying to figure out do we
 
06:26:01.730 --> 06:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
violate federal law or state law
 
06:26:01.740 --> 06:26:02.868 align:start position:0%
violate federal law or state law
um

06:26:02.868 --> 06:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:04.970 --> 06:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
uh back on
 
06:26:08.628 --> 06:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
um page four uh Roman eight
 
06:26:11.810 --> 06:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
um so it's lines uh 22
 
06:26:11.820 --> 06:26:12.708 align:start position:0%
um so it's lines uh 22
um

06:26:12.708 --> 06:26:12.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:14.810 --> 06:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me I'm sorry uh Romans 7
 
06:26:18.170 --> 06:26:18.180 align:start position:0%
excuse me line 16 through 21 where it
 
06:26:19.548 --> 06:26:19.558 align:start position:0%
has the following provision shall govern
 
06:26:21.410 --> 06:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
the funds project prioritization
 
06:26:23.510 --> 06:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
requirements and let's talk about a
 
06:26:25.368 --> 06:26:25.378 align:start position:0%
which has the mitigation the reduction
 
06:26:27.470 --> 06:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
of greenhouse gas emissions and then B
 
06:26:29.030 --> 06:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
which is the
 
06:26:29.040 --> 06:26:29.628 align:start position:0%
which is the
um

06:26:29.628 --> 06:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:31.670 --> 06:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
requirement that 40 of the investment
 
06:26:33.948 --> 06:26:33.958 align:start position:0%
activity directed to serve vulnerable
 
06:26:35.690 --> 06:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
communities which is defined elsewhere
 
06:26:36.910 --> 06:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
06:26:39.770 --> 06:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
additional direction would be helpful
 
06:26:41.208 --> 06:26:41.218 align:start position:0%
um just in terms of what happens if
 
06:26:42.948 --> 06:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
we're in a situation of where the
 
06:26:44.510 --> 06:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
apartment is seeing sort of a batch of
 
06:26:46.548 --> 06:26:46.558 align:start position:0%
loans come in for projects one that
 
06:26:48.230 --> 06:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
would dramatically reduce greenhouse gas
 
06:26:50.868 --> 06:26:50.878 align:start position:0%
emissions however
 
06:26:52.070 --> 06:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
um you know you could make an argument
 
06:26:54.890 --> 06:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
that the benefits largely accrue to
 
06:26:56.930 --> 06:26:56.940 align:start position:0%
communities that don't fit the profile
 
06:26:59.090 --> 06:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
of the 40 percent or if we're looking at
 
06:27:01.970 --> 06:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
a bunch of uh of projects asking for
 
06:27:04.190 --> 06:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
financing that meet all the the 40
 
06:27:04.200 --> 06:27:05.270 align:start position:0%
financing that meet all the the 40
percent

06:27:05.270 --> 06:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:27:07.190 --> 06:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry they're all targeted
 
06:27:09.830 --> 06:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
towards uh vulnerable communities but
 
06:27:12.650 --> 06:27:12.660 align:start position:0%
the greenhouse gas emissions that would
 
06:27:14.930 --> 06:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
be realized from such a project are less
 
06:27:17.270 --> 06:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
than those that would be in a
 
06:27:19.128 --> 06:27:19.138 align:start position:0%
non-vulnerable community
 
06:27:21.170 --> 06:27:21.180 align:start position:0%
um so just a sense of balance of how you
 
06:27:22.548 --> 06:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
look wanted a department to take a look
 
06:27:24.288 --> 06:27:24.298 align:start position:0%
at those balancing those two priorities
 
06:27:26.868 --> 06:27:26.878 align:start position:0%
if for some reason there's a conflict
 
06:27:26.878 --> 06:27:27.530 align:start position:0%
if for some reason there's a conflict
um

06:27:27.530 --> 06:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:30.830 --> 06:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
I read that section is to mean rather
 
06:27:33.170 --> 06:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
than sort of a year by year basis it is
 
06:27:35.270 --> 06:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
a sort of over the
 
06:27:36.948 --> 06:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
um you know the administration of a fund
 
06:27:38.690 --> 06:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
for sort of the duration that you try to
 
06:27:40.910 --> 06:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
match to make sure that there's
 
06:27:43.490 --> 06:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
um that you hit that 40 percent but it
 
06:27:44.930 --> 06:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
would be not in any particular given
 
06:27:47.448 --> 06:27:47.458 align:start position:0%
year it must be 40 percent
 
06:27:49.010 --> 06:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
um so again just for consideration for
 
06:27:50.868 --> 06:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
additional legislative Direction on that
 
06:27:52.190 --> 06:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
would be
 
06:27:54.650 --> 06:27:54.660 align:start position:0%
um helpful the last piece
 
06:27:54.660 --> 06:27:55.310 align:start position:0%
um helpful the last piece
um

06:27:55.310 --> 06:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:56.570 --> 06:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
what did I know there was some
 
06:27:58.250 --> 06:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
discussion about this earlier
 
06:28:00.170 --> 06:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
um I don't see any provision in here for
 
06:28:01.548 --> 06:28:01.558 align:start position:0%
whatever reason
 
06:28:03.948 --> 06:28:03.958 align:start position:0%
um that if the state were to apply for
 
06:28:06.110 --> 06:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
these funds and say rather than you know
 
06:28:07.788 --> 06:28:07.798 align:start position:0%
out of the 27 billion for example they
 
06:28:09.230 --> 06:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
decide okay New Hampshire you're going
 
06:28:10.850 --> 06:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
to get a million dollars
 
06:28:13.490 --> 06:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
to you know to have to hire staff to
 
06:28:15.708 --> 06:28:15.718 align:start position:0%
administer a revolving Loan Fund of just
 
06:28:16.850 --> 06:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
a million dollars I know it's a big
 
06:28:18.288 --> 06:28:18.298 align:start position:0%
number but in terms of state agencies
 
06:28:19.970 --> 06:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of money to be
 
06:28:21.708 --> 06:28:21.718 align:start position:0%
managing it would make more sense on
 
06:28:24.048 --> 06:28:24.058 align:start position:0%
that basis to contract that out with a
 
06:28:25.490 --> 06:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
third party
 
06:28:27.948 --> 06:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
um whether it's for example we have a
 
06:28:31.850 --> 06:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
couple of of small funds that we have uh
 
06:28:33.170 --> 06:28:33.180 align:start position:0%
contracts with the Community Development
 
06:28:35.390 --> 06:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority or the cdfa who
 
06:28:38.090 --> 06:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
manages those on a revolving loan basis
 
06:28:40.190 --> 06:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
that would be um similar to these
 
06:28:41.868 --> 06:28:41.878 align:start position:0%
projects here but at a million dollars
 
06:28:43.190 --> 06:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
for example
 
06:28:44.390 --> 06:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
um you know it would make more sense for
 
06:28:45.948 --> 06:28:45.958 align:start position:0%
the Department to go out and contract
 
06:28:48.590 --> 06:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
with some other entity such as again
 
06:28:50.270 --> 06:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
Community Development Finance Authority
 
06:28:51.890 --> 06:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
or the perhaps the business Finance
 
06:28:51.900 --> 06:28:53.030 align:start position:0%
or the perhaps the business Finance
Authority

06:28:53.030 --> 06:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
06:28:55.850 --> 06:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
um depending on um which entity was
 
06:28:57.890 --> 06:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
probably better suited and again with
 
06:28:59.150 --> 06:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
the Department would go through the
 
06:29:02.150 --> 06:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
regular RFP process to determine what
 
06:29:03.948 --> 06:29:03.958 align:start position:0%
kind of entity would be the the best one
 
06:29:07.430 --> 06:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
to receive a um those State funds
 
06:29:09.170 --> 06:29:09.180 align:start position:0%
um so those were really the the only
 
06:29:11.448 --> 06:29:11.458 align:start position:0%
things just in terms of purely the
 
06:29:13.490 --> 06:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
administration uh administrative portion
 
06:29:14.930 --> 06:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
of okay how does the department actually
 
06:29:17.390 --> 06:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
act on these if if we get the funds just
 
06:29:19.310 --> 06:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure you know there are plenty
 
06:29:21.110 --> 06:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
of times just in on the programmatic
 
06:29:23.930 --> 06:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
side of uh where clear legislative
 
06:29:25.430 --> 06:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
Direction rather than letting the
 
06:29:26.750 --> 06:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
department try to figure out okay well
 
06:29:28.070 --> 06:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
what did the legislature mean by this
 
06:29:29.390 --> 06:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
and do they really mean that or should
 
06:29:31.850 --> 06:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
we do this so I always appreciate clear
 
06:29:34.368 --> 06:29:34.378 align:start position:0%
legislative Direction when it comes up
 
06:29:36.288 --> 06:29:36.298 align:start position:0%
to these issues so with that I will stop
 
06:29:37.730 --> 06:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
talking and Mr chairman I'm happy to
 
06:29:39.170 --> 06:29:39.180 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
06:29:41.690 --> 06:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much some very good
 
06:29:44.390 --> 06:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
suggestions uh and reactions to this
 
06:29:46.610 --> 06:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
bill we appreciate that representative
 
06:29:49.070 --> 06:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
Corman has a question for you thank you
 
06:29:52.310 --> 06:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr Elliott uh
 
06:29:54.530 --> 06:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
when you talked about page four lines 25
 
06:29:56.930 --> 06:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
and 26 I'm afraid I just didn't really
 
06:29:59.208 --> 06:29:59.218 align:start position:0%
understand what you were telling us can
 
06:30:01.788 --> 06:30:01.798 align:start position:0%
you clarify that please oh sure
 
06:30:04.730 --> 06:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
um so on lines 25 and 26 um so it's
 
06:30:07.430 --> 06:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
under Roman 8 which starts on page I'm
 
06:30:10.010 --> 06:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
sorry line 22 which is the provisions
 
06:30:11.868 --> 06:30:11.878 align:start position:0%
that govern the administration of the
 
06:30:14.448 --> 06:30:14.458 align:start position:0%
fund um so really that uh section
 
06:30:17.868 --> 06:30:17.878 align:start position:0%
subsection B there lines 25 and 26 to
 
06:30:19.730 --> 06:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
sustain operations the gov the
 
06:30:21.890 --> 06:30:21.900 align:start position:0%
department shall manage Revenue oh I
 
06:30:23.448 --> 06:30:23.458 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm sorry
 
06:30:23.458 --> 06:30:29.030 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm sorry
um

06:30:29.030 --> 06:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:31.010 --> 06:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
where am I looking here
 
06:30:31.020 --> 06:30:33.048 align:start position:0%
where am I looking here
um

06:30:33.048 --> 06:30:33.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:35.270 --> 06:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry yes to sustain operations
 
06:30:37.310 --> 06:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
the department shall manage revenue from
 
06:30:39.890 --> 06:30:39.900 align:start position:0%
financing fees interest repaid loans and
 
06:30:41.330 --> 06:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
other types of funding
 
06:30:42.708 --> 06:30:42.718 align:start position:0%
um so essentially
 
06:30:44.810 --> 06:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
um I would just uh I should say not I
 
06:30:46.368 --> 06:30:46.378 align:start position:0%
personally but other department would
 
06:30:48.590 --> 06:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
wish to see clear language that would
 
06:30:50.930 --> 06:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
allow the funding of staff from the
 
06:30:53.570 --> 06:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
original capitalization from the fund um
 
06:30:55.430 --> 06:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
because that would give us the staff in
 
06:30:57.890 --> 06:30:57.900 align:start position:0%
order to actually do the initial round
 
06:31:01.310 --> 06:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
of of of loan Awards and and especially
 
06:31:03.110 --> 06:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
depending on the terms of the loans
 
06:31:04.788 --> 06:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
um those repayments may not be coming in
 
06:31:06.288 --> 06:31:06.298 align:start position:0%
immediately so there would be some lag
 
06:31:08.030 --> 06:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
time before Revenue was received back
 
06:31:10.128 --> 06:31:10.138 align:start position:0%
into the fund so just want to make it
 
06:31:11.510 --> 06:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
clear that the
 
06:31:11.520 --> 06:31:12.110 align:start position:0%
clear that the
um

06:31:12.110 --> 06:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:31:14.270 --> 06:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
Department could could use some of those
 
06:31:15.890 --> 06:31:15.900 align:start position:0%
funds up front to pay for staff to set
 
06:31:16.970 --> 06:31:16.980 align:start position:0%
up the program
 
06:31:19.970 --> 06:31:19.980 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative munz
 
06:31:22.070 --> 06:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chair and
 
06:31:24.110 --> 06:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
thank you again for being here
 
06:31:26.030 --> 06:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
um I want to follow up on a question
 
06:31:28.548 --> 06:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
that representative Bernardi asked the
 
06:31:30.410 --> 06:31:30.420 align:start position:0%
previous uh asked representative
 
06:31:33.230 --> 06:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
McWilliams when she introduced the bill
 
06:31:34.910 --> 06:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
um concerning whether or not this money
 
06:31:37.368 --> 06:31:37.378 align:start position:0%
could be given to a private financial
 
06:31:37.378 --> 06:31:39.410 align:start position:0%
could be given to a private financial
institution

06:31:39.410 --> 06:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
institution
 
06:31:41.090 --> 06:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming and I don't know if you
 
06:31:42.770 --> 06:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
can comment on this but I'm assuming
 
06:31:44.690 --> 06:31:44.700 align:start position:0%
that that would not be possible because
 
06:31:46.548 --> 06:31:46.558 align:start position:0%
the federal government would not would
 
06:31:48.110 --> 06:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
not allow that that one of the
 
06:31:50.390 --> 06:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
provisions of the program is that it has
 
06:31:52.190 --> 06:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
to go to a state agency
 
06:31:54.530 --> 06:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't necessarily so usually how
 
06:31:55.910 --> 06:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you for the question
 
06:31:58.190 --> 06:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
generally speaking
 
06:31:59.990 --> 06:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
um a lot of these programs whether it's
 
06:32:02.090 --> 06:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
this one or other ones there are
 
06:32:04.190 --> 06:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
um uh what they called eligible entities
 
06:32:05.930 --> 06:32:05.940 align:start position:0%
who are allowed to apply
 
06:32:07.610 --> 06:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
um for these funds
 
06:32:09.470 --> 06:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to recall off the top of
 
06:32:12.770 --> 06:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
my head I don't believe private Banks or
 
06:32:14.390 --> 06:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
other sort of Institutions are listed as
 
06:32:15.890 --> 06:32:15.900 align:start position:0%
eligible entities it's usually state
 
06:32:18.770 --> 06:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
agencies existing Green Banks
 
06:32:20.448 --> 06:32:20.458 align:start position:0%
um I believe there's a provision for
 
06:32:22.430 --> 06:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
certain non-profits so in this case it
 
06:32:24.110 --> 06:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
would be organizations like Community
 
06:32:26.270 --> 06:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me Community Development Finance
 
06:32:27.650 --> 06:32:27.660 align:start position:0%
Authority or the business Finance
 
06:32:27.660 --> 06:32:29.090 align:start position:0%
Authority or the business Finance
Authority

06:32:29.090 --> 06:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
06:32:31.490 --> 06:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
um or set of other entities that like
 
06:32:31.500 --> 06:32:32.390 align:start position:0%
um or set of other entities that like
that

06:32:32.390 --> 06:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:32:33.770 --> 06:32:33.780 align:start position:0%
um again I'm trying to recall off the
 
06:32:35.448 --> 06:32:35.458 align:start position:0%
top of my head but I don't believe
 
06:32:37.850 --> 06:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
private entities sort of like a bank or
 
06:32:39.350 --> 06:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh or some other entity would be
 
06:32:39.360 --> 06:32:41.530 align:start position:0%
uh or some other entity would be
eligible

06:32:41.530 --> 06:32:41.540 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
06:32:41.540 --> 06:32:43.310 align:start position:0%
eligible
follow-up

06:32:43.310 --> 06:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:32:45.110 --> 06:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
um so you you mentioned the community
 
06:32:47.030 --> 06:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
Finance Development Authority I'm a
 
06:32:47.930 --> 06:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
little bit familiar with that
 
06:32:47.940 --> 06:32:49.670 align:start position:0%
little bit familiar with that
organization

06:32:49.670 --> 06:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
organization
 
06:32:52.610 --> 06:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
um could they administer this type of
 
06:32:54.170 --> 06:32:54.180 align:start position:0%
program or would there have to be some
 
06:32:56.208 --> 06:32:56.218 align:start position:0%
change in their Charter
 
06:32:58.070 --> 06:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
I don't want to thank you for the
 
06:32:59.510 --> 06:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
question I don't want to speak on behalf
 
06:33:00.890 --> 06:33:00.900 align:start position:0%
of the Community Development Finance
 
06:33:02.510 --> 06:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
Authority or are there sort of similar
 
06:33:05.510 --> 06:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
organizations I
 
06:33:07.430 --> 06:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't believe there would be any
 
06:33:09.530 --> 06:33:09.540 align:start position:0%
restriction but again I don't know the
 
06:33:13.610 --> 06:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
the terms that govern their organization
 
06:33:15.288 --> 06:33:15.298 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:33:17.810 --> 06:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
06:33:19.070 --> 06:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
06:33:20.570 --> 06:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:33:22.850 --> 06:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
um getting back to uh the middle of uh
 
06:33:25.250 --> 06:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
page four there on Section seven so it
 
06:33:28.548 --> 06:33:28.558 align:start position:0%
gives me line 18. it talks about
 
06:33:30.410 --> 06:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
the department shall maximize the
 
06:33:32.868 --> 06:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in
 
06:33:34.548 --> 06:33:34.558 align:start position:0%
the state for every dollar deployed by
 
06:33:36.890 --> 06:33:36.900 align:start position:0%
the fund that seems to me to be an
 
06:33:38.510 --> 06:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
absolute statement that would be
 
06:33:40.910 --> 06:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
difficult to comply with because as soon
 
06:33:43.310 --> 06:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
as you come up with one idea that says
 
06:33:46.250 --> 06:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
these of all the ideas we see this will
 
06:33:48.770 --> 06:33:48.780 align:start position:0%
give us the maximum uh reduction in
 
06:33:50.690 --> 06:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases someone can come up
 
06:33:52.548 --> 06:33:52.558 align:start position:0%
with another one says oh no this one
 
06:33:54.948 --> 06:33:54.958 align:start position:0%
will do a little bit more so shouldn't
 
06:33:56.868 --> 06:33:56.878 align:start position:0%
the words be shells something like shall
 
06:34:00.530 --> 06:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
strive to maximize or shall you know
 
06:34:02.810 --> 06:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
something on that idea rather than
 
06:34:04.670 --> 06:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
making it absolute because I don't see
 
06:34:05.930 --> 06:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
how the Department's going to be able to
 
06:34:07.970 --> 06:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
deal with an absolute like that without
 
06:34:11.868 --> 06:34:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:13.970 --> 06:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question I I read
 
06:34:15.350 --> 06:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
that provision
 
06:34:18.350 --> 06:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
um as so for example if um
 
06:34:21.288 --> 06:34:21.298 align:start position:0%
I should say I read that as a sort of
 
06:34:23.690 --> 06:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
directive when the department is scoring
 
06:34:25.850 --> 06:34:25.860 align:start position:0%
or evaluating different proposals that
 
06:34:28.310 --> 06:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
come into it of that sort of of the
 
06:34:31.070 --> 06:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
primary you know the factor in scoring
 
06:34:33.530 --> 06:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
these um applications for a lack of a
 
06:34:35.208 --> 06:34:35.218 align:start position:0%
better way of describing them for
 
06:34:37.128 --> 06:34:37.138 align:start position:0%
financing that they would have they
 
06:34:39.230 --> 06:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
would have to be some Metric as part of
 
06:34:41.628 --> 06:34:41.638 align:start position:0%
our application process that would say
 
06:34:44.150 --> 06:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
okay how much how many
 
06:34:45.948 --> 06:34:45.958 align:start position:0%
um how much greenhouse gas emissions are
 
06:34:48.948 --> 06:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
you reducing so do we do you know do you
 
06:34:49.970 --> 06:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
have to go through the process of
 
06:34:51.530 --> 06:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
figuring out okay which ones are we just
 
06:34:53.030 --> 06:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
talking about carbon dioxide are we
 
06:34:55.368 --> 06:34:55.378 align:start position:0%
doing it other types of greenhouse gases
 
06:34:58.430 --> 06:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
such as methane things like that and you
 
06:35:00.170 --> 06:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
know how does this project propose to
 
06:35:02.930 --> 06:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
reduce those and by how much so there
 
06:35:04.430 --> 06:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
would certainly be some work by the
 
06:35:07.070 --> 06:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
department to try to come up with a
 
06:35:10.490 --> 06:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
an objective metric in terms of of
 
06:35:12.948 --> 06:35:12.958 align:start position:0%
having the applicant describe what kind
 
06:35:14.510 --> 06:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
of how much they're avoiding or how much
 
06:35:16.910 --> 06:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
they're preventing from being released
 
06:35:18.890 --> 06:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
um but to your point there yes somebody
 
06:35:20.390 --> 06:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
could argue well you know the
 
06:35:22.190 --> 06:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
Department's method of of evaluating
 
06:35:23.930 --> 06:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
this or saying you know using this
 
06:35:26.150 --> 06:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
Factor versus that factor uh could
 
06:35:28.850 --> 06:35:28.860 align:start position:0%
certainly be contested by applicants
 
06:35:30.650 --> 06:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
um I don't
 
06:35:32.570 --> 06:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure of an of an elegant way
 
06:35:35.270 --> 06:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
around that other than specifying
 
06:35:37.430 --> 06:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
well and
 
06:35:38.930 --> 06:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
now I couldn't I guess you couldn't even
 
06:35:40.310 --> 06:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
specify you couldn't even specify a
 
06:35:41.570 --> 06:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
number in statute and say Here's you
 
06:35:43.128 --> 06:35:43.138 align:start position:0%
know nothing below this amount it has to
 
06:35:45.170 --> 06:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
be better than this then you know then
 
06:35:48.730 --> 06:35:48.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:51.590 --> 06:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
what my concern is they is not that you
 
06:35:52.970 --> 06:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
won't have a method I understand you'll
 
06:35:55.548 --> 06:35:55.558 align:start position:0%
have to come up with some measuring uh
 
06:35:56.990 --> 06:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
device or whatever you want to cut
 
06:35:58.730 --> 06:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
criteria to decide okay this is how
 
06:36:00.350 --> 06:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're going to drop it
 
06:36:02.150 --> 06:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
into this bucket and turn the handle and
 
06:36:04.430 --> 06:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
it'll come out with a score my concern
 
06:36:07.190 --> 06:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
is that when you say you shall maximize
 
06:36:09.530 --> 06:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
you do that and you come up with you
 
06:36:12.110 --> 06:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
have 10 projects and you pick one and
 
06:36:14.150 --> 06:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
then the next day someone says well
 
06:36:15.470 --> 06:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
here's another one you didn't consider
 
06:36:17.030 --> 06:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
this you're not maximizing it because
 
06:36:19.250 --> 06:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
this one will get more I just think the
 
06:36:21.830 --> 06:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
me the words may be too absolute is what
 
06:36:23.510 --> 06:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'm referring to it needs to be
 
06:36:25.910 --> 06:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
something more like we'll strive to
 
06:36:28.430 --> 06:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
maximize or to the extent possible or
 
06:36:30.110 --> 06:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
something like that as a modifier so you
 
06:36:31.430 --> 06:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
don't get hung up with someone that
 
06:36:33.048 --> 06:36:33.058 align:start position:0%
ended up taking it to court on something
 
06:36:35.030 --> 06:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
like that that's all okay no thank you
 
06:36:36.288 --> 06:36:36.298 align:start position:0%
for the clarification I had sort of
 
06:36:37.610 --> 06:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
envisioned this as either an annual
 
06:36:39.048 --> 06:36:39.058 align:start position:0%
round or maybe a semi-annual around
 
06:36:40.850 --> 06:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
where where entities come in and apply
 
06:36:41.990 --> 06:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
and you'd have sort of a set but right
 
06:36:43.610 --> 06:36:43.620 align:start position:0%
if it's a rolling application then you
 
06:36:45.288 --> 06:36:45.298 align:start position:0%
could say have somebody come in the next
 
06:36:46.850 --> 06:36:46.860 align:start position:0%
day you know with a different Apple
 
06:36:49.010 --> 06:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
application that had it been in the the
 
06:36:50.868 --> 06:36:50.878 align:start position:0%
you know the day before with that group
 
06:36:52.970 --> 06:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
of applications you know might have
 
06:36:54.230 --> 06:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
knocked somebody else out from getting
 
06:36:57.230 --> 06:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
funded right to your point yes
 
06:36:59.208 --> 06:36:59.218 align:start position:0%
but it would all depend on how the how
 
06:37:00.410 --> 06:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
the program is structured but thank you
 
06:37:01.670 --> 06:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
that is that is important thing to
 
06:37:03.830 --> 06:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
consider representative Summers has a
 
06:37:03.840 --> 06:37:04.788 align:start position:0%
consider representative Summers has a
question

06:37:04.788 --> 06:37:04.798 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:37:06.650 --> 06:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh just a quick
 
06:37:07.970 --> 06:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
question I know I'm looking at this bill
 
06:37:10.070 --> 06:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
and I know it was submitted and printed
 
06:37:11.810 --> 06:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
before there's a fiscal note available
 
06:37:14.750 --> 06:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
so the physical note might cover this
 
06:37:17.570 --> 06:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
but I'm looking at this and seeing all
 
06:37:19.490 --> 06:37:19.500 align:start position:0%
these multiple tasks that the if you
 
06:37:20.750 --> 06:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
guys if Department of energy was
 
06:37:22.730 --> 06:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
administrating it you have many many
 
06:37:25.910 --> 06:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
tasks here to go through all these shell
 
06:37:28.128 --> 06:37:28.138 align:start position:0%
assignments that you all should do do
 
06:37:30.530 --> 06:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
you have any idea what kind of Staffing
 
06:37:33.048 --> 06:37:33.058 align:start position:0%
costs requirements what department of
 
06:37:35.510 --> 06:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
energy would need to accomplish this
 
06:37:37.128 --> 06:37:37.138 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:37:38.810 --> 06:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
um yes it would depend honestly it
 
06:37:41.690 --> 06:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
depends on what the uh the amount of the
 
06:37:43.250 --> 06:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
capitalization for the type of program
 
06:37:46.368 --> 06:37:46.378 align:start position:0%
would be if it's a lower amount
 
06:37:48.948 --> 06:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
um and with additional language we could
 
06:37:50.570 --> 06:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
potentially go out and contract for some
 
06:37:52.310 --> 06:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
of these services for the
 
06:37:54.110 --> 06:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
um for the general administration of the
 
06:37:55.670 --> 06:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
funds for example making the loans
 
06:37:57.190 --> 06:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
vetting potential
 
06:38:01.270 --> 06:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
applicants for you know Financial
 
06:38:03.708 --> 06:38:03.718 align:start position:0%
their financial their credit worthiness
 
06:38:05.570 --> 06:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
or things like that
 
06:38:07.490 --> 06:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
um as well as for the actual uh you know
 
06:38:08.990 --> 06:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
the um
 
06:38:11.208 --> 06:38:11.218 align:start position:0%
uh the the strength of the application
 
06:38:13.430 --> 06:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
on their on their merits
 
06:38:15.470 --> 06:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
um there's certainly comply certainly a
 
06:38:16.850 --> 06:38:16.860 align:start position:0%
compliance piece the department does
 
06:38:18.350 --> 06:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
this as well we have a compliance
 
06:38:19.730 --> 06:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
officer who looks at our other federal
 
06:38:21.530 --> 06:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
funds that makes sure you know we're in
 
06:38:23.690 --> 06:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
compliance with all the various
 
06:38:25.910 --> 06:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
um Federal Pro Federal requirements so
 
06:38:28.310 --> 06:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
is build America Davis bacon things like
 
06:38:30.470 --> 06:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
that um we again Davis bacon is probably
 
06:38:33.350 --> 06:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
the best example or prevailing wages
 
06:38:34.970 --> 06:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
um of where
 
06:38:37.128 --> 06:38:37.138 align:start position:0%
um we may we if depending on the size of
 
06:38:38.750 --> 06:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
the fund we may have a dedicated person
 
06:38:41.030 --> 06:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
who would be hired to just keep track of
 
06:38:42.650 --> 06:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
those things but
 
06:38:44.150 --> 06:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
um so I apologize for the long-winded
 
06:38:45.410 --> 06:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
answer but it would honestly it all
 
06:38:46.850 --> 06:38:46.860 align:start position:0%
comes down to you know are we talking
 
06:38:48.948 --> 06:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
about a one million dollar fund are we
 
06:38:50.570 --> 06:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
talking about a 10 million dollar fund
 
06:38:52.368 --> 06:38:52.378 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars so it would staff
 
06:38:53.990 --> 06:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
would have to scale depending on the
 
06:38:54.000 --> 06:38:55.910 align:start position:0%
would have to scale depending on the
size

06:38:55.910 --> 06:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
size
 
06:38:58.910 --> 06:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
so I apologize for the non-answer answer
 
06:39:01.070 --> 06:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative Harrington thought
 
06:39:03.110 --> 06:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
of another question yeah just a
 
06:39:05.448 --> 06:39:05.458 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that uh regardless of how
 
06:39:08.930 --> 06:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
it's done does the federal money pay for
 
06:39:11.448 --> 06:39:11.458 align:start position:0%
whether it's additional staff or we have
 
06:39:13.490 --> 06:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
you contracted out can we use that money
 
06:39:15.948 --> 06:39:15.958 align:start position:0%
to pay for the service to to run this
 
06:39:17.510 --> 06:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
program or does that have to be State
 
06:39:17.520 --> 06:39:18.830 align:start position:0%
program or does that have to be State
funds

06:39:18.830 --> 06:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
funds
 
06:39:21.048 --> 06:39:21.058 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking and again it will
 
06:39:23.270 --> 06:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
determine it will be determined by all
 
06:39:24.770 --> 06:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
of the federal guidance that comes out
 
06:39:26.570 --> 06:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
surrounding these programs generally
 
06:39:28.010 --> 06:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
speaking I don't think I've seen a
 
06:39:29.448 --> 06:39:29.458 align:start position:0%
single federal program where they've
 
06:39:31.490 --> 06:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
said no the state needs to kick in for
 
06:39:33.410 --> 06:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
the uh administrative costs usually
 
06:39:35.030 --> 06:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's a portion
 
06:39:37.910 --> 06:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
um of the uh of any federal allocation
 
06:39:39.708 --> 06:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
that is a lot better allowed for
 
06:39:41.448 --> 06:39:41.458 align:start position:0%
administrative expenses so whether it's
 
06:39:43.190 --> 06:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
on administrative expenses on the part
 
06:39:46.610 --> 06:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
of the department or on a sub grantee
 
06:39:47.810 --> 06:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
um there are usually Provisions that
 
06:39:50.330 --> 06:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
allow for that follow-up follow-up I
 
06:39:52.368 --> 06:39:52.378 align:start position:0%
just we that's a key point we obviously
 
06:39:53.868 --> 06:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
have to know the answer to that question
 
06:39:56.570 --> 06:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
before we vote on this bill so I can I
 
06:39:57.830 --> 06:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
can do some further research and get an
 
06:40:00.350 --> 06:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
answer for you thank you representative
 
06:40:03.948 --> 06:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:05.810 --> 06:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Wells and thank you for
 
06:40:07.670 --> 06:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
being here today
 
06:40:10.250 --> 06:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
um page three line 35 speaks of
 
06:40:11.628 --> 06:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
partnering with private Capital
 
06:40:13.850 --> 06:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
providers and capital markets to attract
 
06:40:16.610 --> 06:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
co-investment from private Banks goes on
 
06:40:19.128 --> 06:40:19.138 align:start position:0%
page four line 30 says the department
 
06:40:22.010 --> 06:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
May accept and use philanthropic funds
 
06:40:24.470 --> 06:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
and looking for the best fit for a
 
06:40:26.208 --> 06:40:26.218 align:start position:0%
program of this nature
 
06:40:28.128 --> 06:40:28.138 align:start position:0%
do you think the uh
 
06:40:29.868 --> 06:40:29.878 align:start position:0%
Department of energy will be capable of
 
06:40:31.970 --> 06:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
seeking out these private and
 
06:40:34.368 --> 06:40:34.378 align:start position:0%
philanthropic funds
 
06:40:34.378 --> 06:40:36.048 align:start position:0%
philanthropic funds
okay

06:40:36.048 --> 06:40:36.058 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:40:36.058 --> 06:40:39.190 align:start position:0%
okay
yeah

06:40:39.190 --> 06:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:41.990 --> 06:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a unique space where I
 
06:40:43.788 --> 06:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
don't know if I you know another state
 
06:40:46.670 --> 06:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
agency would be a better fit Des does
 
06:40:48.530 --> 06:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
revolving loan funds but they just there
 
06:40:50.750 --> 06:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
for water and sewer uh or clean water
 
06:40:52.490 --> 06:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
grants I should say
 
06:40:54.350 --> 06:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
um but those really don't leverage a lot
 
06:40:55.910 --> 06:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
of private funds it's all you know
 
06:40:57.948 --> 06:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
either Municipal funds or if it's State
 
06:41:00.288 --> 06:41:00.298 align:start position:0%
dollars going into these funds
 
06:41:04.128 --> 06:41:04.138 align:start position:0%
um I had uh
 
06:41:06.708 --> 06:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
in terms of private you know if if the
 
06:41:08.390 --> 06:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
department were tasks are doing this I'm
 
06:41:09.890 --> 06:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
certainly I'm sure that we would hire
 
06:41:11.150 --> 06:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
the right staff to make sure that we're
 
06:41:12.890 --> 06:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
going out and doing all of these kinds
 
06:41:16.970 --> 06:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
of things part of it may just be a
 
06:41:19.730 --> 06:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
um a requirement on the applicant's part
 
06:41:22.010 --> 06:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
of where they're showing okay you're
 
06:41:24.470 --> 06:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
coming in for a loan for maybe three
 
06:41:26.270 --> 06:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
quarters of the cost or half the cost or
 
06:41:27.650 --> 06:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
something like that but they've said
 
06:41:30.110 --> 06:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
okay we've gone out to our bank and
 
06:41:31.548 --> 06:41:31.558 align:start position:0%
they're willing to put up some money or
 
06:41:34.010 --> 06:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
they've gotten a grant from you know in
 
06:41:35.510 --> 06:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire maybe it's
 
06:41:37.010 --> 06:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
um you know Northern borders Regional
 
06:41:37.970 --> 06:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
Commission they're doing a project
 
06:41:39.530 --> 06:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
they've managed to get a grant for that
 
06:41:39.540 --> 06:41:40.670 align:start position:0%
they've managed to get a grant for that
so

06:41:40.670 --> 06:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:41:40.680 --> 06:41:41.208 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:41:41.208 --> 06:41:41.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:41:42.530 --> 06:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
and then we sort of talk about you know
 
06:41:43.610 --> 06:41:43.620 align:start position:0%
skin of the game right there have
 
06:41:44.810 --> 06:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
there's something else that's going on
 
06:41:46.010 --> 06:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
they're sort of putting together These
 
06:41:47.628 --> 06:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
funds that you know a lot of projects in
 
06:41:49.250 --> 06:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are sort of based off of
 
06:41:50.390 --> 06:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
where I get a little bit from here a
 
06:41:51.350 --> 06:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
little bit here from a little bit from
 
06:41:51.360 --> 06:41:52.310 align:start position:0%
little bit here from a little bit from
here

06:41:52.310 --> 06:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:41:53.868 --> 06:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
um so I sort of viewed that as sort of
 
06:41:54.948 --> 06:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
06:41:56.208 --> 06:41:56.218 align:start position:0%
um but certainly as some of the project
 
06:41:58.788 --> 06:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
like because this is is stood up and
 
06:42:00.410 --> 06:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
works its way out and it becomes more
 
06:42:02.208 --> 06:42:02.218 align:start position:0%
mature you know private Capital I'm
 
06:42:04.368 --> 06:42:04.378 align:start position:0%
assuming would would come in and other
 
06:42:05.810 --> 06:42:05.820 align:start position:0%
um entities although it's a little bit
 
06:42:06.948 --> 06:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
hard when you're dealing with just
 
06:42:10.070 --> 06:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
purely alone program of where
 
06:42:11.448 --> 06:42:11.458 align:start position:0%
um folks will come in and say well it's
 
06:42:12.890 --> 06:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
like oh well you know I would like a you
 
06:42:14.570 --> 06:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
know alone 100 from you rather than
 
06:42:16.610 --> 06:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
trying to find you know alone here alone
 
06:42:18.288 --> 06:42:18.298 align:start position:0%
here and alone here and then that the
 
06:42:19.548 --> 06:42:19.558 align:start position:0%
financing gets a little bit messy and
 
06:42:20.750 --> 06:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with different terms and
 
06:42:23.030 --> 06:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
conditions and things like that I will
 
06:42:24.650 --> 06:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
say with federal funds as soon as a
 
06:42:26.330 --> 06:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
dollar federal funds goes into a project
 
06:42:29.208 --> 06:42:29.218 align:start position:0%
all the other strings come along with it
 
06:42:31.670 --> 06:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
um so there is sort of a of a um
 
06:42:34.548 --> 06:42:34.558 align:start position:0%
reluctance on the part of of some uh
 
06:42:37.610 --> 06:42:37.620 align:start position:0%
financial institutions for
 
06:42:39.110 --> 06:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
um being part not necessarily being
 
06:42:40.730 --> 06:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
Partners in projects when it comes to
 
06:42:42.708 --> 06:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
federal funds but having all those other
 
06:42:44.570 --> 06:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
strings attached sort of when if the
 
06:42:45.948 --> 06:42:45.958 align:start position:0%
bank had just made the loan to another
 
06:42:47.930 --> 06:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
entity 100 they don't need to worry
 
06:42:49.970 --> 06:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
about all those compliance concerns
 
06:42:51.948 --> 06:42:51.958 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
06:42:54.708 --> 06:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
06:42:57.770 --> 06:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair when a a similar Bill to
 
06:42:59.510 --> 06:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
this was introduced I think it was last
 
06:43:02.448 --> 06:43:02.458 align:start position:0%
session there were some concerns raised
 
06:43:02.458 --> 06:43:03.410 align:start position:0%
session there were some concerns raised
about

06:43:03.410 --> 06:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:43:06.410 --> 06:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
um language in that bill that might
 
06:43:06.420 --> 06:43:07.070 align:start position:0%
um language in that bill that might
um

06:43:07.070 --> 06:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:09.288 --> 06:43:09.298 align:start position:0%
be discriminatory in terms of
 
06:43:11.270 --> 06:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
discriminating against certain in favor
 
06:43:12.890 --> 06:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
of certain people or against certain
 
06:43:15.170 --> 06:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
people groups of people is there
 
06:43:17.990 --> 06:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
anything in this bill that that concerns
 
06:43:20.150 --> 06:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
you from that point of view is there
 
06:43:21.230 --> 06:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
anything that you would consider
 
06:43:21.240 --> 06:43:23.390 align:start position:0%
anything that you would consider
discriminatory

06:43:23.390 --> 06:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
discriminatory
 
06:43:26.750 --> 06:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:29.390 --> 06:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
I hadn't taken a read of it in that
 
06:43:31.730 --> 06:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
using that sort of lens but nothing off
 
06:43:34.190 --> 06:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
the top of my head looks that way
 
06:43:35.690 --> 06:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
um in reading through
 
06:43:38.690 --> 06:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
um I to to the to your question I don't
 
06:43:41.090 --> 06:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
know what the specific
 
06:43:43.128 --> 06:43:43.138 align:start position:0%
charge was that potentially could
 
06:43:44.690 --> 06:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
potentially be discriminatory so I guess
 
06:43:47.330 --> 06:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how to answer that question
 
06:43:50.750 --> 06:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:52.250 --> 06:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
it's very representative Wendy Thomas
 
06:43:55.190 --> 06:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chair
 
06:43:57.890 --> 06:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
um we currently have a water fund that's
 
06:43:59.930 --> 06:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
similar it's a bunch of money and a
 
06:43:59.940 --> 06:44:00.910 align:start position:0%
similar it's a bunch of money and a
committee

06:44:00.910 --> 06:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:44:03.770 --> 06:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
allocates loans and grants based on
 
06:44:06.910 --> 06:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
applications do you see this as being
 
06:44:09.948 --> 06:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
committee driven to make the decisions
 
06:44:11.810 --> 06:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
on applications or would the decisions
 
06:44:15.048 --> 06:44:15.058 align:start position:0%
be solely made by the DOE
 
06:44:16.368 --> 06:44:16.378 align:start position:0%
um so I'm glad you brought that up so
 
06:44:17.510 --> 06:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming you're referring to the
 
06:44:18.650 --> 06:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
drinking water groundwater trust fund
 
06:44:21.048 --> 06:44:21.058 align:start position:0%
advisory commission so I'm actually a
 
06:44:23.390 --> 06:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
member of that commission so
 
06:44:24.890 --> 06:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
um I work with Senator Morris to set it
 
06:44:26.150 --> 06:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
up when I worked for the Senate and then
 
06:44:27.890 --> 06:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
when I left and came over to doe they
 
06:44:29.750 --> 06:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to keep me around so I got an
 
06:44:31.310 --> 06:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
appointment to it
 
06:44:33.890 --> 06:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
um honestly it could go either way
 
06:44:36.770 --> 06:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
um if the if it will the legislatures to
 
06:44:38.208 --> 06:44:38.218 align:start position:0%
set up sort of a similar Commission of
 
06:44:39.470 --> 06:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
where you have sort of a broad range of
 
06:44:41.170 --> 06:44:41.180 align:start position:0%
folks who are evaluating these
 
06:44:44.208 --> 06:44:44.218 align:start position:0%
applications I will say as a member of
 
06:44:45.948 --> 06:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
the commission we rely heavily on the
 
06:44:48.288 --> 06:44:48.298 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services for
 
06:44:49.910 --> 06:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of sort of either the history
 
06:44:52.310 --> 06:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
around the around the project or other
 
06:44:53.990 --> 06:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
things that we may not be considering
 
06:44:56.208 --> 06:44:56.218 align:start position:0%
because I will say I'm I'm not an expert
 
06:44:57.830 --> 06:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
on all the engineering that goes into
 
06:44:59.690 --> 06:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
various water projects or sort of the
 
06:45:00.948 --> 06:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
stories that come along with some of
 
06:45:01.850 --> 06:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
them other than what's in the
 
06:45:03.708 --> 06:45:03.718 align:start position:0%
application in front of me
 
06:45:06.230 --> 06:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
um that being said that sort of
 
06:45:07.910 --> 06:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
structure I found is very unique in
 
06:45:09.048 --> 06:45:09.058 align:start position:0%
terms of state government where there's
 
06:45:11.390 --> 06:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
not a lot of other state agencies that
 
06:45:12.948 --> 06:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
have sort of Advisory Board telling them
 
06:45:16.190 --> 06:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
how to spend their their money
 
06:45:18.470 --> 06:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
um that being said I don't I wouldn't I
 
06:45:19.430 --> 06:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
don't think the department would have a
 
06:45:20.868 --> 06:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
strong opinion one way or the other on
 
06:45:22.368 --> 06:45:22.378 align:start position:0%
it but being a member of the commission
 
06:45:23.750 --> 06:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
I certainly
 
06:45:25.730 --> 06:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
um I view it as useful but not
 
06:45:28.730 --> 06:45:28.740 align:start position:0%
necessarily a requirement uh follow-up
 
06:45:31.490 --> 06:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you um you mentioned uh
 
06:45:32.810 --> 06:45:32.820 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
06:45:34.970 --> 06:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
would you be working in conjunction with
 
06:45:38.510 --> 06:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
Des for this for this project oh there
 
06:45:41.030 --> 06:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
we go speak the devil
 
06:45:42.830 --> 06:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
um I guess the answer you must have
 
06:45:45.410 --> 06:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:47.150 --> 06:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
um certainly you know we would be we'd
 
06:45:48.650 --> 06:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
be working with other uh certainly with
 
06:45:50.750 --> 06:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
with other state agencies
 
06:45:52.788 --> 06:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
um you know Des has a lot of valuable
 
06:45:54.470 --> 06:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
experience when it comes to revolving
 
06:45:56.750 --> 06:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
loan funds in terms of structuring um
 
06:45:58.250 --> 06:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
sort of the mechanics behind that I know
 
06:46:00.410 --> 06:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
Sue Carlson is certainly an expert on
 
06:46:01.910 --> 06:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
those things we would certainly relying
 
06:46:04.250 --> 06:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
on on that knowledge but
 
06:46:05.990 --> 06:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of sort of an
 
06:46:07.548 --> 06:46:07.558 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee when it comes to
 
06:46:08.930 --> 06:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
reducing you know greenhouse gas
 
06:46:10.670 --> 06:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
emissions you know it certainly would we
 
06:46:11.990 --> 06:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
would be collaborative in talking to our
 
06:46:14.628 --> 06:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
folk to our friends over at DES
 
06:46:14.638 --> 06:46:15.288 align:start position:0%
folk to our friends over at DES
um

06:46:15.288 --> 06:46:15.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:16.490 --> 06:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure they would appreciate
 
06:46:18.288 --> 06:46:18.298 align:start position:0%
hearing from us as well thank you thank
 
06:46:19.310 --> 06:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
you very much not to put them on the
 
06:46:19.320 --> 06:46:20.090 align:start position:0%
you very much not to put them on the
spot

06:46:20.090 --> 06:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
spot
 
06:46:21.770 --> 06:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:46:25.030 --> 06:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions
 
06:46:27.288 --> 06:46:27.298 align:start position:0%
representative Jack has a question thank
 
06:46:28.670 --> 06:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
06:46:30.288 --> 06:46:30.298 align:start position:0%
bringing up the srfs I was trying to
 
06:46:31.788 --> 06:46:31.798 align:start position:0%
figure out how to get that in there in
 
06:46:33.468 --> 06:46:33.478 align:start position:0%
the form of a question wouldn't you
 
06:46:35.270 --> 06:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
agree with me that the the
 
06:46:37.190 --> 06:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
administration of the this is the clean
 
06:46:40.730 --> 06:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
and Wastewater estate resolve revolving
 
06:46:43.310 --> 06:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
loan funds that come to our committee uh
 
06:46:44.750 --> 06:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
Public Works committee wouldn't you
 
06:46:47.390 --> 06:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
agree that that this is their sort of a
 
06:46:49.910 --> 06:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
worked example for how this could work
 
06:46:52.128 --> 06:46:52.138 align:start position:0%
uh yes I think they would probably they
 
06:46:53.930 --> 06:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
would provide a valuable example of of
 
06:46:55.788 --> 06:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
using federal dollars and using them as
 
06:46:59.270 --> 06:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
a large revolving Loan Fund within state
 
06:46:59.280 --> 06:47:02.270 align:start position:0%
a large revolving Loan Fund within state
government

06:47:02.270 --> 06:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:05.690 --> 06:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
thank you just as a reminder to
 
06:47:07.730 --> 06:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
or as a point of information for
 
06:47:10.548 --> 06:47:10.558 align:start position:0%
visitors to our committee we do not
 
06:47:13.368 --> 06:47:13.378 align:start position:0%
permit would you believe or do you agree
 
06:47:15.890 --> 06:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
with me kind of questions my apologies
 
06:47:18.170 --> 06:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman not that's not your fault
 
06:47:18.180 --> 06:47:19.490 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman not that's not your fault
okay

06:47:19.490 --> 06:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:47:21.048 --> 06:47:21.058 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further questions
 
06:47:23.150 --> 06:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
for Mr Elliott we want to thank you for
 
06:47:25.250 --> 06:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
providing the Department's perspective
 
06:47:27.350 --> 06:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
on this proposed legislation thank you
 
06:47:29.270 --> 06:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman thank you and I'd
 
06:47:32.390 --> 06:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
like to call the final speaker for this
 
06:47:35.090 --> 06:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
bill that's Sam Evans Brown from clean
 
06:47:37.128 --> 06:47:37.138 align:start position:0%
energy New Hampshire
 
06:47:42.650 --> 06:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:44.330 --> 06:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
I have some written testimony they could
 
06:47:45.830 --> 06:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
submit but actually many of the points
 
06:47:47.448 --> 06:47:47.458 align:start position:0%
have been addressed already so I'll I'll
 
06:47:50.330 --> 06:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
hold off until uh uh speaking my name is
 
06:47:51.530 --> 06:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
Sam Evans Brown I'm the executive
 
06:47:53.868 --> 06:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
director of clean energy New Hampshire
 
06:47:58.070 --> 06:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to say put a uh uh
 
06:48:01.070 --> 06:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
put a emphasis on two points here one is
 
06:48:02.750 --> 06:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
just the quantity of dollars that we're
 
06:48:05.448 --> 06:48:05.458 align:start position:0%
talking about which I think there's the
 
06:48:08.868 --> 06:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
potential that if uh if I'm doing my
 
06:48:10.968 --> 06:48:10.978 align:start position:0%
math right we might be talking more than
 
06:48:12.650 --> 06:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
tens of millions of dollars that could
 
06:48:14.208 --> 06:48:14.218 align:start position:0%
flow into the state through this through
 
06:48:15.948 --> 06:48:15.958 align:start position:0%
this fund so if we look at the formula
 
06:48:17.330 --> 06:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
grants that the state is eligible for
 
06:48:19.430 --> 06:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
that just come to the state uh
 
06:48:21.410 --> 06:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
automatically as long as they submit a
 
06:48:23.030 --> 06:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
submit a proposal that meets with
 
06:48:25.548 --> 06:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines uh thinking of the
 
06:48:27.650 --> 06:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
the homes program and the HERO program
 
06:48:29.030 --> 06:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
which are both part of the inflation
 
06:48:31.548 --> 06:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
reduction act those together and Josh
 
06:48:32.750 --> 06:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
can correct me from the back of the room
 
06:48:34.910 --> 06:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
I think are in the 70 million dollar
 
06:48:37.910 --> 06:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
range and that that larger pot of money
 
06:48:40.310 --> 06:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
did I get a thumbs up from Josh yeah
 
06:48:42.890 --> 06:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
okay right uh and that larger pot of
 
06:48:44.990 --> 06:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
money is around nine billion dollars and
 
06:48:46.070 --> 06:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
so when we're talking about a pot of
 
06:48:48.590 --> 06:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
money that's 20 billion dollars
 
06:48:50.930 --> 06:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
um you can think roughly double uh might
 
06:48:52.610 --> 06:48:52.620 align:start position:0%
be available to each state and then if
 
06:48:54.230 --> 06:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
you consider that this is a competitive
 
06:48:56.150 --> 06:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
Grant process and some states will not
 
06:48:57.830 --> 06:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
be awarded funds we might be talking
 
06:49:01.010 --> 06:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
about even more and so in preparation
 
06:49:02.448 --> 06:49:02.458 align:start position:0%
for this hearing I've been reaching out
 
06:49:04.850 --> 06:49:04.860 align:start position:0%
to a number of uh non-profits and other
 
06:49:06.708 --> 06:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
entities that might be eligible for this
 
06:49:08.570 --> 06:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
type of funding the the business Finance
 
06:49:10.250 --> 06:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
Authority I think is one that leaps to
 
06:49:11.090 --> 06:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
mind we've talked about the community
 
06:49:12.410 --> 06:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
developments Finance Authority already
 
06:49:14.990 --> 06:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh the Community Loan Fund is one that I
 
06:49:17.510 --> 06:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
thought of and I will confess that my
 
06:49:19.310 --> 06:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
organization actually responded to the
 
06:49:21.230 --> 06:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
the RFI that the federal government put
 
06:49:24.048 --> 06:49:24.058 align:start position:0%
out in December uh because it might even
 
06:49:25.610 --> 06:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
be that my organization might be
 
06:49:27.650 --> 06:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
eligible for some of this funding
 
06:49:29.868 --> 06:49:29.878 align:start position:0%
um and all this is to say that that I
 
06:49:31.788 --> 06:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
think the the quantity of money
 
06:49:35.448 --> 06:49:35.458 align:start position:0%
available and the uncertainty as to as
 
06:49:38.270 --> 06:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
to uh who can apply for it and and
 
06:49:40.070 --> 06:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
whether and what the appropriate
 
06:49:42.288 --> 06:49:42.298 align:start position:0%
entities to apply for it is really does
 
06:49:44.810 --> 06:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
beg for a rigorous process in this
 
06:49:47.030 --> 06:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
committee to answer the questions around
 
06:49:49.430 --> 06:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
this funding source and whether or not
 
06:49:51.170 --> 06:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
we have the appropriate enabling
 
06:49:54.350 --> 06:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
statutory language to to uh ensure that
 
06:49:55.968 --> 06:49:55.978 align:start position:0%
this this money does come to the state
 
06:49:57.770 --> 06:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire from my mind there
 
06:49:59.448 --> 06:49:59.458 align:start position:0%
there's a number of ways that this
 
06:50:01.548 --> 06:50:01.558 align:start position:0%
committee could go if if we were to
 
06:50:03.530 --> 06:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
engage in in a real robust robust
 
06:50:05.750 --> 06:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
process and answer those questions if
 
06:50:07.310 --> 06:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
the money could be housed within a state
 
06:50:08.930 --> 06:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
agency the department of energy or
 
06:50:10.390 --> 06:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
another state agency
 
06:50:13.610 --> 06:50:13.620 align:start position:0%
there could be there could be a a new
 
06:50:15.288 --> 06:50:15.298 align:start position:0%
entity created within something like the
 
06:50:16.850 --> 06:50:16.860 align:start position:0%
department of the treasury which I know
 
06:50:18.110 --> 06:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
some other states have done for their
 
06:50:20.510 --> 06:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
Green Banks or there might Simply Be
 
06:50:23.570 --> 06:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
enabling language necessary for some of
 
06:50:25.788 --> 06:50:25.798 align:start position:0%
the state's non-profits to be able to uh
 
06:50:27.288 --> 06:50:27.298 align:start position:0%
to go after the these funds
 
06:50:27.298 --> 06:50:28.968 align:start position:0%
to go after the these funds
independently

06:50:28.968 --> 06:50:28.978 align:start position:0%
independently
 
06:50:31.430 --> 06:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
um I think uh based on the timeline that
 
06:50:33.708 --> 06:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
I have seen so a federal request for
 
06:50:36.288 --> 06:50:36.298 align:start position:0%
information was issued in November uh
 
06:50:40.430 --> 06:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
the that RFI closed in December and I as
 
06:50:41.930 --> 06:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
I was sitting here I was reminding
 
06:50:45.948 --> 06:50:45.958 align:start position:0%
myself that uh that that the the uh the
 
06:50:48.650 --> 06:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
guidance the um the recommendations from
 
06:50:51.048 --> 06:50:51.058 align:start position:0%
the efab which I forgetting what that
 
06:50:52.670 --> 06:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
acronym stands for but it's the federal
 
06:50:54.350 --> 06:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
entity that was that is providing
 
06:50:56.510 --> 06:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
guidance to the EPA on how to administer
 
06:50:58.250 --> 06:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
this money was supposed to come out in
 
06:50:59.930 --> 06:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
December and I looked it up and and
 
06:51:02.208 --> 06:51:02.218 align:start position:0%
there's a 700 page list of
 
06:51:03.948 --> 06:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
recommendations that that came out just
 
06:51:06.708 --> 06:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago so all this is to say this
 
06:51:09.230 --> 06:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
is still quite fresh and I think that if
 
06:51:10.788 --> 06:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
this committee is serious about making
 
06:51:12.708 --> 06:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
sure that we're that we're getting back
 
06:51:15.230 --> 06:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
all the federal funding that we can uh
 
06:51:18.110 --> 06:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
that we we really ought to dig deep on
 
06:51:21.048 --> 06:51:21.058 align:start position:0%
this issue and ask what we can do to
 
06:51:25.070 --> 06:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:27.350 --> 06:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
you said you had two points did you make
 
06:51:30.530 --> 06:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
them both uh uh I think I think that was
 
06:51:33.230 --> 06:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
it yes so so it's a lot of money uh and
 
06:51:35.090 --> 06:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
it's quite complicated and we and we
 
06:51:37.310 --> 06:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
really ought to investigate how to how
 
06:51:39.368 --> 06:51:39.378 align:start position:0%
to best go after that money got it
 
06:51:41.570 --> 06:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
06:51:43.610 --> 06:51:43.620 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
06:51:46.010 --> 06:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm just curious
 
06:51:48.650 --> 06:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
um since your agency might have uh
 
06:51:52.250 --> 06:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
already applied for some funds that it's
 
06:51:53.448 --> 06:51:53.458 align:start position:0%
not open yet
 
06:51:54.948 --> 06:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
um we we answered a request for
 
06:51:57.770 --> 06:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
information okay a simple question are
 
06:52:00.350 --> 06:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
you aware if any of these any of the
 
06:52:02.570 --> 06:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
funds that might be available to anyone
 
06:52:06.350 --> 06:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
could they be used for say um affecting
 
06:52:06.360 --> 06:52:07.788 align:start position:0%
could they be used for say um affecting
policies

06:52:07.788 --> 06:52:07.798 align:start position:0%
policies
 
06:52:10.548 --> 06:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
uh so I believe that the answer to that
 
06:52:12.590 --> 06:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
is no uh so the re the reason that we
 
06:52:14.570 --> 06:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
responded is because another substantial
 
06:52:16.190 --> 06:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
portion of clean energy New Hampshire's
 
06:52:17.990 --> 06:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
operations is we provide technical
 
06:52:20.208 --> 06:52:20.218 align:start position:0%
assistance to municipalities
 
06:52:21.708 --> 06:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
um so we employ what are called circuit
 
06:52:24.110 --> 06:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
Riders who do grant writing for towns in
 
06:52:26.390 --> 06:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
order to pursue competitive grants so
 
06:52:29.030 --> 06:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
that they can you know reduce their for
 
06:52:30.350 --> 06:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
instance White Mountain Regional High
 
06:52:32.150 --> 06:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
School we helped write a grant for White
 
06:52:33.410 --> 06:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
Mountain Regional High School that
 
06:52:35.270 --> 06:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
helped to get a hundred thousand dollar
 
06:52:37.548 --> 06:52:37.558 align:start position:0%
USDA Grant to swap out their lights for
 
06:52:39.410 --> 06:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
for LEDs and that's that's part of what
 
06:52:41.930 --> 06:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
we do and that's that's what uh that's
 
06:52:47.090 --> 06:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:49.610 --> 06:52:49.620 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative munz
 
06:52:51.650 --> 06:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chair and
 
06:52:53.570 --> 06:52:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in so if I
 
06:52:56.930 --> 06:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
understood your your testimony correctly
 
06:52:56.940 --> 06:52:59.330 align:start position:0%
understood your your testimony correctly
um

06:52:59.330 --> 06:52:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:01.670 --> 06:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
the way that this bill is structured
 
06:53:05.448 --> 06:53:05.458 align:start position:0%
where it creates a revolving fund within
 
06:53:08.930 --> 06:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
the department of energy may not be may
 
06:53:13.010 --> 06:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
not necessarily be the best or right way
 
06:53:14.930 --> 06:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
to go about taking advantage of this
 
06:53:17.390 --> 06:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
money is that correct that's right
 
06:53:20.390 --> 06:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
um and in order to know for sure we may
 
06:53:22.190 --> 06:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
actually need to wait a little bit until
 
06:53:24.230 --> 06:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
the federal guidance document comes out
 
06:53:27.350 --> 06:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
as you heard Josh Elliott allude to the
 
06:53:29.510 --> 06:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
the actual guidance document as to how
 
06:53:31.010 --> 06:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
these funds will be spent has not been
 
06:53:33.110 --> 06:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
created yet we just have a very long set
 
06:53:35.690 --> 06:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
of recommendations that will ultimately
 
06:53:37.788 --> 06:53:37.798 align:start position:0%
result in that guidance document
 
06:53:41.150 --> 06:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
06:53:44.510 --> 06:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
so that would suggest I think
 
06:53:47.810 --> 06:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill to enable us to look
 
06:53:50.030 --> 06:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
at it over the course of the summer as
 
06:53:52.788 --> 06:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
things evolve uh that that might be one
 
06:53:56.150 --> 06:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
way to go I would you know I I don't
 
06:53:57.650 --> 06:53:57.660 align:start position:0%
know if you're looking for my suggestion
 
06:54:00.468 --> 06:54:00.478 align:start position:0%
about how how to to go from here but if
 
06:54:03.170 --> 06:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
I would say if I were in your shoes I I
 
06:54:05.930 --> 06:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
would want to bring a number of entities
 
06:54:07.910 --> 06:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
that that know more about this program
 
06:54:10.128 --> 06:54:10.138 align:start position:0%
before the committee perhaps before a
 
06:54:12.170 --> 06:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which I know has been done
 
06:54:13.788 --> 06:54:13.798 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
06:54:16.010 --> 06:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
um because it may be that the timeline
 
06:54:17.570 --> 06:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
is tight enough that if you were to
 
06:54:19.490 --> 06:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
retain the bill over the summer you may
 
06:54:21.410 --> 06:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
miss an opportunity if the if the
 
06:54:23.208 --> 06:54:23.218 align:start position:0%
funding were to become available over
 
06:54:25.930 --> 06:54:25.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:30.890 --> 06:54:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:33.170 --> 06:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
his question's already been answered
 
06:54:36.468 --> 06:54:36.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:36.478 --> 06:54:38.690 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:54:38.690 --> 06:54:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:41.330 --> 06:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions I want to
 
06:54:44.030 --> 06:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming to talk to us today
 
06:54:47.030 --> 06:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
and giving the clean energy
 
06:54:50.270 --> 06:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
perspective on this bill
 
06:54:53.270 --> 06:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
so with regard to the question that
 
06:54:55.430 --> 06:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative muns just brought up
 
06:54:58.190 --> 06:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
about retaining the bill I will make
 
06:55:00.708 --> 06:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
note of the fact that this is one of our
 
06:55:03.230 --> 06:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
five early bills
 
06:55:06.288 --> 06:55:06.298 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to
 
06:55:09.948 --> 06:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
make a decision to retain the bill
 
06:55:11.868 --> 06:55:11.878 align:start position:0%
well whatever decision we make it it's
 
06:55:13.788 --> 06:55:13.798 align:start position:0%
going to be done on Friday of this week
 
06:55:17.330 --> 06:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
because we're doing all the early bills
 
06:55:19.910 --> 06:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
on Friday of this week so we have to
 
06:55:22.368 --> 06:55:22.378 align:start position:0%
decide as a committee whether we want to
 
06:55:24.590 --> 06:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
retain it or
 
06:55:27.288 --> 06:55:27.298 align:start position:0%
just pass it and see what happens after
 
06:55:27.298 --> 06:55:28.430 align:start position:0%
just pass it and see what happens after
that

06:55:28.430 --> 06:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:55:28.440 --> 06:55:29.570 align:start position:0%
that
um

06:55:29.570 --> 06:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:55:32.090 --> 06:55:32.100 align:start position:0%
representative munz thank you Mr chair
 
06:55:34.010 --> 06:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
for clarifying that I just wanted to be
 
06:55:36.048 --> 06:55:36.058 align:start position:0%
clear that I was I was not necessarily
 
06:55:40.510 --> 06:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
recommending that I was just speculating
 
06:55:44.270 --> 06:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
well we have three minutes before the
 
06:55:46.190 --> 06:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
end of the public hearing and what we
 
06:55:48.048 --> 06:55:48.058 align:start position:0%
don't typically talks among amongst
 
06:55:50.330 --> 06:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
ourselves about bills during a public
 
06:55:50.340 --> 06:55:51.530 align:start position:0%
ourselves about bills during a public
hearing

06:55:51.530 --> 06:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
06:55:54.708 --> 06:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
I would be interested to know with a
 
06:55:57.048 --> 06:55:57.058 align:start position:0%
show of hands if people were interested
 
06:56:00.170 --> 06:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
in retaining this bill
 
06:56:00.180 --> 06:56:03.048 align:start position:0%
in retaining this bill
or

06:56:03.048 --> 06:56:03.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:05.750 --> 06:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
passing judgment on it yay or nay one
 
06:56:08.628 --> 06:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
way or the other on Friday
 
06:56:10.968 --> 06:56:10.978 align:start position:0%
well no I'm not voting I have a question
 
06:56:13.070 --> 06:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
06:56:15.048 --> 06:56:15.058 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you when you say
 
06:56:17.930 --> 06:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
retain does that include a committee a
 
06:56:20.990 --> 06:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yes we form subcommittees
 
06:56:24.048 --> 06:56:24.058 align:start position:0%
when we retain bills yes
 
06:56:26.690 --> 06:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
06:56:28.968 --> 06:56:28.978 align:start position:0%
yeah as I said I think this uh some
 
06:56:30.468 --> 06:56:30.478 align:start position:0%
questions that we need to have answered
 
06:56:32.868 --> 06:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
before we can act on this legislation I
 
06:56:36.410 --> 06:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
mean maybe it's routine that they have
 
06:56:38.510 --> 06:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
funding for Staffing when they give you
 
06:56:41.030 --> 06:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
money but maybe it's not and since we
 
06:56:42.468 --> 06:56:42.478 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that question I
 
06:56:44.270 --> 06:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
certainly couldn't vote for a bill that
 
06:56:46.490 --> 06:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
may require us to spend extra State
 
06:56:49.128 --> 06:56:49.138 align:start position:0%
money and don't know how much or how
 
06:56:51.170 --> 06:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
little or whatever right now this is
 
06:56:53.208 --> 06:56:53.218 align:start position:0%
pretty wide open the money's there but
 
06:56:54.770 --> 06:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
no one seems I mean we've heard ranges
 
06:56:57.288 --> 06:56:57.298 align:start position:0%
from you know one million to tens and
 
06:56:59.390 --> 06:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
tens of millions so I think until we get
 
06:57:01.548 --> 06:57:01.558 align:start position:0%
more information it just would be it
 
06:57:03.048 --> 06:57:03.058 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be prudent for us to pass this
 
06:57:05.448 --> 06:57:05.458 align:start position:0%
on to somebody else so you'd be in favor
 
06:57:06.830 --> 06:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
of retaining this yes it would
 
06:57:09.288 --> 06:57:09.298 align:start position:0%
representative Munns
 
06:57:12.170 --> 06:57:12.180 align:start position:0%
I I think you know given the uncertainty
 
06:57:14.030 --> 06:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
I mean I I would be inclined to say
 
06:57:16.250 --> 06:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
let's retain it but the one thing that
 
06:57:18.890 --> 06:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
did concern me was what uh Mr Evans
 
06:57:20.628 --> 06:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
Brown said right at the end which is
 
06:57:23.510 --> 06:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
that there could potentially be you know
 
06:57:25.430 --> 06:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
rules put in place that say that in
 
06:57:27.350 --> 06:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
order to get this money you have to act
 
06:57:27.360 --> 06:57:28.730 align:start position:0%
order to get this money you have to act
by

06:57:28.730 --> 06:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
by
 
06:57:31.548 --> 06:57:31.558 align:start position:0%
July 1st and then we wouldn't be in a
 
06:57:33.590 --> 06:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
situation where we could do that if we
 
06:57:34.910 --> 06:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have the right legislative the
 
06:57:37.430 --> 06:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
right legislation in place
 
06:57:41.510 --> 06:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
that is correct so the procedural issue
 
06:57:44.448 --> 06:57:44.458 align:start position:0%
involved in retaining the bill is that
 
06:57:47.390 --> 06:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
if we did so we couldn't discuss it
 
06:57:50.510 --> 06:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
until the fall according to House Rules
 
06:57:53.208 --> 06:57:53.218 align:start position:0%
we could pass it in the fall and then it
 
06:57:56.570 --> 06:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
would go to the Full House in January of
 
06:57:57.770 --> 06:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
next year
 
06:58:00.530 --> 06:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
it might get passed by the house then go
 
06:58:01.910 --> 06:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
to the Senate
 
06:58:03.830 --> 06:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
no telling how long it would take the
 
06:58:05.868 --> 06:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
Senate to finish it so it's probably
 
06:58:08.270 --> 06:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
going to be next spring Before the bill
 
06:58:12.350 --> 06:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
could go into effect if we retain it
 
06:58:14.330 --> 06:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
so given that reality let me see a show
 
06:58:15.830 --> 06:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
of hands of people who would be in favor
 
06:58:15.840 --> 06:58:17.390 align:start position:0%
of hands of people who would be in favor
today

06:58:17.390 --> 06:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:58:20.930 --> 06:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
and this is non-binding but who would be
 
06:58:23.750 --> 06:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
in favor today of retaining the bill
 
06:58:27.110 --> 06:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
a question first from representative
 
06:58:29.990 --> 06:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas uh yes thank you Mr chairman
 
06:58:33.350 --> 06:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
So based on what you said then
 
06:58:33.360 --> 06:58:34.788 align:start position:0%
So based on what you said then
um

06:58:34.788 --> 06:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:37.250 --> 06:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
even if
 
06:58:40.968 --> 06:58:40.978 align:start position:0%
the house was to approve this bill it
 
06:58:43.730 --> 06:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
would still need to go before the Senate
 
06:58:47.330 --> 06:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
with their approval and then likely a
 
06:58:49.208 --> 06:58:49.218 align:start position:0%
committee of conference
 
06:58:52.730 --> 06:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
and then go before the governor for
 
06:58:55.368 --> 06:58:55.378 align:start position:0%
Signature that might not happen until
 
06:58:59.208 --> 06:58:59.218 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'm guessing May
 
06:59:01.850 --> 06:59:01.860 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the time period so that so
 
06:59:04.490 --> 06:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
even if we acted now that's the time
 
06:59:08.270 --> 06:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
that's best case it's probably May
 
06:59:10.670 --> 06:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming with everything else going
 
06:59:14.150 --> 06:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
on I just I'm I'm asking if that's a
 
06:59:18.468 --> 06:59:18.478 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation if we act now
 
06:59:20.868 --> 06:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
and pass this bill out of committee
 
06:59:22.788 --> 06:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
it'll go to the house floor
 
06:59:25.070 --> 06:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
if it passes on the house floor it'll go
 
06:59:27.468 --> 06:59:27.478 align:start position:0%
to a second committee the finance
 
06:59:30.048 --> 06:59:30.058 align:start position:0%
committee where they will then ask
 
06:59:33.230 --> 06:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
questions about it and they will either
 
06:59:35.948 --> 06:59:35.958 align:start position:0%
recommend passage or
 
06:59:38.628 --> 06:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
itl then it'll come back to the house
 
06:59:38.638 --> 06:59:40.250 align:start position:0%
itl then it'll come back to the house
floor

06:59:40.250 --> 06:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
floor
 
06:59:42.410 --> 06:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
if we pass it again then it'll go to the
 
06:59:44.810 --> 06:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
Senate so the earliest that the governor
 
06:59:46.910 --> 06:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
could probably see it would be
 
06:59:50.468 --> 06:59:50.478 align:start position:0%
sometime in May maybe June
 
06:59:53.570 --> 06:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
however if we retain the bill it'll be
 
06:59:55.968 --> 06:59:55.978 align:start position:0%
the following year in May or June before
 
06:59:58.910 --> 06:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
the governor sees it
 
07:00:00.948 --> 07:00:00.958 align:start position:0%
so given that reality let's see a show
 
07:00:02.690 --> 07:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
of hands of people who might be in favor
 
07:00:04.910 --> 07:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
of retaining the bill and this is a
 
07:00:07.670 --> 07:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
non-binding straw poll
 
07:00:11.510 --> 07:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
I guess another question yes yeah is
 
07:00:13.128 --> 07:00:13.138 align:start position:0%
there any possibility that some of the
 
07:00:14.628 --> 07:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
issues that were raised today someone
 
07:00:16.548 --> 07:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
could get back to us before Friday on
 
07:00:19.070 --> 07:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
and say you know doing further research
 
07:00:21.110 --> 07:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
on I mean especially the funding issue
 
07:00:22.070 --> 07:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
there I mean I don't know how much
 
07:00:24.170 --> 07:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
guideline is out now maybe if they
 
07:00:26.810 --> 07:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
haven't been written uh how can we vote
 
07:00:29.090 --> 07:00:29.100 align:start position:0%
on a bill for guidelines that or
 
07:00:31.670 --> 07:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
requirements that we don't know I just
 
07:00:33.230 --> 07:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
don't see how we can go forward with it
 
07:00:34.430 --> 07:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
saying well we'll just kick the ball
 
07:00:36.048 --> 07:00:36.058 align:start position:0%
over to finance and let them fix it
 
07:00:37.548 --> 07:00:37.558 align:start position:0%
later which is basically what we're
 
07:00:39.890 --> 07:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
doing uh and you know is there a
 
07:00:42.350 --> 07:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
possibility that someone has this
 
07:00:43.788 --> 07:00:43.798 align:start position:0%
information from the federal government
 
07:00:46.010 --> 07:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
that they can come back here in in a
 
07:00:47.750 --> 07:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
couple of days and answer some of these
 
07:00:50.090 --> 07:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
questions Mr Elliott
 
07:00:52.368 --> 07:00:52.378 align:start position:0%
hate to put you on the spot but do you
 
07:00:53.690 --> 07:00:53.700 align:start position:0%
think you could answer that question
 
07:00:56.448 --> 07:00:56.458 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that until the
 
07:00:58.610 --> 07:00:58.620 align:start position:0%
federal government issues guidelines on
 
07:01:00.350 --> 07:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
how to implement these programs they
 
07:01:01.810 --> 07:01:01.820 align:start position:0%
don't release the money is that true
 
07:01:04.010 --> 07:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
that is correct usually once they
 
07:01:05.990 --> 07:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
release something depending on the the
 
07:01:07.910 --> 07:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
agency it's usually it's it's guidance
 
07:01:10.490 --> 07:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
or uh administrative document basically
 
07:01:11.750 --> 07:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
laying out how you do the actual
 
07:01:13.070 --> 07:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
application then there's an application
 
07:01:15.410 --> 07:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
period that can take a couple of months
 
07:01:18.530 --> 07:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
before the the deadline I can take a
 
07:01:20.868 --> 07:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
look in the documents that exist as to
 
07:01:23.448 --> 07:01:23.458 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh entities that apply
 
07:01:24.830 --> 07:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
for these funds can use a portion of
 
07:01:28.430 --> 07:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
them to pay for staff again I would I
 
07:01:29.990 --> 07:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
would be surprised if they don't given
 
07:01:31.548 --> 07:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
that every other Federal program that
 
07:01:32.628 --> 07:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
for example that the department of
 
07:01:34.610 --> 07:01:34.620 align:start position:0%
energy runs allows for administrative
 
07:01:36.590 --> 07:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
expenses to be taken out of whatever the
 
07:01:39.650 --> 07:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
award is so I can but I can I will take
 
07:01:42.350 --> 07:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
a look and I think at the documents that
 
07:01:43.868 --> 07:01:43.878 align:start position:0%
do exist and I can have an answer before

amendment to address some of these minor
 
07:02:11.150 --> 07:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
tweaks before Friday so we could have
 
07:02:14.570 --> 07:02:14.580 align:start position:0%

07:02:17.270 --> 07:02:17.280 align:start position:0%

07:04:08.390 --> 07:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
exact session on House Bill 576 FNA
 
07:04:10.250 --> 07:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
local establishing an energy
 
07:04:12.170 --> 07:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
conservation program and an energy
 
07:04:14.390 --> 07:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
conservation project fund and
 
07:04:17.150 --> 07:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
establishing the state Pace Reserve Fund
 
07:04:20.090 --> 07:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
in discussions with representative
 
07:04:20.100 --> 07:04:21.708 align:start position:0%
in discussions with representative
McWilliams

07:04:21.708 --> 07:04:21.718 align:start position:0%
McWilliams
 
07:04:23.868 --> 07:04:23.878 align:start position:0%
it has been brought to my attention that
 
07:04:25.968 --> 07:04:25.978 align:start position:0%
there are potentially two competing
 
07:04:25.978 --> 07:04:27.968 align:start position:0%
there are potentially two competing
amendments

07:04:27.968 --> 07:04:27.978 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
07:04:31.548 --> 07:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
that what might be adopted for this bill
 
07:04:34.548 --> 07:04:34.558 align:start position:0%
apparently we can't adopt both we would
 
07:04:38.150 --> 07:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
have to adopt one or the other
 
07:04:38.160 --> 07:04:39.530 align:start position:0%
have to adopt one or the other
so

07:04:39.530 --> 07:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:04:41.270 --> 07:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask representative
 
07:04:44.570 --> 07:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
McWilliams who is intimately familiar
 
07:04:47.628 --> 07:04:47.638 align:start position:0%
with both amendments to describe the two
 
07:04:50.030 --> 07:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
amendments to us so that we can then
 
07:04:53.448 --> 07:04:53.458 align:start position:0%
decide if we want to take up one or the
 
07:04:53.458 --> 07:04:55.868 align:start position:0%
decide if we want to take up one or the
other

07:04:55.868 --> 07:04:55.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:04.490 --> 07:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:07.310 --> 07:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
I'll ask representative McWilliams to
 
07:05:10.430 --> 07:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
make a motion to
 
07:05:14.510 --> 07:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
um pass the Bill adopt the bill as OTP
 
07:05:16.490 --> 07:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair I move for the adoption of
 
07:05:19.010 --> 07:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
the bill ought to pass and offer
 
07:05:23.530 --> 07:05:23.540 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh this is the first one it's
 
07:05:27.350 --> 07:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
2023-0162h which is very similar to the
 
07:05:28.968 --> 07:05:28.978 align:start position:0%
amendment that was passed out at the
 
07:05:30.468 --> 07:05:30.478 align:start position:0%
time that the bill was heard by this
 
07:05:30.478 --> 07:05:31.850 align:start position:0%
time that the bill was heard by this
committee

07:05:31.850 --> 07:05:31.860 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:05:31.860 --> 07:05:32.750 align:start position:0%
committee
um

07:05:32.750 --> 07:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:35.690 --> 07:05:35.700 align:start position:0%
some very minor tweaks but this should
 
07:05:37.250 --> 07:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
look familiar to folks who read the
 
07:05:40.250 --> 07:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
amendment at the time of the um initial
 
07:05:42.288 --> 07:05:42.298 align:start position:0%
hearing and I'll I'll just give everyone
 
07:05:44.090 --> 07:05:44.100 align:start position:0%
a chance because we're passing this out
 
07:05:46.788 --> 07:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
and it's it's a stapled Amendment it's
 
07:05:49.430 --> 07:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
got a total of two pages
 
07:05:51.590 --> 07:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
plus an amended analysis on the third
 
07:05:51.600 --> 07:05:52.730 align:start position:0%
plus an amended analysis on the third
page

07:05:52.730 --> 07:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
page
 
07:05:55.910 --> 07:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
it looks like this and I'll ask for a
 
07:05:59.628 --> 07:05:59.638 align:start position:0%
second on the amendment on the motion
 
07:06:01.968 --> 07:06:01.978 align:start position:0%
representative munz will second the
 
07:06:01.978 --> 07:06:03.288 align:start position:0%
representative munz will second the
motion

07:06:03.288 --> 07:06:03.298 align:start position:0%
motion
 
07:06:05.208 --> 07:06:05.218 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
07:06:09.110 --> 07:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
one Amendment before us
 
07:06:14.690 --> 07:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:18.590 --> 07:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
which replaces the original bill with
 
07:06:23.208 --> 07:06:23.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:24.948 --> 07:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair can I speak to my
 
07:06:24.958 --> 07:06:26.990 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair can I speak to my
emotion

07:06:26.990 --> 07:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
emotion
 
07:06:29.750 --> 07:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
you may speak to the motion however what
 
07:06:32.330 --> 07:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
I'm confused about is that the Second
 
07:06:32.340 --> 07:06:38.510 align:start position:0%
I'm confused about is that the Second
Amendment

07:06:38.510 --> 07:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:41.570 --> 07:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass the First Amendment
 
07:06:43.368 --> 07:06:43.378 align:start position:0%
and then take up the second second
 
07:06:45.410 --> 07:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
amendment the Second Amendment would
 
07:06:47.390 --> 07:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
completely rep replace the first
 
07:06:49.610 --> 07:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
amendment is that correct that is
 
07:06:51.110 --> 07:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
correct Mr chair I think we would only
 
07:06:52.548 --> 07:06:52.558 align:start position:0%
take up the Second Amendment if the
 
07:06:54.230 --> 07:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
First Amendment failed
 
07:06:55.910 --> 07:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
so we'll take up the First Amendment
 
07:06:59.750 --> 07:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:59.760 --> 07:07:01.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:07:01.070 --> 07:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:07:03.230 --> 07:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
the floor is yours
 
07:07:05.868 --> 07:07:05.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um
 
07:07:08.990 --> 07:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
so you should all have a copy of the
 
07:07:11.810 --> 07:07:11.820 align:start position:0%
amendment number zero one six two H it's
 
07:07:14.990 --> 07:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
three pages it's stapled in the corner
 
07:07:17.208 --> 07:07:17.218 align:start position:0%
um as you probably recall from our
 
07:07:20.628 --> 07:07:20.638 align:start position:0%
presentation on the pace bill this is
 
07:07:23.570 --> 07:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
implemented in 22 States it's a private
 
07:07:26.150 --> 07:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
Funding Solution this amendment that
 
07:07:29.150 --> 07:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
we're looking at here changes the name
 
07:07:32.810 --> 07:07:32.820 align:start position:0%
of the program on line 11 of the first
 
07:07:32.820 --> 07:07:34.310 align:start position:0%
of the program on line 11 of the first
page

07:07:34.310 --> 07:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
page
 
07:07:37.910 --> 07:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
it is c hyphen Pace to make it super
 
07:07:40.730 --> 07:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
clear that this is a commercial Pace
 
07:07:43.670 --> 07:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment and it does not impact
 
07:07:45.890 --> 07:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
Municipal pace which is already on
 
07:07:48.230 --> 07:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
Statute in the state of New Hampshire
 
07:07:51.110 --> 07:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
the intent here is that
 
07:07:51.120 --> 07:07:51.948 align:start position:0%
the intent here is that
um

07:07:51.948 --> 07:07:51.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:07:54.230 --> 07:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
borrowers who choose to use commercial
 
07:07:57.590 --> 07:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
Pace funding can access a 30 federal tax
 
07:07:57.600 --> 07:07:58.570 align:start position:0%
Pace funding can access a 30 federal tax
credit

07:07:58.570 --> 07:07:58.580 align:start position:0%
credit
 
07:08:01.190 --> 07:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
with the infrastructure reduction act
 
07:08:03.708 --> 07:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
they could get up to a 50 or 60 percent
 
07:08:06.350 --> 07:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
tax credit so for a large developer
 
07:08:08.990 --> 07:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
doing something like large housing in
 
07:08:11.390 --> 07:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire either say a mill building
 
07:08:14.570 --> 07:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
conversion or new Greenfield ground up
 
07:08:17.270 --> 07:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
construction of a new housing complex
 
07:08:20.150 --> 07:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
this is an excellent way to access the
 
07:08:22.430 --> 07:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
funds we did talk about the funding
 
07:08:24.890 --> 07:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
mechanism being a lien against the
 
07:08:27.830 --> 07:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
property and being collected the same
 
07:08:29.570 --> 07:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
way that the property taxes are
 
07:08:31.788 --> 07:08:31.798 align:start position:0%
collected through the municipality that
 
07:08:33.650 --> 07:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
hasn't changed we're simply clarifying
 
07:08:36.170 --> 07:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
that this is commercial Pace five units
 
07:08:38.628 --> 07:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
plus commercial building it's very
 
07:08:42.590 --> 07:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
similar to a tiff or an oz District
 
07:08:44.270 --> 07:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
um sort of like revitalization and
 
07:08:46.250 --> 07:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
historic credits all of these programs
 
07:08:48.490 --> 07:08:48.500 align:start position:0%
are intended to apply
 
07:08:51.530 --> 07:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
for a developer who would like to access
 
07:08:54.170 --> 07:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
5 funds but needs to pay them back even
 
07:08:57.708 --> 07:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
if they sell the project so the lien
 
07:09:00.530 --> 07:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
runs with the property
 
07:09:00.540 --> 07:09:02.150 align:start position:0%
runs with the property
um

07:09:02.150 --> 07:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:04.070 --> 07:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
also there are some strings attached to
 
07:09:06.170 --> 07:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
the underlying cpace fund I just want to
 
07:09:07.510 --> 07:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
be super clear
 
07:09:10.250 --> 07:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
if you're doing this project you do have
 
07:09:12.110 --> 07:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
to improve up to 40 percent of the
 
07:09:14.930 --> 07:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
building efficiency for a renovation
 
07:09:17.330 --> 07:09:17.340 align:start position:0%
project and for new construction there's
 
07:09:19.730 --> 07:09:19.740 align:start position:0%
a baseline that you need to increase by
 
07:09:22.190 --> 07:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
40 efficiency in order to access the
 
07:09:25.070 --> 07:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
funds so the change between this
 
07:09:26.570 --> 07:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
amendment that you're seeing here and
 
07:09:27.890 --> 07:09:27.900 align:start position:0%
the amendment that you saw when the bill
 
07:09:31.070 --> 07:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
was initially presented is that on the
 
07:09:32.930 --> 07:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
very last page of the amendment we're
 
07:09:34.910 --> 07:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
looking at page two
 
07:09:38.690 --> 07:09:38.700 align:start position:0%
lines 12 and 13.
 
07:09:41.208 --> 07:09:41.218 align:start position:0%
it says that um
 
07:09:44.448 --> 07:09:44.458 align:start position:0%
the lien is going to have the same lean
 
07:09:47.090 --> 07:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
priority and status as other property
 
07:09:49.548 --> 07:09:49.558 align:start position:0%
tax and special assessment liens as
 
07:09:51.708 --> 07:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
provided in RSA 80 which is the enabling
 
07:09:53.868 --> 07:09:53.878 align:start position:0%
statute so what we're doing here is
 
07:09:55.250 --> 07:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
making this a more interesting
 
07:09:58.310 --> 07:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
investment of the vehicle more appealing
 
07:10:00.110 --> 07:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
to someone who wants to do private
 
07:10:02.868 --> 07:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
Equity loans by making it have the same
 
07:10:05.690 --> 07:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
lean priority meaning that if a property
 
07:10:09.288 --> 07:10:09.298 align:start position:0%
is going bankrupt and the town ends up
 
07:10:12.048 --> 07:10:12.058 align:start position:0%
taking ownership or a separate mortgage
 
07:10:14.330 --> 07:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
takes ownership at the same time that
 
07:10:16.010 --> 07:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
the property taxes need to be paid off
 
07:10:18.890 --> 07:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
to the municipality this loan also needs
 
07:10:20.570 --> 07:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
to be paid off in order for the property
 
07:10:22.910 --> 07:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
to change hands so it creates a more
 
07:10:25.730 --> 07:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
enticing investment so a lot of the
 
07:10:27.590 --> 07:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
concerns that we heard during testimony
 
07:10:29.270 --> 07:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
have been stricken completely from the
 
07:10:32.510 --> 07:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
bill this is really meant to be enabling
 
07:10:35.090 --> 07:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
so that we can do commercial Pace in New
 
07:10:36.948 --> 07:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that private Equity Funds
 
07:10:39.530 --> 07:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
can come here and do loans to developers
 
07:10:42.410 --> 07:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
and gosh fingers crossed we can get some
 
07:10:44.448 --> 07:10:44.458 align:start position:0%
more housing in New Hampshire I'm happy
 
07:10:47.690 --> 07:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:49.730 --> 07:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions about this
 
07:10:52.090 --> 07:10:52.100 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Wendy Thomas
 
07:10:54.288 --> 07:10:54.298 align:start position:0%

you mentioned the number of states that
 
07:10:59.750 --> 07:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
already have a program like this can you
 
07:11:01.190 --> 07:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
can you just give me that number again
 
07:11:03.708 --> 07:11:03.718 align:start position:0%
please there are 22 states with enabling
 
07:11:06.230 --> 07:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
c-pace legislation on the boards thank
 
07:11:06.240 --> 07:11:07.490 align:start position:0%
c-pace legislation on the boards thank
you

07:11:07.490 --> 07:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:11:09.410 --> 07:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
07:11:11.150 --> 07:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
07:11:14.208 --> 07:11:14.218 align:start position:0%
representative just to clarify the the
 
07:11:16.310 --> 07:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
bill as we first saw it was more than
 
07:11:18.048 --> 07:11:18.058 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation it also has some
 
07:11:19.788 --> 07:11:19.798 align:start position:0%
Provisions for setting up the financing
 
07:11:21.770 --> 07:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
mechanism and this bill does not have
 
07:11:23.510 --> 07:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
that just as an enabling legislation
 
07:11:25.730 --> 07:11:25.740 align:start position:0%
pieces am I correct in saying that you
 
07:11:27.890 --> 07:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
are correct all of that Administration
 
07:11:29.990 --> 07:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
has been completely removed this is only
 
07:11:31.968 --> 07:11:31.978 align:start position:0%
enabling it's up to private Equity to
 
07:11:33.948 --> 07:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
decide how to actually do the financing
 
07:11:37.548 --> 07:11:37.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:39.590 --> 07:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
07:11:43.968 --> 07:11:43.978 align:start position:0%
it's so clear the existing 576 is gone
 
07:11:48.788 --> 07:11:48.798 align:start position:0%
that is being replaced entirely by uh
 
07:11:51.410 --> 07:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
230162h yes representative everything
 
07:11:53.390 --> 07:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
else is disappeared in the trash all
 
07:12:00.590 --> 07:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:04.310 --> 07:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
seeing no additional questions is there
 
07:12:09.410 --> 07:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:11.930 --> 07:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
07:12:14.390 --> 07:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just my discussion
 
07:12:16.430 --> 07:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
just look at the amendment the hardest
 
07:12:19.310 --> 07:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
part I have with this is that basically
 
07:12:22.548 --> 07:12:22.558 align:start position:0%
the entire Edition on page two
 
07:12:24.468 --> 07:12:24.478 align:start position:0%
and forgive me I know where science
 
07:12:27.048 --> 07:12:27.058 align:start position:0%
technology energy but just reading it
 
07:12:28.850 --> 07:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
everything in the every single one of
 
07:12:32.090 --> 07:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
these lines except for line six has to
 
07:12:34.190 --> 07:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
do with Municipal and county in my
 
07:12:37.010 --> 07:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
opinion it has to do with penalties
 
07:12:41.030 --> 07:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
property taxes town city districts it
 
07:12:43.250 --> 07:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
has the only thing that has anything to
 
07:12:45.770 --> 07:12:45.780 align:start position:0%
do at all with science and technology is
 
07:12:47.810 --> 07:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
line six where it's Energy Efficiency
 
07:12:49.788 --> 07:12:49.798 align:start position:0%
and clean energy District everything
 
07:12:51.948 --> 07:12:51.958 align:start position:0%
else what I can see has to do with
 
07:12:55.070 --> 07:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County committee so I
 
07:12:57.350 --> 07:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
don't even know I don't believe it's in
 
07:12:59.690 --> 07:12:59.700 align:start position:0%
the right even the right committee this
 
07:13:01.490 --> 07:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
is my opinion thanks
 
07:13:04.190 --> 07:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
just as a point of information because
 
07:13:08.270 --> 07:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
of the letters appended to the end of
 
07:13:10.810 --> 07:13:10.820 align:start position:0%
the bill number
 
07:13:13.490 --> 07:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
fn-a-local it will be going
 
07:13:16.070 --> 07:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
to the finance committee potentially to
 
07:13:18.110 --> 07:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
the Ways and Means Committee potentially
 
07:13:19.610 --> 07:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
and to the municipal and County
 
07:13:22.850 --> 07:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
government committee potentially
 
07:13:25.330 --> 07:13:25.340 align:start position:0%
it'll be up to the speaker to decide
 
07:13:28.430 --> 07:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
what committees that it actually goes to
 
07:13:28.440 --> 07:13:30.110 align:start position:0%
what committees that it actually goes to
so

07:13:30.110 --> 07:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:13:33.410 --> 07:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
before we take a vote on this uh
 
07:13:37.010 --> 07:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
