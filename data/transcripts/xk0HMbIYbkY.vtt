00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
Eric Gallagher of Concord welcome
 
00:03:32.700 --> 00:04:00.589 align:start position:0%
Eric Gallagher of Concord welcome
representative

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 align:start position:0%
so hello uh for the record I am
 
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
representative Eric Gallagher uh from
 
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
Concord Ward six that's Merrimack County
 
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
District 20 and I am here to introduce
 
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
556 relative to the duties of the
 
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
information Technology Council
 
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.550 align:start position:0%
information Technology Council
so

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is was part of
 
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
um one of the bills
 
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
I filed last year
 
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.610 align:start position:0%
I filed last year
um

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 align:start position:0%
so last year I filed
 
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1273 which I also referred to
 
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
as my software act which was an acronym
 
00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
for securing our freedom to write and
 
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
read everything
 
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.469 align:start position:0%
read everything
so

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 align:start position:0%
yeah this bill is
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
based on feedback I got from that bill
 
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.030 align:start position:0%
based on feedback I got from that bill
so

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.050 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
yeah basically the idea of it is to
 
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
promote software freedom in the state of
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that is
 
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
being able to do with your computers As
 
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
You Wish rather than having
 
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.650 align:start position:0%
You Wish rather than having
um

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
big tech companies
 
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
control you
 
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.790 align:start position:0%
control you
um

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.050 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
the feedback part one of the items of
 
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
feedback was that I was trying to do too
 
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
much in a single bill
 
00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
um this it went before Edna by the way
 
00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 align:start position:0%
so this is their feedback so yeah I
 
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
split it up this was the part of the
 
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
bill that was the study committee
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
portion of it basically just studying
 
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
how we can
 
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.550 align:start position:0%
how we can
um

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
make greater use of free software as
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
free us and freedom here in the state
 
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.330 align:start position:0%
free us and freedom here in the state
um

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
another part of the feedback was all
 
00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
right why is this coming before eena
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
instead of Science and Technology and I
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
mean I I don't really know how Bill's
 
00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 align:start position:0%
got assigned but
 
00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:07.550 align:start position:0%
got assigned but
um

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
this year by breaking it into multiple
 
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
pieces I did manage to get at least this
 
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
one before this committee so
 
00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 align:start position:0%
um hopefully that's an improvement
 
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
um and then another one was why are you
 
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
creating a new study committee when we
 
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
already have this information Technology
 
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.890 align:start position:0%
already have this information Technology
Council

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
Council
 
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I
 
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
took basically the duties of
 
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
the previous bills
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
study committee and um just assigned
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
them to the existing information
 
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.330 align:start position:0%
them to the existing information
technology

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 align:start position:0%
uh Council instead
 
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.790 align:start position:0%
uh Council instead
so

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
um to
 
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
go over the
 
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.070 align:start position:0%
go over the
um

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
so to go over the uh
 
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
bullet points um
 
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.490 align:start position:0%
bullet points um
so

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
replacing proprietary software used by
 
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
CA agencies proprietary software is
 
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.309 align:start position:0%
CA agencies proprietary software is
basically

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:12.419 align:start position:0%
the opposite of free and open source
 
00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:13.969 align:start position:0%
the opposite of free and open source
software

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
software
 
00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:14.689 align:start position:0%
software
um

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
it basically
 
00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 align:start position:0%
gives tech companies leverage over us
 
00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:22.430 align:start position:0%
gives tech companies leverage over us
um

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.110 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh there there is bipartisan anger at
 
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.860 align:start position:0%
big Tech from the right for
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
things like censorship and from the left
 
00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:37.979 align:start position:0%
for just being big in general
 
00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:39.409 align:start position:0%
for just being big in general
um

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:39.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think
 
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:45.060 align:start position:0%
that if we
 
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
can figure out a way
 
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
to reduce or
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
remove entirely our use of proprietary
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
software we can
 
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.809 align:start position:0%
software we can
um

00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:59.570 --> 00:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
gain some power back from the big Temp
 
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
Tech companies
 
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:01.969 align:start position:0%
Tech companies
um

00:08:01.969 --> 00:08:01.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
so then also there's a point about
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence in there that's
 
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
something that's becoming a Hot Topic
 
00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:11.699 align:start position:0%
that I think as a state we need to start
 
00:08:13.969 --> 00:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
00:08:13.979 --> 00:08:15.409 align:start position:0%
thinking about
um

00:08:15.409 --> 00:08:15.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
so copy left licensees that's a specific
 
00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
type of free and open source software
 
00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:23.330 align:start position:0%
type of free and open source software
um

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
bit which basically
 
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:29.780 align:start position:0%
it's form of copyright but instead of
 
00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:33.539 align:start position:0%
granting exclusive rights
 
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
um like proprietary software does it
 
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.969 align:start position:0%
um like proprietary software does it
requires

00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
requires
 
00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:39.649 align:start position:0%
requires
uh

00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:39.659 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
people that use and redistribute
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
copyleft software to preserve those same
 
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.290 align:start position:0%
copyleft software to preserve those same
freedoms

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:47.300 align:start position:0%
freedoms
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
to in any further redistributions
 
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.030 align:start position:0%
to in any further redistributions
um

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
so State's ability to
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
develop and release open source software
 
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
that means writing software itself as
 
00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:04.019 align:start position:0%
opposed to the previous one where it's
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
about using other people's free and open
 
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
source software
 
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.350 align:start position:0%
source software
um

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
consider how to develop a program and
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism for providing legal
 
00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:15.959 align:start position:0%
assistance to developers of free
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
software that that has to do with one of
 
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.370 align:start position:0%
software that that has to do with one of
the

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:21.380 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
one complaint I hear from free software
 
00:09:26.449 --> 00:09:26.459 align:start position:0%
developers a lot as to
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh why they don't use copyleft licenses
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
as well oh it's gonna be too much of an
 
00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
effort for me to defend it in court
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
um so I think
 
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
um having making it easier
 
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
for free software developers to do that
 
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
would help encourage the development of
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
more of it
 
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.389 align:start position:0%
more of it
um

00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:54.730 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:54.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
review and develop recommendations for
 
00:09:59.570 --> 00:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
the expansion of the Statewide
 
00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:02.339 align:start position:0%
information policy on open government
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
data standards so
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's basically just like what file
 
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:09.740 align:start position:0%
formats things are in
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
attack enact adopt and Implement when
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
feasible and policy to ensure the right
 
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
to data portability so that's one of the
 
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
things Europe's gdpr
 
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:25.820 align:start position:0%
um address the p in this reportability
 
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.370 align:start position:0%
um address the p in this reportability
basically

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:27.380 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
take your Computing data from one
 
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
service to another rather than having
 
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
the company that runs the service
 
00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
control whether you can do that or not
 
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
so um that one that's what that one's
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
about so this is all um
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
this is all advisory
 
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.530 align:start position:0%
this is all advisory
um the

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.790 align:start position:0%
um the
the uh

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
advice is
 
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
can certainly be ignored if the
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
information technology ends up giving
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
bad advice
 
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I think
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
that makes it a pretty good substitute
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
for a study committee and I'll take any
 
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
thank you before I call on
 
00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:25.019 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas to ask a question
 
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
I need to ask a question myself
 
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
and that is when you use the word free
 
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
in this legislation you mean free to
 
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.690 align:start position:0%
in this legislation you mean free to
inspect

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
inspect
 
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.030 align:start position:0%
inspect
uh

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
and transparent but you don't
 
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean free of cost is that
 
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
correct uh yes correct um in the free
 
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
software World sometimes that's referred
 
00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:50.579 align:start position:0%
to as the Libre versus Gratis
 
00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:52.550 align:start position:0%
to as the Libre versus Gratis
distinction

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
um just due to other languages have that
 
00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
distinction where Libre means free Us in
 
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.410 align:start position:0%
distinction where Libre means free Us in
Freedom

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
Freedom
 
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
um and then Gratis means free asking
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
costs sometimes you have software that
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
is both Libre and Gratis but it doesn't
 
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be the case there
 
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
are actually some companies that sell
 
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
Libre software like red hat for instance
 
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:17.750 align:start position:0%
Libre software like red hat for instance
um

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:20.459 align:start position:0%
and meanwhile there's also lots of
 
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
Gratis software that is not Libre so
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean um
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
I mean primarily uh Libre software
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's Doug Thomas that is thank you
 
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.650 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
comment first uh it's interesting that
 
00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:44.339 align:start position:0%
this came to us I was going to recommend
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
that it go to Commerce for our review
 
00:12:50.449 --> 00:12:50.459 align:start position:0%
but that's the one committee we have it
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
here that's the one committee that I
 
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
haven't got well actually they got right
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
to repair which wasn't originally part
 
00:12:59.930 --> 00:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
of this bill but is kind of related but
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
they're the one committee that yeah the
 
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
um last year's bill got broken up so it
 
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
went to e-dna Judiciary criminal justice
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
and this committee but not Commerce
 
00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:16.139 align:start position:0%
though so so my my question is since we
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
already have an Information Technology
 
00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
Council I I don't see why explain to me
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
why these items could not have just been
 
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
presented to the council in a matter of
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
an agenda item instead of having a whole
 
00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
new bill and repurposing the uh the uh
 
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
the it Council why why couldn't these
 
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
things be discussed in the Council just
 
00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
as a part of a normal agenda item I mean
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
I guess theoretically they could be but
 
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
if you look at the RSA being amended
 
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
here it has a bunch of other items on
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
there already that could also just be
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
agenda items
 
00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:00.899 align:start position:0%
um about strategic technology plans uh
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
computer systems consolidation uh so I
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
think basically this is just meant to
 
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
fit in with the existing items and
 
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.069 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:20.449 align:start position:0%
follow-up
uh

00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:20.459 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
do with these if these things were added
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
would there be would there be need for
 
00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
additional people to be placed on the
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
council for expanded knowledge purposes
 
00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:35.030 align:start position:0%
council for expanded knowledge purposes
um

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.750 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
the legislation does not specify a
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
number of or well at least the RSA being
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
amended here does not specify the number
 
00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:50.519 align:start position:0%
of members so
 
00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:51.170 align:start position:0%
of members so
um

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
I mean yeah I'm not touching that so I
 
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
would assume that it would continue to
 
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:08.220 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher for taking my
 
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.490 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher for taking my
question

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:09.500 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
can you provide us some examples of some
 
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
of the state systems that would be
 
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
appropriate to transition from
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
proprietary to free or open source
 
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.310 align:start position:0%
proprietary to free or open source
um

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.829 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
yeah uh
 
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
I mean I think like
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
using Libra office instead of Microsoft
 
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
Office for example would be one um
 
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
for uh GIS
 
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
um I know like my dad makes maps for the
 
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:41.750 align:start position:0%
um I know like my dad makes maps for the
state

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.050 align:start position:0%
um and
um

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:44.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
apparently uh the planning office pays
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
out a lot of money to
 
00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.250 align:start position:0%
out a lot of money to
um

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
esri every year when
 
00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
um previously it did actually use grass
 
00:15:59.930 --> 00:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
GIS which is a
 
00:16:02.769 --> 00:16:02.779 align:start position:0%
free alternative to it
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
which I think could be returned to
 
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.069 align:start position:0%
which I think could be returned to
um

00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh some of my other bills focused more
 
00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
on user facing ones such as
 
00:16:12.899 --> 00:16:15.050 align:start position:0%
on user facing ones such as
um

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
such as like the websites or things that
 
00:16:20.569 --> 00:16:20.579 align:start position:0%
people enter inter citizens interact
 
00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:21.290 align:start position:0%
people enter inter citizens interact
with

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.069 align:start position:0%
with
um

00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
for like paying taxes or filing for
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
assistance programs with uh
 
00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:31.090 align:start position:0%
assistance programs with uh
with

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:31.100 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
DHHS for example
 
00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.610 align:start position:0%
DHHS for example
um

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
and there there have been stories
 
00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:38.509 align:start position:0%
and there there have been stories
um

00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
one of our local
 
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
town or town libraries actually
 
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
transitioned their entire Library
 
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
software to be free and open source um
 
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.249 align:start position:0%
software to be free and open source um
and

00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:52.259 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:55.139 align:start position:0%
so I mean we have a state Library so I
 
00:16:56.569 --> 00:16:56.579 align:start position:0%
think they could
 
00:16:58.249 --> 00:16:58.259 align:start position:0%
take some
 
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
inspiration from
 
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:02.220 align:start position:0%
the town that did that I can't remember
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
which one it was off the top of my head
 
00:17:04.679 --> 00:17:05.329 align:start position:0%
which one it was off the top of my head
um

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
but yeah there's a lot of examples and
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
there are in fact a lot of places where
 
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
um the state does already use free and
 
00:17:15.289 --> 00:17:15.299 align:start position:0%
open source software like at one of the
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
previous hearings
 
00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:17.750 align:start position:0%
previous hearings
um

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:20.929 --> 00:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
that commissioner was telling about how
 
00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
a lot of the websites run on Drupal so
 
00:17:23.699 --> 00:17:25.490 align:start position:0%
a lot of the websites run on Drupal so
that

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
is something that's good that I think
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
could be done more of um
 
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
representative berezny how to build that
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
I co-sponsored last term
 
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
that was also kind of along these lines
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think this bill
 
00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:46.549 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think this bill
could

00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
um help identify some additional ways to
 
00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:54.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
00:18:00.529 --> 00:18:00.539 align:start position:0%
representative for being here
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
um this is um very interesting ideas in
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
this bill and I believe you're the first
 
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
one to bring up the ethics of our
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence so that's kind
 
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
of interesting
 
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
um my concern in this sort of piggybacks
 
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
on what representative Doug Thomas said
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
was do you believe the counts you're
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
requiring some pretty intense new
 
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
studies to be added to this report and I
 
00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:27.299 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's a yearly report or
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
not but do you believe the council has
 
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
the skills and the resources to add on
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
all of these more complex studies
 
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.490 align:start position:0%
all of these more complex studies
um

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
I think yeah fear well so my original
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
idea was to make
 
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
a new study committee
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
because Edna was wondering why make a
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
new study committee when the information
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
Technology Council already exists if it
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
turns out that we do actually need an
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
entirely new study committee event yeah
 
00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
I'd be fine with switching back to that
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
with making it a separate committee
 
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
after all I was just
 
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
um pending list to the information
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
Technology Council specifically based on
 
00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:12.419 align:start position:0%
feedback from Edna last term
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
taking my question now myself being a
 
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
former paid hacker I have to ask you a
 
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
question about open source
 
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.210 align:start position:0%
question about open source
um

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
knowing that uh in open source and
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
freeware it's pretty common that we used
 
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
to back in the days of bash open BSD and
 
00:19:36.169 --> 00:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
that we used to live in that world and
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
we'd be able to would this not make it
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
easier for folks to be able to
 
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
manipulate the kernel change the change
 
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
the clock speed and be able to
 
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
manipulate software that's open to
 
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.930 align:start position:0%
manipulate software that's open to
everybody

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:48.650 align:start position:0%
everybody
um

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.630 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
well it it depends on the people you're
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
talking about specifically
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
yes it would make it easier
 
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.549 align:start position:0%
yes it would make it easier
for

00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:01.559 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
people in the state government who we
 
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
want to actually be doing that but free
 
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
software it does come with access
 
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
controls and security features
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
um you know being open source lets it be
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
inspected by
 
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
a large number of people to
 
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.710 align:start position:0%
a large number of people to
um

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
so that means that it uh vulnerabilities
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
are disclosed more quickly
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
um in
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
previous hearings for example the log
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
for J vulnerability was brought up which
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
was kind of portrayed as a failing of
 
00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:45.539 align:start position:0%
Open Source but I actually see that as a
 
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
successive open source since the
 
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
vulnerability was actually disclosed
 
00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
rather than just going undisclosed for a
 
00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
long period of time where nobody knows
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
if it's being exploited or not whereas
 
00:20:58.970 --> 00:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
this actually let it get fixed a lot
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
uh yeah just a random person who knows
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
that was able to fix it
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
um so and yeah I'd also remind people of
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
the distinction between code and data
 
00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.549 align:start position:0%
the distinction between code and data
um

00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:18.350 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.150 align:start position:0%
so
yeah

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
software that is open source can be used
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
with data that is private there there is
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
a distinction there
 
00:21:33.529 --> 00:21:33.539 align:start position:0%
um and yeah you see
 
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
you know there's examples like the gnu
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
privacy guard
 
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
for example is and
 
00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:40.970 align:start position:0%
for example is and
um

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
a piece of software that can help
 
00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:44.900 align:start position:0%
protect your privacy
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
data privacy so
 
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
um but yeah that is something
 
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
representative Christian has a question
 
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:03.529 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:03.539 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
um also wanted to say thank you for
 
00:22:06.289 --> 00:22:06.299 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill it's nice to actually
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
deal with some technology on the sdne
 
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.130 align:start position:0%
deal with some technology on the sdne
committee

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
um I was just wondering getting to the
 
00:22:15.169 --> 00:22:15.179 align:start position:0%
ethics of artificial intelligence usage
 
00:22:15.179 --> 00:22:16.010 align:start position:0%
ethics of artificial intelligence usage
um

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
can you give some examples of places
 
00:22:21.169 --> 00:22:21.179 align:start position:0%
where State agencies maybe are looking
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
at using AI or are already using AI do
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
you know if anyone's using like chat GPT
 
00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
to create things Etc
 
00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.450 align:start position:0%
to create things Etc
um

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
so no I don't know
 
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
if they are currently but there are lots
 
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
of applications where
 
00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.029 align:start position:0%
of applications where
um

00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
where they could be
 
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
um yeah like chat GPT I used that to
 
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.409 align:start position:0%
um yeah like chat GPT I used that to
um

00:22:45.409 --> 00:22:45.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
help prepare for
 
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
uh some of my I I asked it about some of
 
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
my own bills that I was introducing to
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
see uh what it thought of them not not
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
this one specifically but other ones um
 
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
yeah um stuff like stable diffusion or
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
dolly for artwork Generation
 
00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
Um you know for
 
00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
if if we need to modify our logo or
 
00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.610 align:start position:0%
if if we need to modify our logo or
provide

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
graphics for like there's a State Office
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
of graphics and printing that I walk by
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
pretty often on my walk to the lob here
 
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.310 align:start position:0%
pretty often on my walk to the lob here
um

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:27.539 align:start position:0%
so yeah like whether or not it would be
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
were there allowed to use that
 
00:23:32.289 --> 00:23:32.299 align:start position:0%
um then also you get to stuff like
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
facial recognition
 
00:23:36.169 --> 00:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
um in the
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice field whether that
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
should be allowed
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
um that's a form of AI and then also AIA
 
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
based uh gunshot detections and you see
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
some police departments
 
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
I'm starting to use robots
 
00:23:58.850 --> 00:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
uh for law enforcement
 
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
so there's a question there as to like
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
what sort of autonomy do we want to
 
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
Grant police robots that I think is
 
00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.149 align:start position:0%
Grant police robots that I think is
worth

00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
worth
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions I want to
 
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for introducing
 
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
this proposed legislation
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
and I'd like now to call on Mr Dennis
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
Goulet who is the commissioner of the
 
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology Mr
 
00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:35.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.049 --> 00:24:39.059 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Dennis Goulet has
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
stated I am the commissioner for the
 
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology as
 
00:24:48.169 --> 00:24:48.179 align:start position:0%
such I'm responsible for
 
00:24:48.179 --> 00:24:48.770 align:start position:0%
such I'm responsible for
um

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
operating the I.T function for the
 
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
executive branch in New Hampshire and I
 
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
am a member on the I.T Council
 
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
the uh a small correction uh the the I.T
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
Council membership is actually
 
00:25:09.649 --> 00:25:09.659 align:start position:0%
documented in statute 21r and um so we
 
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
we do change it from time to time but
 
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
I've been here almost eight years now
 
00:25:15.049 --> 00:25:15.059 align:start position:0%
it's been pretty stable
 
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
um and it is a mixture of agency folks
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
as well as outside influencers from
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
Education City Government town
 
00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
government County Government
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh we we operate in an attempt to guide
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
the I.T I call it the board of directors
 
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
for my department and we like to have an
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
idea that we're fully transparent and
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
that we actually operate under best
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
practice for the i t function
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
for the executive branch we also
 
00:25:51.169 --> 00:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
collaborate closely with the other
 
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
branches of government so you'll see a
 
00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
lot of times we're actually doing the
 
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
same things
 
00:25:59.450 --> 00:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
I'm testifying in opposition to this
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
bill this morning for three primary
 
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
reasons uh one is that actually the
 
00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.070 align:start position:0%
reasons uh one is that actually the
subparts

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
subparts
 
00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:07.730 align:start position:0%
subparts
um

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
I A9 i810 and I F really are already
 
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
covered under language in in the
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
information Technology Council and we
 
00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
can all already execute on things like
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
that in fact we do consider
 
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
um I'll just give you an example a
 
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher brought it up
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
when we were talking some years ago
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
about our new web what our new website
 
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
platform should be for for the state
 
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
um we were looking at all kinds of
 
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
options and we ended up
 
00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:36.299 align:start position:0%
um in in deliberation with the
 
00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:37.980 align:start position:0%
information Technology Council settling
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
on an open source a managed open source
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
platform that we now use and are
 
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
operating uh most of our executive
 
00:26:48.529 --> 00:26:48.539 align:start position:0%
branch websites on as well as the
 
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
judicial branch website and the
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State super cost effective
 
00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
works really well for us so you know we
 
00:26:57.769 --> 00:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
do already consider open source and
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
we're running it in various other places
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
in fact the most recent thing is is for
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
our small agencies we have they have a
 
00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
real challenge with costs right they
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of money A lot of times
 
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
they're General funded so we're trying
 
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
to make sure we're spending the least
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
amount of money for them and and we're
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
going to do a pilot on on an open source
 
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
case management platform to see if that
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
would be a good fit for the small
 
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.850 align:start position:0%
would be a good fit for the small
agencies

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
uh the second reason why why uh area of
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
concern is the council is really not uh
 
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
currently empowered or provisioned to
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
take on some of these new duties as
 
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
defined in subparts uh IB through e and
 
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.490 align:start position:0%
defined in subparts uh IB through e and
IG

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
IG
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
um it this would really reinvent our
 
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
focus and shift us outside of our you
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
know best practice for the executive
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
branch IET function
 
00:27:57.169 --> 00:27:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
proposed subparts i c i d and I E
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
um really appear to take and direct the
 
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
council to a specific policy position
 
00:28:09.409 --> 00:28:09.419 align:start position:0%
which I believe is outside of our peer
 
00:28:12.049 --> 00:28:12.059 align:start position:0%
review and may actually not um
 
00:28:15.169 --> 00:28:15.179 align:start position:0%
not be uh guide us towards Beck's
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
practice in each case
 
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
so best practice evolves over time
 
00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:24.179 align:start position:0%
putting detailed I.T policy positions in
 
00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
statute that then myself and my
 
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
successors have to follow I don't think
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
is in the best interest of the executive
 
00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
branch or even the state as a whole
 
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
a couple other questions came up or at
 
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
least one other and that was
 
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:38.690 align:start position:0%
least one other and that was
um

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:42.169 --> 00:28:42.179 align:start position:0%
the the uh are there examples where it
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
might be good to run an open source
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
software for the state and I think I
 
00:28:48.529 --> 00:28:48.539 align:start position:0%
touched on that a little bit but um you
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
know we we do have
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
um you know we are running
 
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
um our primary server operating system
 
00:28:57.649 --> 00:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
is Linux we run a managed Linux so that
 
00:29:00.169 --> 00:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
we're watching out for um making sure
 
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
we're fully patched at all times we have
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
over a thousand Linux servers running
 
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:05.220 align:start position:0%
applications just for the executive
 
00:29:09.049 --> 00:29:09.059 align:start position:0%
branch and you know just the the
 
00:29:12.169 --> 00:29:12.179 align:start position:0%
the effort of making sure we're patching
 
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:13.860 align:start position:0%
them for security and privacy of
 
00:29:15.769 --> 00:29:15.779 align:start position:0%
information is is a large effort but it
 
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
does run really well for us so I again
 
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
I would uh again example of how we are
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
using open source and we are considering
 
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
it when uh when appropriate the log 4J
 
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
came up I thought
 
00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:33.539 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the question related to
 
00:29:36.169 --> 00:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
security I think that any you know open
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
source or proprietary software can be
 
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
managed in a secure way or in an
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
insecure way I don't know that either
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
one of those platforms is particularly
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
less secure than the other it's all
 
00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:49.980 align:start position:0%
about how you manage the code base and
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
manage the installed base the log4j
 
00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
example the some incorrect information
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
was shared
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
and that is that that vulnerability was
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
out there for a long time years and
 
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
years and years and and it's taking us
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
actually years to remediate it because
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
it managed to get its that that Library
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
managed to get into lots of platforms
 
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
both both open source and proprietary
 
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
platforms so to the to this day I'm
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
still you know years after that popped
 
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
I'm Still Still managing it
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
the final thing is before I take as many
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
questions as you have is around
 
00:30:30.169 --> 00:30:30.179 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence it is rearing
 
00:30:33.169 --> 00:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
its head now and I think that you know
 
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
I'd like to to contrast between what I
 
00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
think the I.T council's duty is as it
 
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
relates to artificial intelligence and
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
and general public policy Duty so is
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence a good way to
 
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
run I.T in New Hampshire from an I.T
 
00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
perspective that is absolutely the I.T
 
00:30:54.409 --> 00:30:54.419 align:start position:0%
council's responsibility I think we
 
00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
should look at it and say what we're
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
doing and say whether we think it's a
 
00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
good thing or not then there's is uh is
 
00:31:06.169 --> 00:31:06.179 align:start position:0%
AI or robotic process automation a good
 
00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
thing for the state the citizens of the
 
00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
state the citizens of our country that
 
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
is not the purview of the information
 
00:31:15.049 --> 00:31:15.059 align:start position:0%
Technology Council that's a larger
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
public policy issue that should be taken
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
up elsewhere
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
we do have some examples we're
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
considering now and we're considering a
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
remote process automation pilot soon
 
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
um why are we doing that we're having a
 
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
hard time hiring people and there's
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
certain types of jobs that it's really
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
good for is that is that the right thing
 
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
to do I'm not I'm not making that
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
distinction I'm I'm saying we may have
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
areas where we can mitigate the fact
 
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
that we can't hire people using RPI that
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
concludes my formal testimony and I have
 
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions excellent thank you
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
for that testimony representative Doug
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you Mr
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
question and um
 
00:31:59.450 --> 00:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you here again you
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
don't come here very often so it's good
 
00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
to see you now once in a while
 
00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
this poses a kind of a good question
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
here if there's a distinction between
 
00:32:15.169 --> 00:32:15.179 align:start position:0%
the information Technology Council and
 
00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
the information technology department
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
my question would be on what you see in
 
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
the spill which all seem to be good
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
ideas of things that should be
 
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
considered who if if not you or the
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
council who who do you believe should be
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
looking at these things at at the state
 
00:32:32.279 --> 00:32:34.130 align:start position:0%
looking at these things at at the state
level

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:36.059 align:start position:0%
um you know I didn't prepare for that
 
00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
question so you you got me you got me on
 
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:41.820 align:start position:0%
that one I I I'd be happy to cogitate on
 
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
that and look at each one individually
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
and give you a written answer uh that I
 
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
think that would be more appropriate
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
since I didn't spend any time thinking
 
00:32:51.889 --> 00:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
about it thank you it would be good
 
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams has a question
 
00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
testifying in front of us this morning I
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
am intrigued by the possibility of AI in
 
00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
terms of possibly helping out where we
 
00:33:09.409 --> 00:33:09.419 align:start position:0%
don't have the Staffing and also um you
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
know setting some guard rails for future
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
use of AI by the state how do you see
 
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
that being reviewed and considered and
 
00:33:18.169 --> 00:33:18.179 align:start position:0%
how do you see that playing out in the
 
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
next five years
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
well it's you know with the with the uh
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
massive acceleration of public
 
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
understanding that the AI functions the
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
chat gbt was brought up earlier
 
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
um we're now um that's going to be an
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
agenda item on our next it council
 
00:33:39.049 --> 00:33:39.059 align:start position:0%
meeting and we're going to be talking
 
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
about what we know and what we don't
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
know but it's a national policy issue my
 
00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
peers there's a body called the National
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
Association of State Chief Information
 
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
officers and I will tell you that we're
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
we are caught a little flat-footed at
 
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
the moment with the the massive
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
acceleration from that perspective but
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
we've already been using AI in other
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
areas of states and New Hampshire did
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
this where we you know taking you know
 
00:34:06.409 --> 00:34:06.419 align:start position:0%
your traditional FAQ
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
in creating a smart chat bot that that
 
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
then adapt that you adapt over time so
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
that it actually gives better answers
 
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
we're honestly not very good at that
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
because it requires it's not just
 
00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:21.419 align:start position:0%
technology it's like um when social
 
00:34:23.329 --> 00:34:23.339 align:start position:0%
media first came out and business
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
entities or public policy entities want
 
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
to start engaging on social media they
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
said all right we'll just put something
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
up there and let it go and you can't do
 
00:34:33.649 --> 00:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
that so AI you know whether it's a chat
 
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
bot or or a robotic process automation
 
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
needs people watching it you can't just
 
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
put it out there and let it run a couple
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
reasons one is you know you can keep
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
making it better with little tweaks you
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
can watch some of them some of it's very
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
well instrumented and you can keep an
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
eye on it and make it better and and
 
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
that's our job isn't it you know if
 
00:34:56.089 --> 00:34:56.099 align:start position:0%
we're trying to serve the citizens we
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
want to focus on what we're doing and
 
00:34:59.690 --> 00:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
try to make it better the other thing is
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
you can have some real unintended
 
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
consequences which you're not going to
 
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
find out
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
quickly enough if you're not paying
 
00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
attention so we will be bringing that up
 
00:35:11.089 --> 00:35:11.099 align:start position:0%
at our next it council meeting we will
 
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
be piloting some RPI in in for those
 
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
folks who are we have some you know
 
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
Innovative folks in the state that want
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
to try it out to help solve their
 
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
problems and we'll do some piloting of
 
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
representative brazny has a question
 
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman and thank you for
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh if I heard
 
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
correctly when you listed the things
 
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:38.220 align:start position:0%
that you don't think um are should be
 
00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
the duty of the console
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
um you said B through e and then
 
00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:47.339 align:start position:0%
um G but I think you you didn't say f is
 
00:35:50.569 --> 00:35:50.579 align:start position:0%
do you think that f is okay for um
 
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:53.940 align:start position:0%
actually f is already I feel f is
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
already covered under the duties of the
 
00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
council okay and then I have a follow-up
 
00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
question yes follow-up
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
um so uh for number nine under a
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh is zero would you be acceptable to
 
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
changing this
 
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
um to something else that's similar but
 
00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:14.220 align:start position:0%
more acceptable or do you have feedback
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
more feedback on number nine there all
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
right being the potential cost and
 
00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:20.460 align:start position:0%
feasibility of replacing all
 
00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
proprietary software okay you're
 
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
referring to that yes okay so I did a I
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
did model
 
00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 617 I think it is I did do
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
a cost model for that
 
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
um it's very you know the the
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges with with propriet
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
proprietary software versus open source
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
software in the government space is
 
00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
there isn't a large market for what we
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
do so there isn't um a huge huge
 
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
companies doing these functions like
 
00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
driver license system things like that
 
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
so what we'd end up doing in in that
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
case if we said all right we're going to
 
00:36:59.810 --> 00:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
do everything or as much as possible
 
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
with open source I'd have a massive
 
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
development team you know so when
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
considering that I thought okay well if
 
00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
we're going to do everything open source
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
we have to do it in a way that's secure
 
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
and private and also federally compliant
 
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
which is a huge deal because we accept a
 
00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:17.339 align:start position:0%
lot of federal funds and we get audited
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
on that and there's certain there's
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
requirements for software life cycle
 
00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
maintenance and and things like that so
 
00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
we could absolutely do it be very
 
00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
expensive because I'd be developing and
 
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
and the time to Value would be much
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
slower in many cases because if if
 
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.450 align:start position:0%
slower in many cases because if if
there's

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
software out there that can do something
 
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
like I know I can go out today and buy
 
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
permitting software that's 85 percent of
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
the way ready for me to use and serving
 
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
our citizens and businesses in the state
 
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
um you know I wouldn't I wouldn't have
 
00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
the ability to do that in open source
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
context and I'd have to have a
 
00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
development team build that for us so
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh I think we already do a lot of this
 
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
we look at all right
 
00:38:05.569 --> 00:38:05.579 align:start position:0%
when we go out to procure we don't say
 
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
I'm going to buy open source software or
 
00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
I'm going to buy proprietary software we
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
procure what solves our business problem
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
in the most cost effective way which I
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
think is the appropriate way to look at
 
00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
technology technology is not it's not an
 
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
end in itself the business priorities
 
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
that are our citizen service business
 
00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
priorities are the end
 
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
that's how we should Define our mission
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
that's how we should procure technology
 
00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming today
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
um this is more of a general question
 
00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
um in light of how our other state
 
00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
agencies are sometimes managed how well
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
can you uh investigate such things as AI
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
and other Innovations without any type
 
00:38:59.329 --> 00:38:59.339 align:start position:0%
of legislative directive
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
well we
 
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
all of the contracts in the executive
 
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.050 align:start position:0%
all of the contracts in the executive
branch

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:05.060 align:start position:0%
branch
 
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
come before me
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
for approval so I I actually I know
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
what's going on I know what we're
 
00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
acquiring we have it doit staff roughly
 
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
half of my staff
 
00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:18.980 align:start position:0%
um which is
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
370 authorized positions he's sitting
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
inside agencies working directly with
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
the agency so we actually know what's
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
going on in the agencies we work very
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
closely with them
 
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
um that team who's embedded and we also
 
00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
talk to each other we have regular meet
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
weekly meetings where all of the heads
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
of I.T for each agency get together and
 
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
speak so I I feel like if if and the AI
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
stuff was was
 
00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
done at my initiation so what I said is
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
okay let's how do we innovate here and
 
00:39:57.970 --> 00:39:57.980 align:start position:0%
what agency needs it the most and is is
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
psychologically oriented to trying out
 
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
new things so so I feel like we're in in
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
decent shape there there's a lot of
 
00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
challenges we do have that's not one of
 
00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:07.380 align:start position:0%
our biggest ones though
 
00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:08.750 align:start position:0%
our biggest ones though
follow-up

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
um so I gather now that your much of
 
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
your work is being driven from the base
 
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
up and I think it's laudable
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
um still I will ask again to take a look
 
00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:23.900 align:start position:0%
at innovative
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
aspects that are not quite part of
 
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
what's being driven from the bottom such
 
00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
things as Ai and chat GDP whatever it is
 
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
um things like this uh are you do you
 
00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
feel like you're permitted to take
 
00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
initiative to investigate these areas or
 
00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
do you need legislation to direct you
 
00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
and to investigate these more oh I I
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
understand your question better now I
 
00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
apologize for not answering it the first
 
00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.490 align:start position:0%
apologize for not answering it the first
time

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
uh I feel like we have uh the
 
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
um 21r as as exists today empowers us to
 
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
do that and we do that all the time
 
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
and sometimes the you know the
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
Innovation comes from us thinking about
 
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
it in doit other times it comes from the
 
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
agencies who who who through their own
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
research have found something
 
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
interesting that they that they want to
 
00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:15.950 align:start position:0%
interesting that they that they want to
try

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
before I call on representative muns for
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
a question I want to let everyone who is
 
00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
observing this meeting know that an
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
executive session will begin at the
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
conclusion of this public hearing
 
00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.430 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
question

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:38.300 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of any states that have
 
00:41:40.849 --> 00:41:40.859 align:start position:0%
adopted what this bill is recommending
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
going with all all uh free software
 
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
uh no in fact I I spent almost two years
 
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
as the president of the National
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
Association of Chief Information
 
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
officers so I'm pretty familiar with
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
what's going on around the country in
 
00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
addition to the fact that I've been
 
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
you know I've been doing this for eight
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
years which turns out to be a long time
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
in my business I'm the third most
 
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
tenured State CIO and I have not seen
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Corman has a
 
00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:13.430 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Corman has a
question

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
if systems were to transition from
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
proprietary software produced by
 
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
companies that are actually trying to
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
make money and keep users happy to free
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
and open source are you concerned about
 
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
support issues
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know if there's a question that
 
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
that somebody in state government has
 
00:42:37.609 --> 00:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
who they gonna call
 
00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:41.060 align:start position:0%
yes um in fact the the the
 
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
maintenance and support
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
um for if you know for free and open
 
00:42:47.329 --> 00:42:47.339 align:start position:0%
source it's one of the reasons why for
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
example our websites even they're
 
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
running on Drupal but they're not
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
managed by us I have a third-party
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
company who manages that instance make
 
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
sure they're patching it make sure
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
they're keeping it up to date what what
 
00:43:02.569 --> 00:43:02.579 align:start position:0%
we see in other states and we had a
 
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
question about what other states are
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
doing other states a lot of them are
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
using open source for their website
 
00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:11.099 align:start position:0%
platforms and the number one reason uh
 
00:43:14.569 --> 00:43:14.579 align:start position:0%
for website State website defacement is
 
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that it they put it out there
 
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
and forget about it and then don't patch
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
it because they don't have the staff to
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
do so so one of the things you have to
 
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
look at is is it goes back to my
 
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
statement earlier about any software can
 
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:31.140 align:start position:0%
be run securely or not depending on how
 
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
how well you manage it so I I believe
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
that you know for example we we run our
 
00:43:38.569 --> 00:43:38.579 align:start position:0%
learning management system is open
 
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
source and it works really well in some
 
00:43:44.089 --> 00:43:44.099 align:start position:0%
cases but I have to stay very focused on
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
managing that and I have staff who does
 
00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.990 align:start position:0%
managing that and I have staff who does
that

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:50.220 align:start position:0%
um which is not necessarily typical if I
 
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
were you know if I have a uh you know a
 
00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.050 align:start position:0%
were you know if I have a uh you know a
managed

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
managed
 
00:43:56.089 --> 00:43:56.099 align:start position:0%
um proprietary or managed open source
 
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
scenario so in the case of the learning
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
management system We Own It We own
 
00:44:01.849 --> 00:44:01.859 align:start position:0%
patching it we own keeping it updated we
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
own can you know configuring it things
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
like that so it is definitely more of a
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
burden in that respect and I'll go a
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
little further and say support model is
 
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
something we think really hard about for
 
00:44:17.569 --> 00:44:17.579 align:start position:0%
each and every technology we acquire so
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
it's not about buying this the software
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
or the technology per se that's the
 
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
smallest part of the cost
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
the the largest part of the cost is
 
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
implementing and managing over time in
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
an effective way so when we're looking
 
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
at when I'm looking at a procurement
 
00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:35.220 align:start position:0%
that's coming across my desk and whether
 
00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:37.140 align:start position:0%
I should sign off on it for technology
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at
 
00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
has the support model been thought
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
through are we going to have make sure
 
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
that we're securing the data for our
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
citizens uh things like that so we
 
00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
actually do have our chief information
 
00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
security officer reviews every single
 
00:44:53.569 --> 00:44:53.579 align:start position:0%
contract and we kick it back if we're
 
00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:56.300 align:start position:0%
not satisfied with how that how the the
 
00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
it's going to be managed and how the
 
00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
data is going to be protected
 
00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
representative Christian has a question
 
00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.309 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately I guess I wasn't paying
 
00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
as close attention as representative
 
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
brezhny but you did mention um that
 
00:45:14.569 --> 00:45:14.579 align:start position:0%
there are a few elements in this bill
 
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
that you feel like you're already
 
00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:17.329 align:start position:0%
that you feel like you're already
covering

00:45:17.329 --> 00:45:17.339 align:start position:0%
covering
 
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
um on the I.T Council
 
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:19.730 align:start position:0%
um on the I.T Council
um

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
I guess in your perspective would there
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
be harm in adding it to statute to
 
00:45:25.609 --> 00:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
ensure that that was clear that that's
 
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
part of the council's responsibility
 
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
um or would that restrict you in some
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
way I I don't think it's necessary it's
 
00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
already I think the the
 
00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:38.579 align:start position:0%
the verbiage as it exists or the
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
language as it exists already empowers
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
you know further questions I want to
 
00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:53.339 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here to uh give us
 
00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:54.839 align:start position:0%
your perspective on this proposed
 
00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
legislation for the opportunity I do
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
have one actually I do have one other
 
00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.290 align:start position:0%
have one actually I do have one other
question

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
the department of the legislative budget
 
00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:05.339 align:start position:0%
assistant was charged with producing the
 
00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal note for this bill and they
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
consulted you and there was no time to
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
produce one have you provided an updated
 
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note to the house clerk yep I did
 
00:46:16.849 --> 00:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
um uh I think it was a couple weeks ago
 
00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
we finished it initially the the process
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
went we I was asked for a fiscal note I
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
sent one in they questioned the the
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
um some of my assumptions which I then
 
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
clarified and so there I did see in
 
00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
language that that my fiscal information
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
is in the current language that's on the
 
00:46:37.609 --> 00:46:37.619 align:start position:0%
website right now
 
00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much you're welcome
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
so next I'll call on our final
 
00:46:47.329 --> 00:46:47.339 align:start position:0%
uh presenter for this bill Dennis
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
Goddard of Hopkinton representing
 
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
00:46:58.970 --> 00:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Dennis Goddard and
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
I'm here of course um purely
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
representing my own personal opinions
 
00:47:07.609 --> 00:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
um on the legislation but it's relevant
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
um for you to know
 
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
um these opinions are sort of informed
 
00:47:13.079 --> 00:47:14.690 align:start position:0%
um these opinions are sort of informed
by

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:15.530 align:start position:0%
by
um

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
my position as a director of development
 
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
and operations at Oracle Corporation the
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
world's largest database company
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
specifically I'm employed in the
 
00:47:26.569 --> 00:47:26.579 align:start position:0%
autonomous database division which is
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
that division which is charged with
 
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:30.380 align:start position:0%
figuring out ways to more
 
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
usefully uh marry artificial
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
intelligence in large database
 
00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:36.109 align:start position:0%
intelligence in large database
technology

00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:47:36.119 --> 00:47:39.650 align:start position:0%
technology
so

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day I'm in support of
 
00:47:44.809 --> 00:47:44.819 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
all of the issues listed here are issues
 
00:47:50.809 --> 00:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
that just we as a society as a
 
00:47:50.819 --> 00:47:52.190 align:start position:0%
that just we as a society as a
civilization

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
civilization
 
00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
are going to have to deal with are
 
00:47:56.089 --> 00:47:56.099 align:start position:0%
presently dealing with
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
and desperately need our public
 
00:48:02.809 --> 00:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
institutions to be looking at and some
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
of these are hard
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
are and I've been in a number of
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
companies and organizations that have
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
had to deal with some of these specific
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
enumerated issues how are we going to
 
00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
deal with open source this was a huge
 
00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
problem for us proprietary companies
 
00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:20.579 align:start position:0%
especially about 20 years ago when it
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
got fashionable for some of us employed
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
in large companies to start coding free
 
00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
stuff on our free time
 
00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.890 align:start position:0%
stuff on our free time
um

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
because these things are difficult as a
 
00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
society to talk about I think it's going
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
to be nest because it's easy for
 
00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
organizations not to deal with difficult
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
complex challenging
 
00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
intellectual problems
 
00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
um I think these specific things do need
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
to be enumerated and there needs to be
 
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
some accountability and we need the
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
public institutions in particular
 
00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
um Information Technology Council to be
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
looking at these issues and and give us
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:05.630 align:start position:0%
the public
um

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
some some clarity and some information
 
00:49:07.319 --> 00:49:08.750 align:start position:0%
some some clarity and some information
back

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:09.349 align:start position:0%
back
um

00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to me as a non-expert in
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
our state government whether the
 
00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
information technology is the
 
00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
group that needs to look at these issues
 
00:49:23.329 --> 00:49:23.339 align:start position:0%
but it is absolutely a
 
00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:28.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
I want to speak uh very oh and I want to
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
speak very briefly to a couple of points
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
made by the commissioner I I sort of
 
00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
heard two things
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
um both on the one hand there are things
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
that we already do and on the other hand
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
things that we
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
ought not to look at I would say that
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
those things that are already
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
being looked at that is great that is
 
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
very very good and we need to depend on
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
more than oral tradition and
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge to keep that up
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
we need that clarified and we need some
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
accountability that we as the public are
 
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
going to get some some clarity on
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
certain of these things and no for sure
 
00:50:11.569 --> 00:50:11.579 align:start position:0%
um that the council is is examining
 
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
these issues as for the things that it's
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
asserted it possibly ought not to do
 
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
these are very large things I you know
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
okay real briefly a little bit more
 
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
about my personal life I was doing AI
 
00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:26.099 align:start position:0%
before it was cool
 
00:50:29.089 --> 00:50:29.099 align:start position:0%
um back in 1992 you can look this up
 
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
um I trained a neural network using
 
00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:34.380 align:start position:0%
Intel 486s which was the best that we
 
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
had at the time he had a bank of them
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
back at the University right
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
um it was UW-Madison I could train it to
 
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
do like letter recognition like you
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
could draw letters not mind your own
 
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
network could could recognize those
 
00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:47.210 align:start position:0%
network could could recognize those
um

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
but it's really and and so when this
 
00:50:51.049 --> 00:50:51.059 align:start position:0%
sort of artificial intelligence
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
discussion just a couple years ago uh
 
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
Stephen Hawking before he died suddenly
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
came out and said you know AI is the
 
00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
biggest threat to humanity or something
 
00:50:59.210 --> 00:50:59.220 align:start position:0%
like that and I just thought how
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
overblown this guy's gonna pass to speak
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
um but in the last two or three years
 
00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
um I've come to realize that perhaps
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
um well it's been said and I I no longer
 
00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:15.740 align:start position:0%
think this is exaggeration
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
that artificial intelligence poses more
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
of a change to our society than the
 
00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:21.829 align:start position:0%
of a change to our society than the
internet

00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
internet
 
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
did possibly more than electricity
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
it is necessary for our public
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
institutions to be examining not just
 
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
that but even in a more um immediate
 
00:51:35.049 --> 00:51:35.059 align:start position:0%
sense open source and the two things are
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
ethically related and we need individual
 
00:51:41.089 --> 00:51:41.099 align:start position:0%
uh public bodies particularly a
 
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
Technology Council to be looking at them
 
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
uh so very very briefly on
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
um I just want to mention that support
 
00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned
 
00:51:52.849 --> 00:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
um again largest database company in the
 
00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
world so many of our customers run their
 
00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
databases on Linux
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
um the majority of our developers do
 
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
their work on Linux and not just Oracle
 
00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
IBM uh Red Hat lots and lots of really
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
big companies really very happy to sell
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
you or any other uh government uh
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
contracts for support and development
 
00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
including of Open Source stuff though I
 
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
can't speak I'm not a Salesman for for
 
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
my company
 
00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:24.109 align:start position:0%
my company
um

00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
oh and I I do have to apologize I
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
I I have to take a little bit of umbrage
 
00:52:33.549 --> 00:52:33.559 align:start position:0%
I heard it mentioned by a member
 
00:52:37.609 --> 00:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
something about the old days and Bash I
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
do spend the majority of my waking and
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
working Life In The Bash shell and it's
 
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
a beautiful place to live and I will
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
okay questions for Mr Goddard very
 
00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:52.380 align:start position:0%
interesting point of view I appreciate
 
00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:53.270 align:start position:0%
interesting point of view I appreciate
you

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
being here to offer it to us
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
one question from representative
 
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
barashni thank you chairman and thank
 
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so you
 
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned several times that you think
 
00:53:05.809 --> 00:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
that we should be talking about these
 
00:53:05.819 --> 00:53:06.710 align:start position:0%
that we should be talking about these
issues

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:53:08.809 --> 00:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
um it's a little hard to say just
 
00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
talking about him without having sort of
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
an end product or or kind of a
 
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
conclusion that we should reach can you
 
00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:17.579 align:start position:0%
elaborate on what you think like if if
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
there was a committee or commission that
 
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
had the end result what would those
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
bullet points be thank you oh I I
 
00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:26.099 align:start position:0%
believe that they're explicitly laid out
 
00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
uh in both the bill and the existing
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
legislation we're looking for direction
 
00:53:32.329 --> 00:53:32.339 align:start position:0%
and advice like advise the commissioner
 
00:53:32.339 --> 00:53:33.650 align:start position:0%
and advice like advise the commissioner
on

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
what are we doing about copyleft what
 
00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
are the ethics as the council sees them
 
00:53:42.049 --> 00:53:42.059 align:start position:0%
on the use of artificial intelligence
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
where and how and how is it applicable
 
00:53:47.329 --> 00:53:47.339 align:start position:0%
um that that doesn't necessarily mean
 
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
creating law or or a policy but it it
 
00:53:52.849 --> 00:53:52.859 align:start position:0%
does mean well but perhaps a policy
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
advice to the commissioner
 
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.549 align:start position:0%
advice to the commissioner
um

00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
advice perhaps back to the legislative
 
00:54:02.809 --> 00:54:02.819 align:start position:0%
body certainly I would see a council as
 
00:54:04.849 --> 00:54:04.859 align:start position:0%
being a better tool for some of these
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
fast-moving things then look if we don't
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
do this in the format of a council that
 
00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:12.660 align:start position:0%
can act in a more expeditious manner
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to be dealing with
 
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
these things reactively each and
 
00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
individually in kind of legislation in
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
response to what do we do when we find
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
that people using GPT have
 
00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
the Lord knows done what to our to our
 
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
Democratic processes are
 
00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
consensus on what's real
 
00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
um now these are areas where I believe
 
00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
they are our commissioner and our our
 
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
legislators uh and our executive uh
 
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
require uh some some unified
 
00:54:47.569 --> 00:54:47.579 align:start position:0%
um uh message back just as they
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
presently are on things like how are we
 
00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:50.780 align:start position:0%
going to use information technology
 
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
generally how do we consolidate our
 
00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
systems generally
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
which are already in the legislature are
 
00:54:59.569 --> 00:54:59.579 align:start position:0%
already in past legislation
 
00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
being here and for taking my question
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
when I think about AI in state agencies
 
00:55:14.569 --> 00:55:14.579 align:start position:0%
or in general one of the concerns that
 
00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
comes up is bias
 
00:55:19.609 --> 00:55:19.619 align:start position:0%
and bias can come certainly from
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
training data
 
00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
but it can also be reinforced by the
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
software itself and I'm just wondering
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
what what are your thoughts on where
 
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
what what are the sources of bias and
 
00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
what can be done about it my thoughts
 
00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
are that we are in the Stone Age when it
 
00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
comes to AI I do talk to
 
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:42.670 align:start position:0%
comes to AI I do talk to
um

00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
academics and individuals whose job it
 
00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
is to keep on the absolute Cutting Edge
 
00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
of AI which at this point as an amateur
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
AI follower I can't do anymore it
 
00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:56.700 align:start position:0%
changes so much every six months so much
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
stuff is coming up and as a tech guy
 
00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
that is saying something
 
00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:02.270 align:start position:0%
that is saying something
um

00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
sorry I almost lost a threat on that
 
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:05.990 align:start position:0%
sorry I almost lost a threat on that
um

00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
with respect to bias when I talk to
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
these experts the best things that we
 
00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
have that are come up with are things
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
like if you don't want it to know about
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
pornography don't show it pornography
 
00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
and then it won't be able to generate
 
00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
pornography and that's the best that we
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
can do really and that yeah is the best
 
00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
that we can do right now really these
 
00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
are largely what they call black boxes
 
00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
they're um there is a burgeoning science
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
of explainable AI but that's very
 
00:56:35.809 --> 00:56:35.819 align:start position:0%
limited and most of what a AI stuff is
 
00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
actually out there is you know we
 
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
trained it we don't really understand
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
exactly how it works how it comes up
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
with certain biases a fascinating topic
 
00:56:46.609 --> 00:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
is hacking AI where you classical
 
00:56:49.069 --> 00:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
example a clear and obvious picture of
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
say a dog you ask the thing is this a
 
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
cat or a dog uh or or what is the what
 
00:56:56.089 --> 00:56:56.099 align:start position:0%
is this object comes up with the dog by
 
00:56:58.609 --> 00:56:58.619 align:start position:0%
altering a few pixels in a way that a
 
00:57:00.829 --> 00:57:00.839 align:start position:0%
human would never notice you can push
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
the thing because it's in a very high
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
dimensional space two points that don't
 
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
appear to be close together in a higher
 
00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
Dimension can be Boom the thing oh it's
 
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
a fire hydrant absolutely guaranteed
 
00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
fire hydrant 99 accuracy fire hydrant
 
00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:13.609 align:start position:0%
fire hydrant 99 accuracy fire hydrant
right

00:57:13.609 --> 00:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
um so where these buy and that's that's
 
00:57:16.849 --> 00:57:16.859 align:start position:0%
the kind of bias right where these
 
00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
biases come from how to manipulate them
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
we're only in the Stone Age of being
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
able to figure out how it happens
 
00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.069 align:start position:0%
able to figure out how it happens
um

00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:26.809 --> 00:57:26.819 align:start position:0%
anyone that tells you otherwise is
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
representative munz ask a question thank
 
00:57:35.809 --> 00:57:35.819 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and um thank you for
 
00:57:37.609 --> 00:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
testifying this has been fascinating and
 
00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
you've certainly opened my mind
 
00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:41.780 align:start position:0%
um are there other other
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
issues that we should be addressing that
 
00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:48.839 align:start position:0%
aren't included in this bill that we
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
should include probably and too numerous
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
to mention and appearing too fast to
 
00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:55.980 align:start position:0%
absorb as a society I would view this
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
bill as in a very important I think we
 
00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
have consensus
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
um generally about these particular
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
things being things that in general are
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
in the Zeitgeist we know that open
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
source is a thing we know that
 
00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
copyrights and how large tech companies
 
00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
interface with individuals and our data
 
00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:16.309 align:start position:0%
interface with individuals and our data
um

00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
and how AI is going to play into all of
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
this ethically
 
00:58:22.849 --> 00:58:22.859 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good base to start
 
00:58:22.859 --> 00:58:29.870 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good base to start
from

00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.569 --> 00:58:32.579 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no other questions I thank
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
you for being here today to give us your
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
perspective on this proposed legislation
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
and with no more pink cards in hand I
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
will close the public hearing on House
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
Bill 556 and do we have any blue sheet
 
00:58:46.799 --> 00:58:49.849 align:start position:0%
Bill 556 and do we have any blue sheet
information

00:58:49.849 --> 00:58:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair yes uh House Bill 556
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet none in support one
 
00:58:58.319 --> 00:59:00.049 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet none in support one
opposed

00:59:00.049 --> 00:59:00.059 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:59:00.059 --> 00:59:02.390 align:start position:0%
opposed
online

00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
three in support
 
00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:59:15.049 --> 00:59:15.059 align:start position:0%
it is now time to move to the second
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
part of our activity for the day
 
00:59:19.079 --> 00:59:21.049 align:start position:0%
part of our activity for the day
and

00:59:21.049 --> 00:59:21.059 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
by opening an executive session on House
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
Bill 159 relative to the default service
 
00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
rate for electricity and the chair
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Doug Thomas
 
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
for a motion well actually before I
 
00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:44.930 align:start position:0%
for a motion well actually before I
recognize

00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to explain something that I
 
00:59:51.289 --> 00:59:51.299 align:start position:0%
had a discussion with the ranking member
 
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.530 --> 00:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
I was given information from the clerk
 
00:59:57.540 --> 00:59:58.870 align:start position:0%
I was given information from the clerk
about

00:59:58.870 --> 00:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
the process for coming up with an a
 
01:00:04.609 --> 01:00:04.619 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the committee of
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
without recommendation
 
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
as it turns out
 
01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
the information I was given earlier
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
about voting on all three possible
 
01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.510 align:start position:0%
about voting on all three possible
States

01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
States
 
01:00:20.809 --> 01:00:20.819 align:start position:0%
OTP itl and retain
 
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
is true but only if the Motions are made
 
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:29.220 align:start position:0%
so if emotion is made
 
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:32.700 align:start position:0%
and the resulting vote is 10 10.
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
if no additional emotions are made then
 
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
the bill comes out of committee without
 
01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.589 align:start position:0%
the bill comes out of committee without
recommendation

01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
so going through the process of voting
 
01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
for The Other motions
 
01:00:48.289 --> 01:00:48.299 align:start position:0%
which will both come out 10 10 anyway
 
01:00:50.569 --> 01:00:50.579 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be done
 
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
we can simply vote on one motion if it
 
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
comes out 10 10
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
restrain ourselves discipline ourselves
 
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
to make no further motions
 
01:01:03.289 --> 01:01:03.299 align:start position:0%
and we're done
 
01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
so with that explanation explanation I
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
will now recognize Mr chair Doug Thomas
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
for a motion on House Bill 159 sure just
 
01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
have a question oh okay question from
 
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
representative muns one of the things
 
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
I've been struggling with over the
 
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
weekend and I probably should know this
 
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
but uh humor me
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
um if we if we vote to retain the bill
 
01:01:29.089 --> 01:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
does it go to the floor
 
01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
no okay retain means keep it within the
 
01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:34.740 align:start position:0%
committee okay
 
01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
so that might be the only time
 
01:01:41.089 --> 01:01:41.099 align:start position:0%
if we voted if it was a 10-10 vote
 
01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
we still might want to do a motion to
 
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
retain because there may be some
 
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
some thoughts on whether it makes sense
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
or not correct thank you thank you
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
all right see no further questions I'll
 
01:01:56.569 --> 01:01:56.579 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Thomas for a
 
01:01:59.210 --> 01:01:59.220 align:start position:0%
motion on House Bill 159. thank you Mr
 
01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
chair of the motion uh for HP 159 is to
 
01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:04.730 align:start position:0%
chair of the motion uh for HP 159 is to
retain

01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
retain

01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas is recognized
 
01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh quite simply there is a PC
 
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
docket underway covering the subject and
 
01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
it would be best to wait and see what
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
comes out of that docket and then we can
 
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
take it up later in the fall uh on the
 
01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:31.140 align:start position:0%
retained uh basis
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion
 
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams oh thank you
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
chair Vos
 
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
um this is a really important topic to
 
01:02:40.609 --> 01:02:40.619 align:start position:0%
our constituents in regards to peaks
 
01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
with electric bills and I think that it
 
01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
would be worthy of a subcommittee so I
 
01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
would be happy to serve on a
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to look at this while it is
 
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
being retained so we can bring it back
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McWilliams I
 
01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
think a subcommittee would be justified
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:03.780 align:start position:0%

01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
I have four
 
01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
representative Summers could you be on
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.950 align:start position:0%
 
who's

01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
who's
 
01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
well I already asked representative
 
01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
Summers he agreed so
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
that gives us five with uh
 
01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
now to clarify
 
01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
because we retained this bill we can't
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
address it until
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
after the summer recess so any
 
01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:40.140 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work will have to wait
 
01:05:42.289 --> 01:05:42.299 align:start position:0%
until I think it's mid-august or the
 
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
18th of August something like that
 
01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:48.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
so with that we'll close the executive
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:56.510 align:start position:0%
 
next

01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:05:59.030 --> 01:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
we'll open an exact session on House
 
01:06:02.089 --> 01:06:02.099 align:start position:0%

01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
net energy metering by small
 
01:06:07.370 --> 01:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric generators and I'll call
 
01:06:09.289 --> 01:06:09.299 align:start position:0%

01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%

the Senate coming and we feel it is a
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
better version so we'd like to wait and
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%

01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%

his bill retained uh he feels there
 
01:09:32.329 --> 01:09:32.339 align:start position:0%

seeing no
 
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
necessity for a subcommittee on this
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
bill at the moment will wait until the
 
01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
fall to decide if that's uh
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
going to be required so with that I'll
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
close the executive session on House
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 509

and I'll open an executive session on
 
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
House Bill 81.
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
and recognize representative Thomas for
 
01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
a motion
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair of the motion for HP
 
01:11:30.770 --> 01:11:30.780 align:start position:0%
81 is to retain
 
01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi the second the
 
01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
motion moved and seconded that we retain
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 81 representative Thomas yes
 
01:11:42.169 --> 01:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
we had a uh actually
 
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I have a point of order on on
 
01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
for just the record uh it just occurred
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
to me before uh that we had a
 
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting we had a very good
 
01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
discussion on uh the fees and the
 
01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
subject matter of this bill but we we
 
01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
did not take an official vote on a
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for a recommendation
 
01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
so my question is should we take a vote
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
now so we can present it as a
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee
 
01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:12.709 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee
foreign

01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's not necessary since you did not
 
01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee did not make a
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation it comes to the full
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
committee without recommendations so
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
it's up to the full committee to decide
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
what to do okay thank you for the
 
01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
clarification uh so the the rationale
 
01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
behind the retainers we we heard from
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
the the main speaker AmeriGas that they
 
01:12:35.570 --> 01:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
were making several changes to address
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that were addressed
 
01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
to us unfortunately the the the the
 
01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
issues weren't very clear because we we
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
had stats on numbers of complaints where
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
there were many but we didn't have any
 
01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
uh information as to or the data as to
 
01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
to the the substance of of these
 
01:12:56.770 --> 01:12:56.780 align:start position:0%
complaints and not many went to the AG
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
so we feel that by retaining this bill
 
01:13:04.209 --> 01:13:04.219 align:start position:0%
it will give us the opportunity to
 
01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
analyze and observe the changes that one
 
01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
company is making to address their the
 
01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
concern returns and was also give us
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
chance to investigate the other
 
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
complaints and to put some substance
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
behind them so that when we come back in
 
01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
the fall to discuss this we can make a
 
01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
better determination this place is the
 
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
onus on the uh on that particular
 
01:13:33.890 --> 01:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
company to fulfill their their uh
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
promise is so it also gives us more time
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
to address some of the issues of the
 
01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
complaints to see what their nature was
 
01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
that was that's the rationale behind
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
retain this bill
 
01:13:50.689 --> 01:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh Rose Marie
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
rung has a comment yes thank you very
 
01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
much much Mr chairman I was the Prime
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill and the intent is
 
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
to have a study committee so I think the
 
01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
intent of retain is to study it more but
 
01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
that's also the intent of the bill is to
 
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
study this issue more and I was hoping
 
01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.470 align:start position:0%
study this issue more and I was hoping
that

01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:12.169 --> 01:14:12.179 align:start position:0%
um it it would broaden the people that
 
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:14.460 align:start position:0%
would be looking at this Beyond this one
 
01:14:17.689 --> 01:14:17.699 align:start position:0%
committee I think a study committee if
 
01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
this if the retain was to fail and we
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
went to OTP the study committee could
 
01:14:24.649 --> 01:14:24.659 align:start position:0%
then comprise not only members of this
 
01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:26.580 align:start position:0%
committee but also members of Commerce
 
01:14:28.729 --> 01:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
and consumer affairs because I believe
 
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
some of the practices that were brought
 
01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
up are really fall under their purview
 
01:14:36.410 --> 01:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
we could also bring in through a study
 
01:14:38.570 --> 01:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
committee members from the Attorney
 
01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
General's office who've received some of
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
these complaints and consumer Advocates
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
so the intent of retain and passing this
 
01:14:48.770 --> 01:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
bill is the same it is study the issue
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
my concern with leaving it up to the
 
01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
industry to solve these problems first
 
01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
is is a Fool's game because the major
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
company that is bringing these issues
 
01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
has an F rating by the Better Business
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
Bureau it's on its second lawsuit with
 
01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
the state of Michigan and has civil
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
lawsuits from Florida all the way to
 
01:15:15.649 --> 01:15:15.659 align:start position:0%
Wyoming I don't believe they've
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
established the credibility to be able
 
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
to address their problems honestly so
 
01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
therefore I'm going to vote against
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
retain and hope that emotion of ought to
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
pass would would then follow thank you
 
01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bernardi has a
 
01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:31.550 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bernardi has a
comment

01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
is as a member of the subcommittee we
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
also had considerable discussion with
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
the uh the Gas Association uh that deals
 
01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
with all the companies in New Hampshire
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
and we got a commitment from them to
 
01:15:51.490 --> 01:15:51.500 align:start position:0%
move forward on harmonizing some uh
 
01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
Communications and I think it's very
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
important that you know we get that
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
feedback from them on how they are going
 
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
to operate
 
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
further comment on this uh motion to
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
retain representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh clarification question
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
of the subcommittee
 
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
um did you find issues with any other
 
01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:20.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
there was a sheet passed out with the
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
number of complaints from various gas
 
01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
companies in the state and uh the
 
01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
AmeriGas was uh by at least almost two
 
01:16:36.649 --> 01:16:36.659 align:start position:0%
to one uh more complaints than the next
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
company which was Eastern which had a
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
sizable number of complaints as well
 
01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:45.780 align:start position:0%
but again they were numbers and no one
 
01:16:48.530 --> 01:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
was able to ascertain if it was just a
 
01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
complaint about billing if it was a
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about a delivery day
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
was coming we did hear one or two
 
01:16:58.850 --> 01:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
examples of issues with removing tanks
 
01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
when you're changing companies but there
 
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
was nothing uh substantial with risk
 
01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
those numbers that's why we we have a in
 
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
fact I believe this the Saudi committee
 
01:17:11.530 --> 01:17:11.540 align:start position:0%
uh asked the question
 
01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
the president I might forget who it was
 
01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
but to go all fourth and try and find
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
out what those complaints subsisted of
 
01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.930 align:start position:0%
out what those complaints subsisted of
and

01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:20.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
I will say that uh if anyone was aware
 
01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
of the retained bill that we had last
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
year I think representative partial was
 
01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
part of the committee we as a retained
 
01:17:38.689 --> 01:17:38.699 align:start position:0%
as a retained bill I will be holding uh
 
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
meetings to make sure that we get down
 
01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of what's going on here
 
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:45.300 align:start position:0%
this is not a
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
this is not a brush off we will be
 
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
looking at this
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative partial has a
 
01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.910 align:start position:0%
thank you representative partial has a
comment

01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:17:54.649 --> 01:17:54.659 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair
 
01:17:57.890 --> 01:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
I was also part of that committee and I
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
think that's an accurate uh how Doug
 
01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
represented we yet by and far the
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
business practice of one company
 
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
dominate these uh denominate our
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
hearings for the most part this small
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
what we call the Bob and pop gas
 
01:18:12.239 --> 01:18:13.430 align:start position:0%
what we call the Bob and pop gas
companies

01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
they seem to be rather responsive to the
 
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
to the uh customers in their town and
 
01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
they're well seated there I don't really
 
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
perceive much of a difficulty with them
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
but I am extremely concerned with one
 
01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:26.930 align:start position:0%
but I am extremely concerned with one
player

01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
player
 
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
and I really do think that a study
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
committee could give us the ability to
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
examine the how current these are and
 
01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
what the options are and would put the
 
01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
right people in place not those people
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
from our committee here but um people uh
 
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
legislators from uh consumer uh yes
 
01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
Commerce thank you Commerce in order to
 
01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
uh better serve uh the end goal um
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
and so that's why I'm going to be voting
 
01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
against uh retain and for OTP should
 
01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
have come up
 
01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
representative Munn says a comment thank
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I also will be voting
 
01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
against retain for many of the reasons
 
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
that representative wrong
 
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
um spelled out
 
01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
um I do think one of the significant
 
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
differences between a subcommittee and a
 
01:19:22.669 --> 01:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
study committee is that the study
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
committee is required to submit a formal
 
01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
report of its findings and
 
01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations and my hope would be
 
01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
that that report
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
could be a good road map for the
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
industry to follow and hopefully
 
01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:42.500 align:start position:0%
Implement on their own
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
and you know it would also provide a a
 
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
sense of whether there's any additional
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
legislation that's required so it feels
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
more much more proactive and action
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
oriented than just a subcommittee
 
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
looking into whether we should in fact
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
have a study committee thank you
 
01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
I would comment on Representatives
 
01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
ammon's comment by pointing out that the
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
that retain and a study committee would
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
have roughly the same deadline to
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
produce results
 
01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
and it might take longer to organize and
 
01:20:23.570 --> 01:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
get moving a study committee whereas
 
01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
this committee if we retain the bill
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
could move more quickly to get to a
 
01:20:32.209 --> 01:20:32.219 align:start position:0%
resolution in time for a November 1st or
 
01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
December 1st deadline
 
01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
so retain and a study committee would
 
01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
have the same deadline
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
but retain might get us to the end
 
01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
result more quickly
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
see none I'll ask the clerk to call the
 
01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:54.659 align:start position:0%

01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%

Doug Thomas for a motion
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
anticipating this my emotion I make the
 
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
motion to OTP representative Bernardi I
 
01:21:59.570 --> 01:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
second the motion it's been moved and
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%

01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative Summers just a quick one
 
01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
on the subcommittee although I made the
 
01:22:12.530 --> 01:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
recommendation subcommittee for retain I
 
01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:13.940 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that they actually
 
01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
that the company that's involved
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
actually can move forward so I agree
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
with ought to pass as well
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
further comment on the motion of ought
 
01:22:25.729 --> 01:22:25.739 align:start position:0%
to pass on House Bill 81.
 
01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:27.719 align:start position:0%
representative Marshall
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
yes we recognize that Justice delayed is
 
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
Justice denied but I want to make sure
 
01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
that we get to the bottom of this twenty
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
dollar service fee that one of our
 
01:22:37.490 --> 01:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
members is being charged the quicker the
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%

18-2 by about of 18 to 2 the motion
 
01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:46.440 align:start position:0%

representative McWilliams just a
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
question for the chair is this a
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
potential bill for the consent calendar
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
yes without objection we'll put this on
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%

01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
in my thought dad is looking into trying
 
01:32:13.390 --> 01:32:13.400 align:start position:0%
to get rid of somebody
 
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:32:34.189 --> 01:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
so my motive was if we just we're gonna
 
01:32:36.649 --> 01:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
do it no matter what
 
01:32:36.659 --> 01:32:38.090 align:start position:0%
do it no matter what
so

01:32:38.090 --> 01:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:40.729 --> 01:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
let's not debate it on the floor it's a
 
01:32:44.649 --> 01:32:44.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
and Let It Go
 
01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
you know I want to debate because it
 
01:32:53.410 --> 01:32:53.420 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
01:32:57.550 --> 01:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:05.209 --> 01:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
01:33:06.900 --> 01:34:26.330 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah

01:34:26.330 --> 01:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:35.570 --> 01:35:35.580 align:start position:0%
ladies and Gentlemen please retake your
 
01:35:35.580 --> 01:36:02.149 align:start position:0%
ladies and Gentlemen please retake your
seats

01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay let's resume our exact session and
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
I will put you all on notice that we are
 
01:36:09.050 --> 01:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
take our lunch break starting at 11
 
01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:14.390 align:start position:0%
take our lunch break starting at 11
o'clock

01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
and we will return at 12 o'clock to
 
01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
finish the business of the day if we
 
01:36:20.810 --> 01:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
have not finished it
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
before that and I don't anticipate that
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
we will finish it before that
 
01:36:28.729 --> 01:36:28.739 align:start position:0%
the reason for the early lunch hour is
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
one of our members has to go present a
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
so we'll need to take a break for that
 
01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:38.219 align:start position:0%
to happen so we might as well be
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
productive and have lunch and eat during
 
01:36:43.610 --> 01:36:43.620 align:start position:0%
that that break
 
01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:44.930 align:start position:0%
that that break
okay

01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:48.830 align:start position:0%
okay
pardon

01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:50.209 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:36:50.209 --> 01:36:50.219 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
if you could go find him please we'd
 
01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
like to resume our activity here this
 
01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:57.709 align:start position:0%
like to resume our activity here this
afternoon

01:36:57.709 --> 01:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
so next
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open a executive session
 
01:37:05.930 --> 01:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
for house bill 616.
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
and recognize representative Doug Thomas
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%

01:37:14.570 --> 01:37:14.580 align:start position:0%
on hb616 is to retain
 
01:37:17.810 --> 01:37:17.820 align:start position:0%

01:37:19.729 --> 01:37:19.739 align:start position:0%
second the motion
 
01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded that we
 
01:37:22.990 --> 01:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
retain House Bill
 
01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
616 representative
 
01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:38.209 --> 01:37:38.219 align:start position:0%
this bill is relative to administration
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's renewable portfolio
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
standard and it's recommended it was uh
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
sponsored by representative
 
01:37:51.649 --> 01:37:51.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
no McWilliams I'm sorry I'm sorry McLean
 
01:37:58.610 --> 01:37:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:01.490 --> 01:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
McLean Mark McLean that's correct Mark
 
01:38:06.010 --> 01:38:06.020 align:start position:0%
McLean I am now I'm there I you know
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative Mark lean submit this
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
bill it had very interesting points but
 
01:38:15.470 --> 01:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
we'd like to um wait and see what
 
01:38:19.370 --> 01:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
happens uh down line uh uh the sponsor
 
01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
would like to see something out of it
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
but but uh we we think that retaining uh
 
01:38:28.370 --> 01:38:28.380 align:start position:0%
will allow us a little time to digest uh
 
01:38:29.649 --> 01:38:29.659 align:start position:0%
parts of it
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
it may be worth studying later on we're
 
01:38:34.970 --> 01:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
not sure but that's the main reason for
 
01:38:38.570 --> 01:38:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:41.689 --> 01:38:41.699 align:start position:0%
to retain representative McWilliams
 
01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
each of those
 
01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:44.149 align:start position:0%
each of those
um

01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:45.770 --> 01:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
there was a proposal as part of this
 
01:38:47.870 --> 01:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
bill to add nuclear to the renewable
 
01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard which I think is a
 
01:38:51.649 --> 01:38:51.659 align:start position:0%
rather controversial move considering
 
01:38:53.209 --> 01:38:53.219 align:start position:0%
that nuclear actually does generate
 
01:38:57.050 --> 01:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
waste and so we're a little bit
 
01:38:58.209 --> 01:38:58.219 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
lumping nuclear as part of our current
 
01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard setup I do
 
01:39:05.629 --> 01:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
think that there may be something to
 
01:39:07.729 --> 01:39:07.739 align:start position:0%
look at if we retain this bill and so I
 
01:39:10.129 --> 01:39:10.139 align:start position:0%
would support a retain but my knee-jerk
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
reaction would probably be itl so I'm
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
going to vote retain and for those
 
01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:15.290 align:start position:0%
going to vote retain and for those
reasons

01:39:15.290 --> 01:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
further comment on the motion to retain
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 616.
 
01:39:23.209 --> 01:39:23.219 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
01:39:25.370 --> 01:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm in favor of
 
01:39:27.410 --> 01:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
retaining as well I know what they the
 
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
nuclear aspect ironically uh President
 
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
Biden just spoke in polling this morning
 
01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
and said the United States is going to
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
start building nuclear reactors in
 
01:39:38.689 --> 01:39:38.699 align:start position:0%
Poland so um I'm sure nuclear power will
 
01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:41.159 align:start position:0%
be changing here in the U.S or possibly
 
01:39:41.159 --> 01:39:43.370 align:start position:0%
be changing here in the U.S or possibly
soon

01:39:43.370 --> 01:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
soon
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
further comment on the motion to retain
 
01:39:47.930 --> 01:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
House Bill 616 representative Doug
 
01:39:50.090 --> 01:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
Thomas yes thank you Mr chair just for
 
01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
clarification uh the subject matter of
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
uh nuclear was in terms of small-scale
 
01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639 align:start position:0%
modular which is a new safe small
 
01:40:03.850 --> 01:40:03.860 align:start position:0%
technology and that is a basis of of
 
01:40:07.129 --> 01:40:07.139 align:start position:0%
Investigation uh as opposed to the large
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
scale which we have no no desire for
 
01:40:16.370 --> 01:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:18.770 --> 01:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
I will not be voting in favor of
 
01:40:21.649 --> 01:40:21.659 align:start position:0%
the motion to retain this bill I am all
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
in favor of small modular nuclear
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
technology coming to Market I don't see
 
01:40:30.169 --> 01:40:30.179 align:start position:0%
that happening
 
01:40:33.770 --> 01:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
within a decade and even if it did it
 
01:40:36.890 --> 01:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
would be inappropriate to um
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
call it renewable and lump it into the
 
01:40:40.970 --> 01:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard as this
 
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
bill would so I'll be voting no on
 
01:40:48.530 --> 01:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:50.450 --> 01:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:40:52.250 --> 01:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the clerk to call the roll on
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
the motion to retain house bill 616.

01:41:48.970 --> 01:41:48.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:51.890 --> 01:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
thirteen to seven
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
I have out of 13 to 7 the committee will
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
retain house bill 616.
 
01:42:00.890 --> 01:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
and we will decide in the fall whether
 
01:42:05.330 --> 01:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
or not a subcommittee is necessary to
 
01:42:08.689 --> 01:42:08.699 align:start position:0%
complete our examination of this
 
01:42:08.699 --> 01:42:10.430 align:start position:0%
complete our examination of this
legislation

01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll close the exact
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 616 and now
 
01:42:21.410 --> 01:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
we will open an exact session on House
 
01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:22.570 align:start position:0%
we will open an exact session on House
Bill

01:42:22.570 --> 01:42:22.580 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
622 and I'll recognize representative JD
 
01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I move ought to
 
01:42:36.169 --> 01:42:36.179 align:start position:0%
pass and I offer an amendment
 
01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas
 
01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:40.189 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas
second

01:42:40.189 --> 01:42:40.199 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded that we
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
judge hb622 to be ought to pass with an
 
01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:47.830 align:start position:0%
judge hb622 to be ought to pass with an
amendment

01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:42:52.250 --> 01:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh in the discussion
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
that we had on this bill and the hearing
 
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
that we had on this bill
 
01:43:03.050 --> 01:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
the largest concern was that we would be
 
01:43:05.930 --> 01:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
shutting off the opportunity for for
 
01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:09.719 align:start position:0%
people to have a voice uh periodically
 
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
with the with the Department of energy
 
01:43:15.709 --> 01:43:15.719 align:start position:0%
and so working with the Department of
 
01:43:18.649 --> 01:43:18.659 align:start position:0%
energy crafting Amendment
 
01:43:23.810 --> 01:43:23.820 align:start position:0%
um that uh basically permits or requires
 
01:43:26.090 --> 01:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
the department to at least on an annual
 
01:43:31.870 --> 01:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
basis hold the meeting with a a large
 
01:43:34.669 --> 01:43:34.679 align:start position:0%
contingent of
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
this pretty much the same folks that uh
 
01:43:41.149 --> 01:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
that were in engaged in the previous uh
 
01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
easy board meetings
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment is being passed around
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:55.739 align:start position:0%
uh okay so it's been moved and seconded
 
01:43:57.169 --> 01:43:57.179 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
amend House Bill 622 with Amendment zero
 
01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
six zero seven h
 
01:44:06.169 --> 01:44:06.179 align:start position:0%
hopefully you all have a copy of the
 
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
amendment by now is there any comment on
 
01:44:11.209 --> 01:44:11.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas thank you Mr
 
01:44:16.010 --> 01:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
chair I think the amendment serves the
 
01:44:17.709 --> 01:44:17.719 align:start position:0%
purpose of what was the basic concern
 
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
and it allows the department of energy
 
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
to hold
 
01:44:27.229 --> 01:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
a hearing uh meeting I guess to cover
 
01:44:30.729 --> 01:44:30.739 align:start position:0%
the same issues that were in the
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
easy board I plan to vote for that
 
01:44:37.129 --> 01:44:37.139 align:start position:0%
further comment on the amendment as
 
01:44:39.290 --> 01:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
submitted by representative Bernardi
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
I just want to note for the record that
 
01:44:45.709 --> 01:44:45.719 align:start position:0%
the Energy Efficiency and sustainable
 
01:44:47.930 --> 01:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
energy board was established in 2008 it
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
consists of 18 members representing a
 
01:44:51.649 --> 01:44:51.659 align:start position:0%
cross-section of New Hampshire
 
01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
leadership and it produces an annual
 
01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:55.129 align:start position:0%
leadership and it produces an annual
report

01:44:55.129 --> 01:44:55.139 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
so this amendment basically does a
 
01:45:00.290 --> 01:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
instead of monthly meeting from this
 
01:45:02.450 --> 01:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
esteemed group it looks like there is a
 
01:45:05.090 --> 01:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
once a year annual meeting with the
 
01:45:06.590 --> 01:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
Department of energy to allow the public
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
to air their grievances but I'm not
 
01:45:11.689 --> 01:45:11.699 align:start position:0%
seeing a report and I'm kind of feeling
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
like this doesn't really move the ball
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
forward on Energy Efficiency which is
 
01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:17.820 align:start position:0%
the cheapest dollar we can possibly
 
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
spend the negawatt
 
01:45:22.609 --> 01:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
where we reduce our energy consumption
 
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
by being smart about how we weatherize
 
01:45:26.930 --> 01:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
buildings so for that reason I'm
 
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
concerned that this takes away the core
 
01:45:31.129 --> 01:45:31.139 align:start position:0%
intention of the Energy Efficiency and
 
01:45:34.010 --> 01:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
sustainable energy board lumps an annual
 
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
meeting with some people uh from the
 
01:45:38.209 --> 01:45:38.219 align:start position:0%
public allowed to attend and voice their
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
concerns but doesn't really push forward
 
01:45:43.609 --> 01:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
goals or report and for that reason I
 
01:45:46.129 --> 01:45:46.139 align:start position:0%
would be against the amendment
 
01:45:48.770 --> 01:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
thank you additional comment
 
01:45:51.410 --> 01:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
yes as uh in reviewing the what the easy
 
01:45:57.890 --> 01:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
board does and comparing it to what the
 
01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
department of energy already does there
 
01:46:02.570 --> 01:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
was a redundancy there there is a
 
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
requirement to have an annual Energy
 
01:46:06.890 --> 01:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
report that looks at all the energy
 
01:46:12.290 --> 01:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:14.689 --> 01:46:14.699 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency certainly would be
 
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
part of that so the idea of starting to
 
01:46:21.410 --> 01:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
limit the number of commissions and
 
01:46:23.689 --> 01:46:23.699 align:start position:0%
committees and whatnot that we have was
 
01:46:26.930 --> 01:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
the thrust of the entire bill and the
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
the concern raised was all right we
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
eliminated an opportunity to for folks
 
01:46:34.850 --> 01:46:34.860 align:start position:0%
to have a voice well that's been
 
01:46:37.129 --> 01:46:37.139 align:start position:0%
addressed by the amendment so I I
 
01:46:40.669 --> 01:46:40.679 align:start position:0%
believe the principle
 
01:46:40.679 --> 01:46:41.950 align:start position:0%
believe the principle
um

01:46:41.950 --> 01:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
rationale for not moving forward and
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
consolidating activities has been
 
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.330 align:start position:0%
consolidating activities has been
removed

01:46:50.330 --> 01:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
removed
 
01:46:52.490 --> 01:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
comment thank you I've got a
 
01:46:55.970 --> 01:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
clarification question on lines five
 
01:46:57.530 --> 01:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
through seven
 
01:46:59.330 --> 01:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
um and I'm speaking as an instructional
 
01:47:01.010 --> 01:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
designer now the department shall
 
01:47:04.970 --> 01:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
develop strategies Concepts and tools to
 
01:47:07.370 --> 01:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
enhance Outreach and education programs
 
01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
to increase knowledge and awareness how
 
01:47:12.649 --> 01:47:12.659 align:start position:0%
on Earth do you propose to measure any
 
01:47:19.570 --> 01:47:19.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
I can answer that question as a member
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
of the current member of the easy board
 
01:47:29.090 --> 01:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
the easy board has a subcommittee
 
01:47:32.209 --> 01:47:32.219 align:start position:0%
that's charged with developing education
 
01:47:34.729 --> 01:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
and Outreach programs and they have
 
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
issued an RFP
 
01:47:41.209 --> 01:47:41.219 align:start position:0%
because House Bill 549 last year
 
01:47:43.669 --> 01:47:43.679 align:start position:0%
allocated four hundred thousand dollars
 
01:47:46.510 --> 01:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
to the easy board for
 
01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
accomplishing the tasks described in
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
lines five and six
 
01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
and they have issued an RSP RFP to do a
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
survey to find out what the status of
 
01:48:02.930 --> 01:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
The public's awareness currently is so
 
01:48:06.050 --> 01:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
that they can develop future programs
 
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
and tools to enhance the Public's
 
01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:10.970 align:start position:0%
and tools to enhance the Public's
understanding

01:48:10.970 --> 01:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:48:13.850 --> 01:48:13.860 align:start position:0%
what this legislation would do
 
01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:15.350 align:start position:0%
what this legislation would do
is

01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:48:17.810 --> 01:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
hand that task off to the Department of
 
01:48:20.169 --> 01:48:20.179 align:start position:0%
energy the department of energy already
 
01:48:22.129 --> 01:48:22.139 align:start position:0%
controls the four hundred thousand
 
01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
dollar budget for this
 
01:48:30.770 --> 01:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
procedure this process and so it's
 
01:48:32.990 --> 01:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's unquestionably true that what
 
01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi characterized as
 
01:48:39.370 --> 01:48:39.380 align:start position:0%
a redundancy in statute already exists
 
01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:42.659 align:start position:0%
and this legislation would clear up that
 
01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:44.820 align:start position:0%
redundancy by putting all the
 
01:48:47.689 --> 01:48:47.699 align:start position:0%
responsibility with the for executing
 
01:48:50.030 --> 01:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
this functionality with the Department
 
01:48:52.669 --> 01:48:52.679 align:start position:0%
of energy since they already control the
 
01:48:54.350 --> 01:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
purse strings
 
01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
and furthermore it would provide a way
 
01:49:00.010 --> 01:49:00.020 align:start position:0%
for public input into
 
01:49:05.689 --> 01:49:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:09.229 --> 01:49:09.239 align:start position:0%
a superior way to handle this process
 
01:49:11.450 --> 01:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
01:49:13.490 --> 01:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
as a member of the easy board I can tell
 
01:49:15.950 --> 01:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
you that right now the easy board has
 
01:49:17.209 --> 01:49:17.219 align:start position:0%
very little
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
power or to do anything and very little
 
01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:21.430 align:start position:0%
power or to do anything and very little
authority

01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:49:23.870 --> 01:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
given the statutory changes that were
 
01:49:27.530 --> 01:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
made last year in House Bill 549
 
01:49:30.229 --> 01:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
the one
 
01:49:32.410 --> 01:49:32.420 align:start position:0%
Mission or the one
 
01:49:34.910 --> 01:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
task that they were charged with is
 
01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:36.229 align:start position:0%
task that they were charged with is
developing

01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
developing
 
01:49:40.129 --> 01:49:40.139 align:start position:0%
the educational component and so this
 
01:49:42.109 --> 01:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
simply moves that component into the
 
01:49:43.609 --> 01:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
01:49:43.619 --> 01:49:47.450 align:start position:0%
department of energy
and

01:49:47.450 --> 01:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:49.729 align:start position:0%
 
accomplishes

01:49:49.729 --> 01:49:49.739 align:start position:0%
accomplishes
 
01:49:52.850 --> 01:49:52.860 align:start position:0%
the rest of what house bill 549 set out
 
01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
to do which was to eliminate the easy
 
01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.250 align:start position:0%
to do which was to eliminate the easy
board

01:49:58.250 --> 01:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:50:01.609 --> 01:50:01.619 align:start position:0%
because it's no longer providing
 
01:50:03.709 --> 01:50:03.719 align:start position:0%
an essential function
 
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a comment
 
01:50:11.810 --> 01:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and as the
 
01:50:14.030 --> 01:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
previous member of the easy board two
 
01:50:17.530 --> 01:50:17.540 align:start position:0%
years prior to the chair I can vouch
 
01:50:20.930 --> 01:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
with with his concerns having sat
 
01:50:23.689 --> 01:50:23.699 align:start position:0%
through several meetings uh
 
01:50:26.689 --> 01:50:26.699 align:start position:0%
that were basically presentations
 
01:50:30.530 --> 01:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
um so uh I think the time and the term
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
of the easy board has been surpassed now
 
01:50:36.010 --> 01:50:36.020 align:start position:0%
that we have the department of energy
 
01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
further comment representative munz has
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
a comment thank you Mr chair
 
01:50:45.649 --> 01:50:45.659 align:start position:0%
um what one of the benefits of the the
 
01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
easy board as I see it is that it has
 
01:50:51.649 --> 01:50:51.659 align:start position:0%
um members on it that represent
 
01:50:53.930 --> 01:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
different constituencies including the
 
01:50:55.850 --> 01:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
business community in the bill in the in
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
the Home Builders Association
 
01:51:00.530 --> 01:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
and it's one thing to say that
 
01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
um you know the department will conduct
 
01:51:04.250 --> 01:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
a public hearing to to to which
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
everybody is allowed to come and speak
 
01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
to comment on decisions that the that
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
the department is uh contemplating or or
 
01:51:16.250 --> 01:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
quite frankly is already made
 
01:51:19.729 --> 01:51:19.739 align:start position:0%
that's a lot different than having those
 
01:51:21.649 --> 01:51:21.659 align:start position:0%
constituencies like the business
 
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
community and the builders be part of
 
01:51:26.689 --> 01:51:26.699 align:start position:0%
the process of developing what the
 
01:51:29.570 --> 01:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
recommendation should be
 
01:51:34.370 --> 01:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
um and since you know they're the ones
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
that are going to be impacted the most
 
01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
by what some of these proposals are
 
01:51:40.490 --> 01:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
would make seem to make sense to me to
 
01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
have them have a seat at the table in
 
01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
developing those and as I can see it
 
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
right now the easy board is the only way
 
01:51:50.090 --> 01:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:51.709 --> 01:51:51.719 align:start position:0%
further comment
 
01:51:53.810 --> 01:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
representative partial has a comment
 
01:51:56.030 --> 01:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chair I would I would agree
 
01:51:57.370 --> 01:51:57.380 align:start position:0%
though with representative moms
 
01:51:59.390 --> 01:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
considering the current representation
 
01:52:01.729 --> 01:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
of the easy board I welcome the
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
redundancy from what may be a very
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
different perspective
 
01:52:06.649 --> 01:52:06.659 align:start position:0%
and which may not be duplicated by an
 
01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
annual public comment meeting uh on
 
01:52:13.930 --> 01:52:13.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:18.410 --> 01:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
speaking of redundancy um yes just
 
01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
agreeing that while we all
 
01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
um appreciate the urge to get rid of
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
Superfluous and unnecessary meetings I
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
think that a single annual meeting for
 
01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
public input is in no way um
 
01:52:36.350 --> 01:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
sufficient for the amount of input that
 
01:52:40.490 --> 01:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay any further comment representative
 
01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:43.669 align:start position:0%
okay any further comment representative
Reynolds

01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
Reynolds
 
01:52:46.729 --> 01:52:46.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yeah I want to say
 
01:52:49.490 --> 01:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
that while I I do appreciate uh the
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
spirit of
 
01:52:51.119 --> 01:52:51.950 align:start position:0%
spirit of
um

01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:54.530 --> 01:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi's efforts in in
 
01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
crafting the amendment and and if I you
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
know take the
 
01:53:01.129 --> 01:53:01.139 align:start position:0%
paragraphs five and six especially you
 
01:53:04.250 --> 01:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
know on their face I think that's those
 
01:53:07.070 --> 01:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
are really laudable goals but I I also
 
01:53:09.649 --> 01:53:09.659 align:start position:0%
share the concerns
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
um that an annual
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
meeting with sort of one way
 
01:53:18.290 --> 01:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
uh you know input a public hearing Style
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
versus the the collaborative
 
01:53:21.119 --> 01:53:21.709 align:start position:0%
versus the the collaborative
um

01:53:21.709 --> 01:53:21.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:23.639 align:start position:0%
style of the
 
01:53:27.530 --> 01:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
of the easy board function currently
 
01:53:29.570 --> 01:53:29.580 align:start position:0%
um is wouldn't it wouldn't be
 
01:53:31.729 --> 01:53:31.739 align:start position:0%
satisfactory I mean I I can definitely
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
see that
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
the need to reduce perhaps the frequency
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
of of easy board meetings from monthly
 
01:53:40.250 --> 01:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
to perhaps quarterly
 
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
um but I I I guess I feel like this bill
 
01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
goes even even if amended as proposed
 
01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
would would sort of go too far
 
01:53:48.239 --> 01:53:49.669 align:start position:0%
would would sort of go too far
thanks

01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:53:52.250 --> 01:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for that comment since uh the
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
easy board has no real responsibility no
 
01:53:56.510 --> 01:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
real Authority
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
whether it meets monthly weekly
 
01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
quarterly kind of doesn't matter if it
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
really doesn't accomplish anything that
 
01:54:06.530 --> 01:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
would be my comment
 
01:54:08.689 --> 01:54:08.699 align:start position:0%
knowing that representative Bernardi has
 
01:54:10.850 --> 01:54:10.860 align:start position:0%
to leave here in five minutes I'm going
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
to ask that he called the role on the
 
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
question of the amendment
 
01:54:21.790 --> 01:54:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:24.540 align:start position:0%

uh look at the number of bills that we
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%

01:56:03.119 --> 01:56:05.590 align:start position:0%
are retaining and it makes me a bit
nervous

um my notes say that there was an ought
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
to pass motion made and seconded and
 
01:56:18.119 --> 01:56:18.830 align:start position:0%
to pass motion made and seconded and
then

01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:18.840 align:start position:0%

I think that is correct
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
yeah we do believe that is correct
 
01:56:39.370 --> 01:56:39.380 align:start position:0%
so and instead of discussing with
 
01:56:41.810 --> 01:56:41.820 align:start position:0%
okay representative Bernardi is
 
01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:42.890 align:start position:0%

01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas
 
01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:54.169 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas
second

01:56:54.169 --> 01:56:54.179 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:57:06.250 --> 01:57:06.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:06.260 --> 01:57:08.770 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:57:08.770 --> 01:57:08.780 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
I did we draw a second uh we draw the uh
 
01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:14.930 align:start position:0%
I did we draw a second uh we draw the uh
retain

01:57:14.930 --> 01:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
retain
 
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay now you can make a new motion to
 
01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:17.810 align:start position:0%
okay now you can make a new motion to
retain

01:57:17.810 --> 01:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
retain
 
01:57:19.790 --> 01:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
what point of order
 
01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:21.770 align:start position:0%
what point of order
yes

01:57:21.770 --> 01:57:21.780 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:57:24.649 --> 01:57:24.659 align:start position:0%
um so I guess now I'm confused
 
01:57:26.810 --> 01:57:26.820 align:start position:0%
um we had a motion to ought to pass and
 
01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
then underneath that motion we had an
 
01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:30.229 align:start position:0%
then underneath that motion we had an
amendment

01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
since we don't we have to finish the
 
01:57:34.729 --> 01:57:34.739 align:start position:0%
process because if the emotion had been
 
01:57:36.050 --> 01:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
to retained we wouldn't have introduced
 
01:57:37.370 --> 01:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:57:39.350 --> 01:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
well the original motion was ought to
 
01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:41.330 align:start position:0%
well the original motion was ought to
pass

01:57:41.330 --> 01:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:57:44.450 --> 01:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
and then representative Bernardi offered
 
01:57:47.570 --> 01:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
Amendment zero six zero seven H the
 
01:57:50.450 --> 01:57:50.460 align:start position:0%
amendment failed so that returns us back
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
to the ought to pass motion as
 
01:57:55.070 --> 01:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative wrong pointed out
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi then withdrew
 
01:57:58.970 --> 01:57:58.980 align:start position:0%
the ought to pass motion meaning there's
 
01:58:01.790 --> 01:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
no motion on the floor so I'm asking
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas to make a motion
 
01:58:05.810 --> 01:58:05.820 align:start position:0%
to retain I I understand that I I
 
01:58:07.490 --> 01:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
thought we'd have to finish the process
 
01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:12.850 --> 01:58:12.860 align:start position:0%
and so the motion is to retain
 
01:58:15.649 --> 01:58:15.659 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi second the
 
01:58:18.169 --> 01:58:18.179 align:start position:0%
motion moved and seconded to retain any
 
01:58:21.709 --> 01:58:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
their motion on to call the roll rather
 
01:58:28.490 --> 01:58:28.500 align:start position:0%

03:06:31.670 --> 03:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
and that's what the study committee that
 
03:06:34.610 --> 03:06:34.620 align:start position:0%
this bill created that's what its job
 
03:06:36.830 --> 03:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
was to do was to figure out what bills
 
03:06:40.730 --> 03:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
need to be re-codified and where
 
03:06:43.130 --> 03:06:43.140 align:start position:0%
so what this amendment does is that it
 
03:06:47.809 --> 03:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
took all of the rsas starting on as what
 
03:06:49.370 --> 03:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the amendment starting on
 
03:06:50.809 --> 03:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
line 20
 
03:06:53.809 --> 03:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
and going through to
 
03:06:53.819 --> 03:06:56.990 align:start position:0%
and going through to
line

03:06:56.990 --> 03:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:00.889 --> 03:07:00.899 align:start position:0%
one on page two it moved all of those
 
03:07:03.590 --> 03:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
rsas from the repeal section of the
 
03:07:06.110 --> 03:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
legislation into the study committee
 
03:07:10.010 --> 03:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
section of the of the legislation
 
03:07:13.010 --> 03:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
the only piece of
 
03:07:15.410 --> 03:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
the only statute that remained in the
 
03:07:19.490 --> 03:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
repeal section was rsa's 376 a
 
03:07:21.469 --> 03:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
relative to Transportation Network
 
03:07:24.290 --> 03:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
companies and that
 
03:07:26.929 --> 03:07:26.939 align:start position:0%
section was re-codified
 
03:07:29.870 --> 03:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
in the original bill
 
03:07:31.790 --> 03:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
in the proper place
 
03:07:38.330 --> 03:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
that's uh now 350 RSA 359-u
 
03:07:40.670 --> 03:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
so that's what the amendment did it it
 
03:07:44.450 --> 03:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
kept that one section in the repeal
 
03:07:46.370 --> 03:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
section because it's been recodified
 
03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
already and it put everything else in
 
03:07:52.130 --> 03:07:52.140 align:start position:0%
the study committee section of the bill
 
03:07:55.550 --> 03:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
so it's a pretty simple Amendment and I
 
03:07:58.130 --> 03:07:58.140 align:start position:0%
asked for your support and now I look
 
03:08:05.090 --> 03:08:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:07.550 --> 03:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a comment thank
 
03:08:09.230 --> 03:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
03:08:11.990 --> 03:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
um I did I did look this this amendment
 
03:08:13.130 --> 03:08:13.140 align:start position:0%
over and
 
03:08:15.050 --> 03:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
um I think it accomplishes everything
 
03:08:19.010 --> 03:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
that you stated and is consistent with
 
03:08:20.929 --> 03:08:20.939 align:start position:0%
the concerns raised in the hearing so to
 
03:08:22.429 --> 03:08:22.439 align:start position:0%
me it um
 
03:08:24.410 --> 03:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
it it it's certainly something that we
 
03:08:26.570 --> 03:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
should adopt
 
03:08:28.370 --> 03:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
thank you additional comments on this
 
03:08:33.170 --> 03:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:35.929 --> 03:08:35.939 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi it's a question
 
03:08:40.490 --> 03:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chair did the other
 
03:08:44.030 --> 03:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
department heads uh that had testified
 
03:08:45.950 --> 03:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
and raised issues that they agree with
 
03:08:48.590 --> 03:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
this have they seen it or or we just
 
03:08:50.570 --> 03:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
wholesale he did it so it's you know we
 
03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't even need to know actually the uh
 
03:08:55.250 --> 03:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
03:08:57.050 --> 03:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if it was a commissioner or
 
03:08:58.790 --> 03:08:58.800 align:start position:0%

03:09:00.889 --> 03:09:00.899 align:start position:0%

03:09:08.690 --> 03:09:08.700 align:start position:0%

for pointing that out so it can't go on
 
03:12:26.870 --> 03:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar so it'll go on
 
03:12:28.429 --> 03:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
the regular calendar
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%

03:12:48.530 --> 03:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
we will move to
 
03:12:52.370 --> 03:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:55.910 --> 03:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
and I'll recognize representative for a
 
03:12:55.920 --> 03:12:57.050 align:start position:0%
and I'll recognize representative for a
motion

03:12:57.050 --> 03:12:57.060 align:start position:0%

03:13:05.269 --> 03:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
representative Summers is recognized I
 
03:13:07.010 --> 03:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
second the motion it's been moved and
 
03:13:11.510 --> 03:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
seconded that we itl House Bill 523
 
03:13:14.030 --> 03:13:14.040 align:start position:0%

thank you during the testimony
 
03:13:19.070 --> 03:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
um I believe the doe testified that
 
03:13:22.389 --> 03:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
there's an open docket de
 
03:13:26.870 --> 03:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
22-060 to study net metering and they're
 
03:13:28.370 --> 03:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
against the bill because they would like
 
03:13:30.410 --> 03:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
to have that docket finish and and have
 
03:13:32.630 --> 03:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
the findings before we make any more
 
03:13:35.450 --> 03:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
changes to net metering also last year
 
03:13:39.710 --> 03:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
HB 1599 FN passed which which requested
 
03:13:43.550 --> 03:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
the puc to do a study on net metering so
 
03:13:44.990 --> 03:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense that we asked them
 
03:13:46.490 --> 03:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
to do a study and then at the same time
 
03:13:49.730 --> 03:13:49.740 align:start position:0%
make changes thank you
 
03:13:52.730 --> 03:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
further comment on the motion to itl
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 3 5 23.
 
03:13:58.910 --> 03:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
03:14:00.950 --> 03:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
yes I see this bill is offering a more
 
03:14:03.469 --> 03:14:03.479 align:start position:0%
immediate relief and considering that we
 
03:14:03.479 --> 03:14:04.370 align:start position:0%
immediate relief and considering that we
have

03:14:04.370 --> 03:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:14:06.349 --> 03:14:06.359 align:start position:0%
Industries in our state that are unable
 
03:14:08.750 --> 03:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of economy scale by
 
03:14:11.450 --> 03:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
having a five megawatt limit industry
 
03:14:13.550 --> 03:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
such as an officer Bush who instead of
 
03:14:15.950 --> 03:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
lowering their energy costs are forced
 
03:14:19.550 --> 03:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
to make layoffs I see this is a relief
 
03:14:21.410 --> 03:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
bill for those for those industries that
 
03:14:24.170 --> 03:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
are troubled by it and I don't see any
 
03:14:26.269 --> 03:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
problem because the one megawatt was an
 
03:14:28.250 --> 03:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
arbitrary figure to begin with I don't
 
03:14:31.130 --> 03:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
see any problem with going ahead and
 
03:14:33.110 --> 03:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation which we heard
 
03:14:35.090 --> 03:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
testimony could also potentially benefit
 
03:14:39.349 --> 03:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh consumer rates I either see that the
 
03:14:41.809 --> 03:14:41.819 align:start position:0%
well again Justice delayed is Justice
 
03:14:41.819 --> 03:14:43.070 align:start position:0%
well again Justice delayed is Justice
denied

03:14:43.070 --> 03:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
denied
 
03:14:44.990 --> 03:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that
 
03:14:47.809 --> 03:14:47.819 align:start position:0%
further comment on the motion to itl
 
03:14:50.630 --> 03:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 523 representative Wendy
 
03:14:52.790 --> 03:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um during the
 
03:14:55.130 --> 03:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
hearing we heard about the the positive
 
03:14:59.389 --> 03:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
jobs impact of of raising this limit and
 
03:15:01.190 --> 03:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
this bill was also described as a
 
03:15:03.950 --> 03:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
business enabling bill
 
03:15:05.990 --> 03:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to remind people of that
 
03:15:06.950 --> 03:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:15:09.830 --> 03:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds is recognized
 
03:15:14.269 --> 03:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:14.279 --> 03:15:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
I'm

03:15:15.830 --> 03:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
03:15:17.870 --> 03:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
not in favor of
 
03:15:19.730 --> 03:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislate I'm in favor
 
03:15:23.990 --> 03:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
of passing this bill the uh one megawatt
 
03:15:28.370 --> 03:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
limit on the scale of
 
03:15:30.230 --> 03:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
distributed generation that can
 
03:15:31.849 --> 03:15:31.859 align:start position:0%
interconnect is a is a completely
 
03:15:35.450 --> 03:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
arbitrary limit and it's a limit that
 
03:15:38.450 --> 03:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of potentially
 
03:15:42.769 --> 03:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
viable distributed generation uneconomic
 
03:15:45.230 --> 03:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
because of
 
03:15:46.670 --> 03:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of fixed costs to
 
03:15:47.990 --> 03:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
developing any project into
 
03:15:50.170 --> 03:15:50.180 align:start position:0%
interconnecting it to the grid
 
03:15:53.450 --> 03:15:53.460 align:start position:0%
and therefore when all of those fixed
 
03:15:55.849 --> 03:15:55.859 align:start position:0%
costs are forced to be
 
03:15:55.859 --> 03:15:56.809 align:start position:0%
costs are forced to be
um

03:15:56.809 --> 03:15:56.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:59.150 --> 03:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
born by a a
 
03:16:01.969 --> 03:16:01.979 align:start position:0%
generation asset that is arbitrarily
 
03:16:05.349 --> 03:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
limited to a relatively small scale
 
03:16:08.990 --> 03:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh it it makes it makes those projects
 
03:16:11.809 --> 03:16:11.819 align:start position:0%
uneconomic for business to pursue
 
03:16:14.210 --> 03:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
um you know one of the
 
03:16:16.550 --> 03:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
desires we all have is to have more
 
03:16:18.710 --> 03:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
distributed generation B
 
03:16:21.050 --> 03:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
uh economic and be able to deliver
 
03:16:24.309 --> 03:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
low-cost energy for businesses
 
03:16:27.710 --> 03:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
and institutions and municipalities
 
03:16:29.929 --> 03:16:29.939 align:start position:0%
um in our state and so
 
03:16:32.450 --> 03:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
uh I'm in favor of expanding the limit
 
03:16:36.170 --> 03:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
to five megawatts thank you
 
03:16:38.389 --> 03:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a comment
 
03:16:41.990 --> 03:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair just I have to agree uh
 
03:16:44.690 --> 03:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
with the um uh
 
03:16:47.990 --> 03:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
um with the representative brisney's
 
03:16:50.630 --> 03:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
comments about the puc they are in
 
03:16:52.730 --> 03:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
consultation right now with their docket
 
03:16:55.130 --> 03:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
and anything we do now can just cause
 
03:16:59.150 --> 03:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
some some confusion I I'm all one for
 
03:17:01.670 --> 03:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
waiting to see what the puc does and
 
03:17:03.410 --> 03:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
from there we can go on to do better
 
03:17:05.210 --> 03:17:05.220 align:start position:0%
things but I don't think we should do
 
03:17:06.830 --> 03:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
something now that's going to confuse
 
03:17:09.110 --> 03:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
them later on
 
03:17:11.750 --> 03:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
additional comment representative Gorman
 
03:17:14.570 --> 03:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh yeah regarding the
 
03:17:17.210 --> 03:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
puc I mean we're the legislature we have
 
03:17:20.090 --> 03:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
oversight over them so I'm I'm not as
 
03:17:22.910 --> 03:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about the puc docket uh but I
 
03:17:24.170 --> 03:17:24.180 align:start position:0%
was also going to point out that during
 
03:17:26.809 --> 03:17:26.819 align:start position:0%
testimony from um the representative
 
03:17:30.050 --> 03:17:30.060 align:start position:0%
from IBEW Local 490 he talked about some
 
03:17:32.990 --> 03:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
of the facilities in state already that
 
03:17:35.389 --> 03:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
really could take advantage of going
 
03:17:38.210 --> 03:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
over one megawatt uh you mentioned
 
03:17:40.250 --> 03:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
Associated grocers in Pembroke
 
03:17:43.190 --> 03:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
Anheuser-Busch and Merrimack a school in
 
03:17:46.429 --> 03:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
Dover and and he said and I I this
 
03:17:47.750 --> 03:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
really struck me that it would be like
 
03:17:50.750 --> 03:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
giving a tax break to businesses because
 
03:17:53.269 --> 03:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
it's lowering their operating costs and
 
03:17:54.650 --> 03:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
I know that there's a lot of interest in
 
03:17:56.690 --> 03:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
the legislature to giving tax breaks to
 
03:17:58.490 --> 03:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
businesses this would have the same
 
03:17:58.500 --> 03:18:02.570 align:start position:0%
businesses this would have the same
effect

03:18:02.570 --> 03:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:07.070 --> 03:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:10.190 --> 03:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
who would pay for that tax break though
 
03:18:12.050 --> 03:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
that's the question
 
03:18:13.849 --> 03:18:13.859 align:start position:0%
would you want rate payers to pay for
 
03:18:15.830 --> 03:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
that tax break that happens in any tax
 
03:18:17.750 --> 03:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
break right this the slack has to get
 
03:18:20.150 --> 03:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
taken up or budget has to get cut for
 
03:18:22.849 --> 03:18:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:24.650 --> 03:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
but this is a hidden tax break that
 
03:18:27.050 --> 03:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
nobody would see
 
03:18:30.950 --> 03:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:33.130 --> 03:18:33.140 align:start position:0%
just a rhetorical question
 
03:18:35.750 --> 03:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh let's see do we have
 
03:18:37.790 --> 03:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
any other comments okay yeah I'll let
 
03:18:39.650 --> 03:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
you make a second comment
 
03:18:42.650 --> 03:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
representative chairman uh no no I would
 
03:18:44.809 --> 03:18:44.819 align:start position:0%
say in response to your your question
 
03:18:44.819 --> 03:18:45.889 align:start position:0%
say in response to your your question
there

03:18:45.889 --> 03:18:45.899 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:18:48.290 --> 03:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
um that's the wonderful thing about
 
03:18:51.590 --> 03:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
renewable energy as I mentioned in my
 
03:18:53.929 --> 03:18:53.939 align:start position:0%
uh testimony
 
03:18:56.269 --> 03:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
the fuel cost of renewable energy is
 
03:18:58.330 --> 03:18:58.340 align:start position:0%
zero so
 
03:19:01.250 --> 03:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
in making it more possible for more
 
03:19:03.170 --> 03:19:03.180 align:start position:0%
people to harness more renewable energy
 
03:19:05.389 --> 03:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
the the wonderful thing is that the
 
03:19:05.399 --> 03:19:06.410 align:start position:0%
the the wonderful thing is that the
value

03:19:06.410 --> 03:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
value
 
03:19:08.150 --> 03:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
the additional value doesn't have to
 
03:19:10.370 --> 03:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
come from others it comes from
 
03:19:12.710 --> 03:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
from nature it's free for the taking if
 
03:19:15.349 --> 03:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
we just remove arbitrary limits and we
 
03:19:18.170 --> 03:19:18.180 align:start position:0%
allow again these are private investors
 
03:19:20.570 --> 03:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
to build generation on their own
 
03:19:22.849 --> 03:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
facilities with their own money
 
03:19:22.859 --> 03:19:24.410 align:start position:0%
facilities with their own money
uh

03:19:24.410 --> 03:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:19:26.269 --> 03:19:26.279 align:start position:0%
and they're just harnessing the value
 
03:19:28.429 --> 03:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
that is is available
 
03:19:31.190 --> 03:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
to all of us thanks for allowing okay
 
03:19:32.690 --> 03:19:32.700 align:start position:0%
additional comments representative
 
03:19:35.150 --> 03:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair I would just
 
03:19:38.150 --> 03:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
comment on that uh which was
 
03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
um I think the question was asked in
 
03:19:42.190 --> 03:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
committee here uh
 
03:19:45.230 --> 03:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
there is no regulation that prevents
 
03:19:47.570 --> 03:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
people from putting more solar out there
 
03:19:47.580 --> 03:19:49.010 align:start position:0%
people from putting more solar out there
whatsoever

03:19:49.010 --> 03:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
03:19:49.020 --> 03:19:53.210 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
nothing

03:19:53.210 --> 03:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:55.730 --> 03:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
okay representative merner has a comment
 
03:19:58.070 --> 03:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
yeah we've gone around and around with
 
03:19:59.389 --> 03:19:59.399 align:start position:0%
this last few years and I had two big
 
03:20:00.950 --> 03:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
projects in the North country and it is
 
03:20:03.590 --> 03:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
free to harness and it is but these
 
03:20:05.570 --> 03:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
people will not invest unless we give
 
03:20:07.849 --> 03:20:07.859 align:start position:0%
them the give them the money so they
 
03:20:09.830 --> 03:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
want us to pay for this through you know
 
03:20:13.370 --> 03:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
to increase that one megawatt and I get
 
03:20:15.110 --> 03:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
calls all the time on projects you know
 
03:20:16.250 --> 03:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
they're not going to do it unless they
 
03:20:19.190 --> 03:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
get that increase so they want they want
 
03:20:20.990 --> 03:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
the rate pays to pay for their projects
 
03:20:23.269 --> 03:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
that's and and to subsidize this stuff
 
03:20:26.110 --> 03:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm in total agreement with uh
 
03:20:28.690 --> 03:20:28.700 align:start position:0%
representative president
 
03:20:30.950 --> 03:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative parcel had his end up
 
03:20:30.960 --> 03:20:32.269 align:start position:0%
representative parcel had his end up
first

03:20:32.269 --> 03:20:32.279 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:20:34.309 --> 03:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair I do believe that
 
03:20:38.030 --> 03:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
our uh um consumer Advocate gave
 
03:20:41.090 --> 03:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
testimony that these uh that this will
 
03:20:44.030 --> 03:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
serve as a load reducer and doing as
 
03:20:46.130 --> 03:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
much it has a very strong potential to
 
03:20:48.410 --> 03:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
reduce consumer rates and I'm for all
 
03:20:49.490 --> 03:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
for reducing the rates that our
 
03:20:51.650 --> 03:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
consumers are paying
 
03:20:53.510 --> 03:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative Christian has a comment
 
03:20:56.210 --> 03:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
yeah it's just commenting on um I
 
03:20:57.830 --> 03:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
believe we're referring to cost shifting
 
03:20:59.510 --> 03:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
and I believe that the recent vder
 
03:20:59.520 --> 03:21:00.950 align:start position:0%
and I believe that the recent vder
report

03:21:00.950 --> 03:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
report
 
03:21:03.050 --> 03:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
pretty unequivocally showed that that is
 
03:21:06.170 --> 03:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
not happening so it is not that these
 
03:21:08.030 --> 03:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
projects are are costing money to the
 
03:21:08.040 --> 03:21:09.410 align:start position:0%
projects are are costing money to the
ratepayers

03:21:09.410 --> 03:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
ratepayers
 
03:21:11.330 --> 03:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
we're simply
 
03:21:14.929 --> 03:21:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:17.990 --> 03:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi had us a comment
 
03:21:21.230 --> 03:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
I believe that vdr report said that the
 
03:21:23.990 --> 03:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
amount of cost shifting was
 
03:21:28.670 --> 03:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
not significant at one megawatt but if
 
03:21:31.550 --> 03:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
you raise it to five megawatts
 
03:21:37.070 --> 03:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:40.010 --> 03:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
additional comment may I respond
 
03:21:42.349 --> 03:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
representative Christian I'm considering
 
03:21:43.969 --> 03:21:43.979 align:start position:0%
that that report came out before the
 
03:21:45.889 --> 03:21:45.899 align:start position:0%
most recent spike in natural gas prices
 
03:21:47.330 --> 03:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
I think
 
03:21:49.370 --> 03:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
there's uh
 
03:21:51.650 --> 03:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
impacts on both sides that we can
 
03:21:51.660 --> 03:21:53.090 align:start position:0%
impacts on both sides that we can
consider

03:21:53.090 --> 03:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
consider
 
03:21:56.929 --> 03:21:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:58.790 --> 03:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call

03:22:04.550 --> 03:22:04.560 align:start position:0%

buy about a 10 to 10 the motion to itl
fails

03:22:53.570 --> 03:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
fails
 
03:22:55.610 --> 03:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
and I'll remind all members that if
 
03:22:58.429 --> 03:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
there are no further motions made this
 
03:23:00.050 --> 03:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
bill will go to the floor without
 
03:23:00.060 --> 03:23:01.610 align:start position:0%
bill will go to the floor without
recommendation

03:23:01.610 --> 03:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
03:23:04.010 --> 03:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
having said that I'll ask the question
 
03:23:05.809 --> 03:23:05.819 align:start position:0%
are there any other motions to be made
 
03:23:07.550 --> 03:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
03:23:09.950 --> 03:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams this is just a
 
03:23:09.960 --> 03:23:10.849 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams this is just a
question

03:23:10.849 --> 03:23:10.859 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:23:10.859 --> 03:23:11.630 align:start position:0%
question
um

03:23:11.630 --> 03:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:14.090 --> 03:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
having previously done this where we had
 
03:23:17.990 --> 03:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
to vote itl OTP retain for every bill I
 
03:23:19.250 --> 03:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
understand we're going to send this to
 
03:23:21.050 --> 03:23:21.060 align:start position:0%
the floor without recommendation does
 
03:23:23.210 --> 03:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
that still mean that the default without
 
03:23:25.670 --> 03:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation starts with an OTP I just
 
03:23:28.429 --> 03:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
want to clarify that yes it does that's
 
03:23:31.429 --> 03:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
all I wanted to know okay
 
03:23:33.769 --> 03:23:33.779 align:start position:0%
are there any other motions to be made
 
03:23:36.650 --> 03:23:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:38.750 --> 03:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
03:23:41.809 --> 03:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
will send this bill to the floor without
 
03:23:41.819 --> 03:23:43.550 align:start position:0%
will send this bill to the floor without
recommendation

03:23:43.550 --> 03:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
03:23:49.070 --> 03:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:51.590 --> 03:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
James Summers will write the statement
 
03:23:54.110 --> 03:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
for itl
 
03:23:56.389 --> 03:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
who will write the statement for
 
03:24:02.450 --> 03:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:04.490 --> 03:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
representative partial will write the
 
03:24:08.929 --> 03:24:08.939 align:start position:0%
statement in support of OTP
 
03:24:11.570 --> 03:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
with that we'll close the executive
 
03:24:15.349 --> 03:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 252-523
 
03:24:18.590 --> 03:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
and we'll open an executive session on
 
03:24:21.469 --> 03:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
House Bill 524 the very next bill on the
 
03:24:21.479 --> 03:24:23.150 align:start position:0%
House Bill 524 the very next bill on the
list

03:24:23.150 --> 03:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
list
 
03:24:25.429 --> 03:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
and the chair will recognize Troy murder
 
03:24:26.870 --> 03:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
for a motion
 
03:24:30.229 --> 03:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I move itl on 524
 
03:24:33.710 --> 03:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative closure
 
03:24:35.870 --> 03:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
I will second the motion it's been moved
 
03:24:39.610 --> 03:24:39.620 align:start position:0%
and seconded that we itl House Bill 524
 
03:24:42.469 --> 03:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
relative to Regional greenhouse gas
 
03:24:46.309 --> 03:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:50.870 --> 03:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:52.610 --> 03:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
representative merner did you want to
 
03:24:54.530 --> 03:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
say anything
 
03:24:56.710 --> 03:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
I know that this is going to be
 
03:24:58.550 --> 03:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
seeing the state of what we're paying
 
03:25:00.349 --> 03:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
for energy right now would increase that
 
03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
thing from a dollar to three dollars on
 
03:25:05.870 --> 03:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
the money and it would be an impact of
 
03:25:07.610 --> 03:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
roughly like seven million dollars to
 
03:25:10.250 --> 03:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
the rate payers
 
03:25:13.070 --> 03:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative munz
 
03:25:15.229 --> 03:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:25:15.239 --> 03:25:16.010 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

03:25:16.010 --> 03:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:19.250 --> 03:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
the the impact on rate payers
 
03:25:21.830 --> 03:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
um is would be minimal in terms of the
 
03:25:23.269 --> 03:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
monthly impact
 
03:25:24.830 --> 03:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
um I think we're talking about something
 
03:25:27.349 --> 03:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
between you know a dollar and two
 
03:25:29.210 --> 03:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
dollars at most
 
03:25:32.330 --> 03:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
um and quite frankly the impact of that
 
03:25:37.849 --> 03:25:37.859 align:start position:0%
would um you know not be not be felt if
 
03:25:40.630 --> 03:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
the price of Rex continues to increase
 
03:25:43.849 --> 03:25:43.859 align:start position:0%
as they have been uh we're only talking
 
03:25:46.429 --> 03:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
about a two dollar increase in the
 
03:25:48.469 --> 03:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
amount of money that would go towards
 
03:25:50.290 --> 03:25:50.300 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:25:53.450 --> 03:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund
 
03:25:56.330 --> 03:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
uh so the renewable energy funds
 
03:26:00.349 --> 03:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
the uh the the Energy Efficiency fund
 
03:26:00.359 --> 03:26:01.309 align:start position:0%
the uh the the Energy Efficiency fund
um

03:26:01.309 --> 03:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:03.769 --> 03:26:03.779 align:start position:0%
which is minimal and as I said as the
 
03:26:06.590 --> 03:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
prices go up uh the impact on consumers
 
03:26:07.790 --> 03:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
03:26:10.729 --> 03:26:10.739 align:start position:0%
um they're not going to feel it at all
 
03:26:13.370 --> 03:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a comment
 
03:26:14.929 --> 03:26:14.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:26:16.610 --> 03:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
you know I find it fascinating I was
 
03:26:18.349 --> 03:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
counting up how many bills that had been
 
03:26:20.330 --> 03:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
through this committee that have been in
 
03:26:22.670 --> 03:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
fact even tabled in the last session and
 
03:26:24.530 --> 03:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
then we've been discussed here and every
 
03:26:26.510 --> 03:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
time it's stated that well this will
 
03:26:28.550 --> 03:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
only be one dollar two dollar three
 
03:26:30.590 --> 03:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
dollars per rate payer and then if we
 
03:26:32.210 --> 03:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
actually would take all these and pass
 
03:26:34.969 --> 03:26:34.979 align:start position:0%
all of them including this one that that
 
03:26:36.950 --> 03:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
little bit one dollar two dollar well we
 
03:26:38.450 --> 03:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
expect them to get everybody okay fine
 
03:26:40.370 --> 03:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
you're gonna pay 50 more a month sixty
 
03:26:41.630 --> 03:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
dollars more a month what are we
 
03:26:43.309 --> 03:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
actually looking forward to you get you
 
03:26:44.450 --> 03:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
all keep saying that we're going to
 
03:26:46.550 --> 03:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
raise it a dollar or two but it's going
 
03:26:47.929 --> 03:26:47.939 align:start position:0%
up astronomically especially if we
 
03:26:50.150 --> 03:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
passed all these
 
03:26:52.849 --> 03:26:52.859 align:start position:0%
representative cretian has a comment
 
03:26:54.710 --> 03:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
with respect many of these bills are
 
03:26:56.870 --> 03:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
related to the same single dollar we
 
03:26:58.309 --> 03:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
just kind of keep going around in
 
03:27:00.710 --> 03:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
circles about where it should go
 
03:27:00.720 --> 03:27:01.729 align:start position:0%
circles about where it should go
um

03:27:01.729 --> 03:27:01.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:04.849 --> 03:27:04.859 align:start position:0%
I obviously was in favor of the similar
 
03:27:06.410 --> 03:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
Bill where we would send all of the
 
03:27:08.210 --> 03:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
Reggie money back to where it belongs in
 
03:27:08.220 --> 03:27:09.410 align:start position:0%
Reggie money back to where it belongs in
Reggie

03:27:09.410 --> 03:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
Reggie
 
03:27:11.330 --> 03:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
um I think this would be a compromise
 
03:27:13.969 --> 03:27:13.979 align:start position:0%
step to send a bit more of it closer to
 
03:27:15.950 --> 03:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
what was originally there
 
03:27:17.090 --> 03:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
um if we're really concerned about
 
03:27:18.710 --> 03:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
reducing rates I think we have other
 
03:27:20.510 --> 03:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
means to do that like the bill that we
 
03:27:22.849 --> 03:27:22.859 align:start position:0%
did at the end of last session where we
 
03:27:24.889 --> 03:27:24.899 align:start position:0%
were literally giving the money but
 
03:27:26.870 --> 03:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
Reggie money is meant for Energy
 
03:27:28.250 --> 03:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
Efficiency it should go to Energy
 
03:27:30.650 --> 03:27:30.660 align:start position:0%
Efficiency thank you representative
 
03:27:33.110 --> 03:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
Bernardi has a comment thank you Mr
 
03:27:35.630 --> 03:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
chair well I'm also in favor of selling
 
03:27:37.370 --> 03:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
sending all the Reggie money back to
 
03:27:38.990 --> 03:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
where it belongs and I think it belongs
 
03:27:42.070 --> 03:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
in the hands of the ratepayers all of it
 
03:27:46.610 --> 03:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
what we keep hearing is uh you know a
 
03:27:49.070 --> 03:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
nickel here a dollar here a dollar there
 
03:27:51.590 --> 03:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
it reminds me of like Everett Dirksen
 
03:27:53.389 --> 03:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
when he stood up in the house floor and
 
03:27:53.399 --> 03:27:54.530 align:start position:0%
when he stood up in the house floor and
said

03:27:54.530 --> 03:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:27:56.750 --> 03:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
said pretty soon you're talking about
 
03:28:00.170 --> 03:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
real money you know it just it's
 
03:28:03.769 --> 03:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
unbelievable that we want to raise rates
 
03:28:05.870 --> 03:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
on rate payers and I don't care if it's
 
03:28:08.269 --> 03:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
10 cents or ten dollars it's
 
03:28:12.250 --> 03:28:12.260 align:start position:0%
inappropriate at this time period
 
03:28:14.690 --> 03:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
03:28:19.610 --> 03:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:22.550 --> 03:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
just um we're in discussion um that
 
03:28:24.349 --> 03:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
eloquent speech that we just heard about
 
03:28:26.570 --> 03:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
not raising any rates but yet we just
 
03:28:28.550 --> 03:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
voted on a bill to fund a study
 
03:28:29.990 --> 03:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee for twenty five thousand
 
03:28:33.050 --> 03:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
dollars so that seems to be a little bit
 
03:28:34.910 --> 03:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
of confusion about that
 
03:28:38.150 --> 03:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
um this was a bill the other day but
 
03:28:39.889 --> 03:28:39.899 align:start position:0%
originally this bill was supposed to be
 
03:28:42.050 --> 03:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
in law it was supposed to be six dollars
 
03:28:44.570 --> 03:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
from Reggie was supposed to be used and
 
03:28:46.790 --> 03:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
this bill asks for three dollars which
 
03:28:48.950 --> 03:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
is a very conservative approach to bring
 
03:28:51.650 --> 03:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
the action into compliance with what was
 
03:28:56.389 --> 03:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:58.130 --> 03:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
thank you additional comments
 
03:29:01.729 --> 03:29:01.739 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds at his hand up
 
03:29:01.739 --> 03:29:03.170 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds at his hand up
yes

03:29:03.170 --> 03:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:29:07.010 --> 03:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
um yes notwithstanding the rhetorical
 
03:29:09.110 --> 03:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
flourish from both representative
 
03:29:10.790 --> 03:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
Summers and representative Bernardi
 
03:29:14.090 --> 03:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
about us seemingly talking about adding
 
03:29:16.550 --> 03:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
more and more money or taking more and
 
03:29:19.130 --> 03:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
more money from rate payers we we have
 
03:29:20.870 --> 03:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
been having the same debate over and
 
03:29:23.469 --> 03:29:23.479 align:start position:0%
over in this committee about really two
 
03:29:25.790 --> 03:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
funds which are the Energy Efficiency
 
03:29:28.250 --> 03:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
fund and the renewable energy fund and
 
03:29:30.290 --> 03:29:30.300 align:start position:0%
both of those funds of course are funded
 
03:29:34.370 --> 03:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
by these small charges that have been on
 
03:29:36.349 --> 03:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
a part of New Hampshire's energy policy
 
03:29:40.849 --> 03:29:40.859 align:start position:0%
for over a decade and both are intended
 
03:29:43.490 --> 03:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
to reduce to fund investments in
 
03:29:45.349 --> 03:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
renewable energy and Energy Efficiency
 
03:29:48.830 --> 03:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
that reduce customers bills and reduce
 
03:29:52.250 --> 03:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
our dependence and exposure uh to fossil
 
03:29:52.260 --> 03:29:54.710 align:start position:0%
our dependence and exposure uh to fossil
fuels

03:29:54.710 --> 03:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:56.809 --> 03:29:56.819 align:start position:0%
I know that all of everyone on this
 
03:29:58.070 --> 03:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
committee is hearing from their
 
03:29:59.690 --> 03:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
constituents about their high energy
 
03:30:02.750 --> 03:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
bills one of the first things out of all
 
03:30:04.370 --> 03:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
of our mouths when we're talking to our
 
03:30:06.650 --> 03:30:06.660 align:start position:0%
constituents ought to be
 
03:30:09.469 --> 03:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
03:30:11.389 --> 03:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
the energy costs come from the global
 
03:30:12.950 --> 03:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel Market there's not much we
 
03:30:14.330 --> 03:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
can do about that but one of the things
 
03:30:16.070 --> 03:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
one of the first things you should do is
 
03:30:17.809 --> 03:30:17.819 align:start position:0%
access the New Hampshire saves program
 
03:30:17.819 --> 03:30:19.550 align:start position:0%
access the New Hampshire saves program
and

03:30:19.550 --> 03:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:30:22.070 --> 03:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
find ways and get financial assistance
 
03:30:24.110 --> 03:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
in reducing your energy use and that
 
03:30:26.809 --> 03:30:26.819 align:start position:0%
will reduce your energy bill people pay
 
03:30:30.110 --> 03:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
bills they don't pay rates so you know
 
03:30:32.090 --> 03:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
we I had a side conversation with
 
03:30:33.469 --> 03:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas where he told me
 
03:30:34.969 --> 03:30:34.979 align:start position:0%
that he'd referred one of his
 
03:30:36.769 --> 03:30:36.779 align:start position:0%
constituents to the New Hampshire safes
 
03:30:38.090 --> 03:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
programs and I thought that was great
 
03:30:39.530 --> 03:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
and that's what we all should be doing
 
03:30:41.809 --> 03:30:41.819 align:start position:0%
but when we underfund these programs
 
03:30:44.090 --> 03:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
like we're doing with this one dollar of
 
03:30:46.070 --> 03:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
the Reggie allowance money going to the
 
03:30:48.590 --> 03:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency fund the program is
 
03:30:50.809 --> 03:30:50.819 align:start position:0%
start for funds and when people reach
 
03:30:53.990 --> 03:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
out and call it they are regularly told
 
03:30:56.210 --> 03:30:56.220 align:start position:0%
oh the program's out of money for this
 
03:30:58.370 --> 03:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
year you'll you'll have to you know we
 
03:31:00.110 --> 03:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
can take your application now but you
 
03:31:00.120 --> 03:31:00.889 align:start position:0%
can take your application now but you
won't

03:31:00.889 --> 03:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
won't
 
03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
um you won't be able to access anything
 
03:31:04.550 --> 03:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
for you know six months or nine months
 
03:31:06.590 --> 03:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
so we shouldn't have that happening
 
03:31:08.690 --> 03:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
especially in this environment we should
 
03:31:10.690 --> 03:31:10.700 align:start position:0%
be funding the Energy Efficiency program
 
03:31:13.010 --> 03:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
you know with a relatively meager
 
03:31:15.410 --> 03:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
portion of the Reggie allowance money as
 
03:31:18.110 --> 03:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
we've heard and and then referring all
 
03:31:23.210 --> 03:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:25.070 --> 03:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire saves program is
 
03:31:28.130 --> 03:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
hardly starved for funds its funds have
 
03:31:30.889 --> 03:31:30.899 align:start position:0%
increased from 32 million to 73 million
 
03:31:34.250 --> 03:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
since 2017. representative Doug Thomas
 
03:31:37.130 --> 03:31:37.140 align:start position:0%
has a comment uh thank you Mr chair um
 
03:31:40.309 --> 03:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:41.990 --> 03:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
everything that everyone has said here
 
03:31:45.410 --> 03:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
so far is true in their own way
 
03:31:47.150 --> 03:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
um but I think more about the times
 
03:31:49.490 --> 03:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
we're in right now and if you look at
 
03:31:52.130 --> 03:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
all the money that Massachusetts has
 
03:31:52.140 --> 03:31:53.210 align:start position:0%
all the money that Massachusetts has
thrown

03:31:53.210 --> 03:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
thrown
 
03:31:53.220 --> 03:31:54.769 align:start position:0%
thrown
against

03:31:54.769 --> 03:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
against
 
03:31:54.779 --> 03:31:55.670 align:start position:0%
against
um

03:31:55.670 --> 03:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:58.070 --> 03:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
their efforts to raise renewable energy
 
03:32:01.010 --> 03:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
and you look at their rates their rates
 
03:32:02.570 --> 03:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
they may be close to ours but they're
 
03:32:03.830 --> 03:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
still a little bit higher so they really
 
03:32:06.469 --> 03:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
haven't gained much ground in in that
 
03:32:08.510 --> 03:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
but what I'm looking at right now and I
 
03:32:09.950 --> 03:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
thought about this bill I thought about
 
03:32:12.170 --> 03:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
the fact that maybe it's you know with
 
03:32:14.630 --> 03:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
things where they are that there could
 
03:32:15.950 --> 03:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
be some movement here but then I look
 
03:32:18.469 --> 03:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
around and see where we are right now
 
03:32:20.389 --> 03:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
with the high energy prices the high
 
03:32:23.809 --> 03:32:23.819 align:start position:0%
electricity prices and I said this is
 
03:32:26.809 --> 03:32:26.819 align:start position:0%
not the time to make this move it just
 
03:32:26.819 --> 03:32:28.010 align:start position:0%
not the time to make this move it just
isn't

03:32:28.010 --> 03:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
um we can talk about what it can do five
 
03:32:31.849 --> 03:32:31.859 align:start position:0%
years from now but I think people want
 
03:32:34.010 --> 03:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
to see what things can be done right now
 
03:32:37.790 --> 03:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
for them so I can't support this bill I
 
03:32:41.150 --> 03:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
have to support the itel and spill
 
03:32:43.429 --> 03:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a comment
 
03:32:45.710 --> 03:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm looking over
 
03:32:48.290 --> 03:32:48.300 align:start position:0%
my notes from during testimony and when
 
03:32:51.769 --> 03:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
Mr Fontaine from Des was here uh he
 
03:32:54.950 --> 03:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
pointed out that the savings from Energy
 
03:32:58.550 --> 03:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
Efficiency do reduce demand and in
 
03:33:00.229 --> 03:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
particular transmission costs because
 
03:33:02.690 --> 03:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
that's that much less energy that
 
03:33:04.490 --> 03:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
actually needs to be transmitted so
 
03:33:06.710 --> 03:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
there are some savings that get spread
 
03:33:08.530 --> 03:33:08.540 align:start position:0%
throughout the whole system
 
03:33:11.809 --> 03:33:11.819 align:start position:0%
John Mann also talked about the
 
03:33:14.269 --> 03:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
multiplier effect how how the savings
 
03:33:17.030 --> 03:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
from Energy Efficiency goes back into
 
03:33:19.670 --> 03:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
the economy so there are some some
 
03:33:20.929 --> 03:33:20.939 align:start position:0%
impacts here that are you know
 
03:33:23.389 --> 03:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
definitely positive impacts that that I
 
03:33:26.510 --> 03:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
think we should be considering
 
03:33:29.570 --> 03:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
additional comments
 
03:33:32.870 --> 03:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair
 
03:33:37.309 --> 03:33:37.319 align:start position:0%
we've had some of these policies such as
 
03:33:40.070 --> 03:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
dredgy Energy Efficiency programs going
 
03:33:43.849 --> 03:33:43.859 align:start position:0%
back to 2008 and the moment from the
 
03:33:45.889 --> 03:33:45.899 align:start position:0%
moment they were conceived they're
 
03:33:49.250 --> 03:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
immediately crippled uh by
 
03:33:49.260 --> 03:33:50.929 align:start position:0%
immediately crippled uh by
and

03:33:50.929 --> 03:33:50.939 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:52.969 --> 03:33:52.979 align:start position:0%
and money was siphoned off in ways that
 
03:33:55.190 --> 03:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
the original bill was that intended many
 
03:33:57.110 --> 03:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
of my constituents know that if we had
 
03:33:59.150 --> 03:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
invested back in those days in some of
 
03:34:00.889 --> 03:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
these programs we would not be in the
 
03:34:02.929 --> 03:34:02.939 align:start position:0%
state we are in today and most of my
 
03:34:04.429 --> 03:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
constituents from speaking with them I
 
03:34:05.690 --> 03:34:05.700 align:start position:0%
know they're happy for the few putties
 
03:34:07.969 --> 03:34:07.979 align:start position:0%
paying the bill under the belief we're
 
03:34:09.229 --> 03:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
going to be able to eventually get out
 
03:34:12.290 --> 03:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
of the thumb of fossil fuels and as far
 
03:34:14.150 --> 03:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
as Massachusetts and their investment in
 
03:34:16.849 --> 03:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
renewable energies Massachusetts does
 
03:34:18.170 --> 03:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
not set their only rates any more than
 
03:34:19.790 --> 03:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or Vermont do
 
03:34:22.190 --> 03:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
is Old New England sets the rates and in
 
03:34:25.910 --> 03:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
fact uh if rates are inflated because of
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
natural gas prices
 
03:34:30.170 --> 03:34:30.180 align:start position:0%
it's States like Massachusetts and
 
03:34:33.710 --> 03:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
Vermont will and who have initiated very
 
03:34:35.510 --> 03:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
aggressive renewable energy policies
 
03:34:37.490 --> 03:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
that end up paying for it more than we
 
03:34:39.290 --> 03:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
do and
 
03:34:42.349 --> 03:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
I just think that's really not
 
03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
ah now
 
03:34:46.550 --> 03:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's just not right okay thank you
 
03:34:48.349 --> 03:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
representative mun says
 
03:34:50.510 --> 03:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I first want to
 
03:34:52.309 --> 03:34:52.319 align:start position:0%
apologize to the committee for mixing up
 
03:34:54.349 --> 03:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits and Reggie
 
03:34:54.359 --> 03:34:55.849 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits and Reggie
allowances

03:34:55.849 --> 03:34:55.859 align:start position:0%
allowances
 
03:34:57.349 --> 03:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about Reggie allowances
 
03:35:00.650 --> 03:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
here and I I apologize for that and and
 
03:35:02.870 --> 03:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
to representative Summers point I mean
 
03:35:05.150 --> 03:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
we have been throwing around numbers
 
03:35:06.889 --> 03:35:06.899 align:start position:0%
um you know quite a bit
 
03:35:09.950 --> 03:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
um but as somebody said earlier those
 
03:35:11.870 --> 03:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
numbers are not additive and it's
 
03:35:13.729 --> 03:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
important to keep in keep in mind the
 
03:35:15.130 --> 03:35:15.140 align:start position:0%
context of what we're talking about
 
03:35:17.870 --> 03:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
based on the number based on the fact
 
03:35:21.229 --> 03:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
that this would divert or or this would
 
03:35:25.670 --> 03:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
restore about 6.5 million dollars uh in
 
03:35:29.030 --> 03:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
funds to efficiency efforts and based on
 
03:35:30.590 --> 03:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that we were we've been told in
 
03:35:32.210 --> 03:35:32.220 align:start position:0%
previous testimony that there are about
 
03:35:35.990 --> 03:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
757 000 customers in New in New
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is equivalent to about 83
 
03:35:40.550 --> 03:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
cents a month
 
03:35:43.429 --> 03:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
for every customer and I think if you
 
03:35:45.950 --> 03:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
ask anybody you know are you willing to
 
03:35:48.950 --> 03:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
make an investment of 83 cents a month
 
03:35:51.950 --> 03:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
with the idea that this will hope this
 
03:35:55.150 --> 03:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
will help reduce demand and and and
 
03:35:58.729 --> 03:35:58.739 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of renewable energy
 
03:36:02.690 --> 03:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
so that we're not as reliant on fossil
 
03:36:04.910 --> 03:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
fuels particularly natural gas which is
 
03:36:06.710 --> 03:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
at a premium now in the worldwide Market
 
03:36:08.809 --> 03:36:08.819 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's anybody in the
 
03:36:10.370 --> 03:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
state that wouldn't say they they would
 
03:36:13.969 --> 03:36:13.979 align:start position:0%
make that small investment of 83 cents
 
03:36:13.979 --> 03:36:15.550 align:start position:0%
make that small investment of 83 cents
foreign

03:36:15.550 --> 03:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:36:18.650 --> 03:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
excuse me additional comments
 
03:36:20.990 --> 03:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative Summers just a quick one
 
03:36:23.269 --> 03:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
just to remind everybody that in when I
 
03:36:26.269 --> 03:36:26.279 align:start position:0%
was here in 2010 on this very committee
 
03:36:28.010 --> 03:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
um it was actually that crippling that
 
03:36:29.750 --> 03:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
was actually written by the Senate to
 
03:36:32.809 --> 03:36:32.819 align:start position:0%
save Reggie that in 2010 we actually
 
03:36:35.450 --> 03:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
voted in this committee and in the house
 
03:36:38.210 --> 03:36:38.220 align:start position:0%
to repeal Reggie altogether and the
 
03:36:41.389 --> 03:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
Senate actually end up um
 
03:36:43.910 --> 03:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
defeating that by actually setting it to
 
03:36:45.710 --> 03:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
the one dollar standard if I remember
 
03:36:45.720 --> 03:36:47.150 align:start position:0%
the one dollar standard if I remember
correctly

03:36:47.150 --> 03:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
03:36:49.370 --> 03:36:49.380 align:start position:0%

motion to itl House Bill 524 failed
 
03:37:57.229 --> 03:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
and I would ask the committee if there
 
03:38:05.210 --> 03:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:06.950 --> 03:38:06.960 align:start position:0%

floor without recommendation
 
03:38:15.410 --> 03:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
representative Troy murder will write
 
03:38:17.450 --> 03:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
the statement
 
03:38:19.729 --> 03:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
in support of itl who will write the
 
03:38:22.429 --> 03:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
statement in support of
 
03:38:30.650 --> 03:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:32.510 --> 03:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
so with that we'll close the public
 
03:38:36.229 --> 03:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 524 we have two to
 
03:38:39.530 --> 03:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:43.729 --> 03:38:43.739 align:start position:0%

03:38:53.269 --> 03:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
oh I didn't check one off here oh I'm
 
03:38:55.250 --> 03:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
sorry all right we're we are I was
 
03:38:58.250 --> 03:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
correct we have two bills left to go the
 
03:39:02.769 --> 03:39:02.779 align:start position:0%
next one up is House Bill 631 Dash FN
 
03:39:05.630 --> 03:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
relative to electric utility smart meter
 
03:39:08.570 --> 03:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
Gateway devices and I recognize
 
03:39:10.610 --> 03:39:10.620 align:start position:0%

I will suck that it's been moved and
 
03:39:27.229 --> 03:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
seconded that we itl House Bill 631 FN
 
03:39:29.690 --> 03:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
discussion from the committee
 
03:39:32.389 --> 03:39:32.399 align:start position:0%
representative Summers uh yes Mr
 
03:39:34.130 --> 03:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
chairman I was uh
 
03:39:35.990 --> 03:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
actually I'm an itl this bill and the
 
03:39:37.309 --> 03:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
only reason why you all have heard of me
 
03:39:39.469 --> 03:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
complaining about increasing rates to
 
03:39:42.290 --> 03:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
rate payers or the cost of their bill to
 
03:39:44.990 --> 03:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
the ratepayers and uh with this one it
 
03:39:48.769 --> 03:39:48.779 align:start position:0%
was testimony by not only eversource
 
03:39:50.510 --> 03:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
and then with the second by the
 
03:39:52.610 --> 03:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
department of energy that in fact that
 
03:39:52.620 --> 03:39:53.570 align:start position:0%
department of energy that in fact that
that

03:39:53.570 --> 03:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:39:57.530 --> 03:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
um the utilities would have to provide
 
03:40:01.190 --> 03:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
um different models of metering as far
 
03:40:02.349 --> 03:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
as actually
 
03:40:05.030 --> 03:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
inventory which would increase inventory
 
03:40:08.450 --> 03:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
costs and the inventory value and that
 
03:40:11.269 --> 03:40:11.279 align:start position:0%
that actual inventory would be passed on
 
03:40:14.809 --> 03:40:14.819 align:start position:0%
to the rate payers therefore my TL
 
03:40:17.809 --> 03:40:17.819 align:start position:0%
further discussion on this uh proposed
 
03:40:20.090 --> 03:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
legislation representative mines
 
03:40:22.130 --> 03:40:22.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:40:24.410 --> 03:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
um I've been struggling with this and
 
03:40:26.750 --> 03:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
and it's kind of a Chicken and the Egg
 
03:40:26.760 --> 03:40:28.370 align:start position:0%
and it's kind of a Chicken and the Egg
problem

03:40:28.370 --> 03:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:40:30.190 --> 03:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:40:33.670 --> 03:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
utilities can't offer consumers
 
03:40:37.130 --> 03:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
opportunities to save money by
 
03:40:37.140 --> 03:40:37.910 align:start position:0%
opportunities to save money by
um

03:40:37.910 --> 03:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:40.250 --> 03:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
deciding when to
 
03:40:40.260 --> 03:40:40.849 align:start position:0%
deciding when to
um

03:40:40.849 --> 03:40:40.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:43.429 --> 03:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
you know use power they can't offer time
 
03:40:47.809 --> 03:40:47.819 align:start position:0%
of use rates without Smart Meters
 
03:40:49.790 --> 03:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
um but
 
03:40:51.950 --> 03:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
um without
 
03:40:54.349 --> 03:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
um without the consumers paying for it
 
03:40:56.210 --> 03:40:56.220 align:start position:0%
you can't have you can't have the smart
 
03:40:58.070 --> 03:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
meters and and you know I don't know how
 
03:41:00.410 --> 03:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
many consumers are going to be willing
 
03:41:04.330 --> 03:41:04.340 align:start position:0%
to pay to Shell out 250 dollars
 
03:41:08.630 --> 03:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
and it also limits the the the fact that
 
03:41:11.330 --> 03:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
um the majority of households in the
 
03:41:14.269 --> 03:41:14.279 align:start position:0%
state do not have these devices limits
 
03:41:17.269 --> 03:41:17.279 align:start position:0%
what utilities can do in in terms of
 
03:41:19.849 --> 03:41:19.859 align:start position:0%
innovative other ways to control Power
 
03:41:23.349 --> 03:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
the whole area of transactive energy
 
03:41:23.359 --> 03:41:25.010 align:start position:0%
the whole area of transactive energy
and

03:41:25.010 --> 03:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:26.990 --> 03:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
so I've been trying to figure out is
 
03:41:28.910 --> 03:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
there a way that we can you know somehow
 
03:41:31.190 --> 03:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
get these meters in the hands of people
 
03:41:31.200 --> 03:41:33.229 align:start position:0%
get these meters in the hands of people
without

03:41:33.229 --> 03:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
without
 
03:41:33.239 --> 03:41:33.889 align:start position:0%
without
um

03:41:33.889 --> 03:41:33.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:35.870 --> 03:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
the individuals having to incur a
 
03:41:38.570 --> 03:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
significant impact I did some research
 
03:41:40.610 --> 03:41:40.620 align:start position:0%
and I've had some preliminary
 
03:41:42.050 --> 03:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
conversations with the Department of
 
03:41:44.090 --> 03:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
energy that there does appear to be some
 
03:41:44.100 --> 03:41:45.729 align:start position:0%
energy that there does appear to be some
federal

03:41:45.729 --> 03:41:45.739 align:start position:0%
federal
 
03:41:49.450 --> 03:41:49.460 align:start position:0%
programs that would allow
 
03:41:52.309 --> 03:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
utilities to pay for these me that would
 
03:41:55.969 --> 03:41:55.979 align:start position:0%
fund utilities paying for these meters
 
03:41:58.550 --> 03:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a grant process that they
 
03:42:00.410 --> 03:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
have to go through and I'm just
 
03:42:02.090 --> 03:42:02.100 align:start position:0%
wondering if there isn't a way that we
 
03:42:03.950 --> 03:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't spend a couple spend a little
 
03:42:06.849 --> 03:42:06.859 align:start position:0%
bit of time here
 
03:42:09.410 --> 03:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
recessing this this bill for a couple
 
03:42:11.090 --> 03:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
weeks and just see if we can craft
 
03:42:12.830 --> 03:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
something that would make some sense
 
03:42:16.309 --> 03:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
that would get smart meters uh installed
 
03:42:17.870 --> 03:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
in our state so we can begin moving
 
03:42:19.490 --> 03:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
forward with some of these cost saving
 
03:42:19.500 --> 03:42:23.269 align:start position:0%
forward with some of these cost saving
opportunities

03:42:23.269 --> 03:42:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:25.969 --> 03:42:25.979 align:start position:0%
representative barajny is recognized
 
03:42:27.650 --> 03:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
03:42:29.750 --> 03:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
um so my understanding is that this bill
 
03:42:31.790 --> 03:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
is specifically for smart meter Gateway
 
03:42:34.670 --> 03:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
devices and not just smart meters and if
 
03:42:36.830 --> 03:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
I remember when um the representative
 
03:42:40.130 --> 03:42:40.140 align:start position:0%
from eversource Justified he said that
 
03:42:42.110 --> 03:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
um an example of a Gateway device is
 
03:42:45.349 --> 03:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
just an appliance that knows based on
 
03:42:47.510 --> 03:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
other factors whether it should decrease
 
03:42:49.910 --> 03:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
or increase consumption such as a
 
03:42:53.210 --> 03:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
thermostat for example and people can
 
03:42:55.370 --> 03:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
buy a smart thermostat today that will
 
03:42:57.590 --> 03:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease based on what time
 
03:43:00.590 --> 03:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
of day and similar things so I think if
 
03:43:02.210 --> 03:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
we're talking about Smart Meters that
 
03:43:03.889 --> 03:43:03.899 align:start position:0%
that's probably a different build than
 
03:43:07.490 --> 03:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:09.590 --> 03:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
03:43:13.190 --> 03:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a comment
 
03:43:16.150 --> 03:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so
 
03:43:20.750 --> 03:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh Mr locata from eversource sent me an
 
03:43:23.269 --> 03:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
email I don't know if you all got the
 
03:43:26.870 --> 03:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
same email but he answered some of the
 
03:43:28.490 --> 03:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
questions that
 
03:43:32.389 --> 03:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
he seemed to not have full answers to
 
03:43:35.410 --> 03:43:35.420 align:start position:0%
during the hearing and one of them was
 
03:43:40.130 --> 03:43:40.140 align:start position:0%
uh whether AMR and Ami meters have the
 
03:43:44.349 --> 03:43:44.359 align:start position:0%
capability of of uh doing time of day
 
03:43:49.010 --> 03:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
rates both do the differences Ami meters
 
03:43:52.490 --> 03:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
have much greater granularity the AMR
 
03:43:57.469 --> 03:43:57.479 align:start position:0%
meter is more of a yes or no type uh
 
03:43:57.479 --> 03:43:58.450 align:start position:0%
meter is more of a yes or no type uh
meter

03:43:58.450 --> 03:43:58.460 align:start position:0%
meter
 
03:44:01.250 --> 03:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
and then with respect to where ever
 
03:44:04.070 --> 03:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
source is in Connecticut they are in
 
03:44:07.190 --> 03:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
front of the puc to move forward with
 
03:44:08.950 --> 03:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
the plan to
 
03:44:11.990 --> 03:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
put Ami meters throughout the state of
 
03:44:12.000 --> 03:44:14.210 align:start position:0%
put Ami meters throughout the state of
Connecticut

03:44:14.210 --> 03:44:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:17.150 --> 03:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative Krishan has a comment
 
03:44:19.190 --> 03:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
03:44:21.110 --> 03:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
um so as the prime sponsor of the bill I
 
03:44:25.070 --> 03:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
yes my intention was to ask for AMI
 
03:44:27.050 --> 03:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
devices to be offered for a purchase not
 
03:44:29.870 --> 03:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
that we want a resource or any utility
 
03:44:31.969 --> 03:44:31.979 align:start position:0%
to necessarily be providing them for
 
03:44:34.309 --> 03:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
free I thought that that was a good
 
03:44:36.710 --> 03:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
compromise we did hear testimony that
 
03:44:38.690 --> 03:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
some of our other utilities already have
 
03:44:42.290 --> 03:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
quite a few customers on Ami devices I
 
03:44:43.670 --> 03:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
think that it would be nice for
 
03:44:45.530 --> 03:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
eversource customers to also have that
 
03:44:45.540 --> 03:44:46.790 align:start position:0%
eversource customers to also have that
option

03:44:46.790 --> 03:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
option
 
03:44:49.190 --> 03:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
um but yes I agree with representative
 
03:44:51.229 --> 03:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
ones that perhaps this bill needs a
 
03:44:52.910 --> 03:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
little bit more work to to be finally
 
03:44:54.590 --> 03:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
ready and I would
 
03:44:58.309 --> 03:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
ask uh for your professional courtesy
 
03:45:01.010 --> 03:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
and retaining the Bill thank you
 
03:45:06.889 --> 03:45:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:09.050 --> 03:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
03:45:10.910 --> 03:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
the role in the question of itl for
 
03:45:14.750 --> 03:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:16.670 --> 03:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas
 
03:45:16.680 --> 03:45:17.990 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas
yes

03:45:17.990 --> 03:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:45:20.330 --> 03:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
Janine knotter yes
 
03:45:24.650 --> 03:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
Larry gagne yes try Marner yes
 
03:45:29.090 --> 03:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
Charlie Melvin yes Lex barajny yes JD
 
03:45:32.269 --> 03:45:32.279 align:start position:0%
Bernardi yes Tom pleasure yes James
 
03:45:37.010 --> 03:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
Summers yes Rebecca McWilliams no
 
03:45:40.269 --> 03:45:40.279 align:start position:0%
Rosemary wrong no Jackie creation no
 
03:45:42.889 --> 03:45:42.899 align:start position:0%
lucious partial no
 
03:45:47.990 --> 03:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
Linda Ryan no Chris muns no Henry Noel
 
03:45:53.389 --> 03:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
no Wendy Thomas no Thomas Corman
 
03:45:56.990 --> 03:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
no Ned Reynolds no
 
03:45:58.969 --> 03:45:58.979 align:start position:0%
chair of those yes
 
03:46:02.030 --> 03:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
10 10. so by a vote of 10 to 10 the
 
03:46:05.990 --> 03:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
motion to itl House Bill 631 fails will
 
03:46:08.210 --> 03:46:08.220 align:start position:0%
there be an alternative motion
 
03:46:10.309 --> 03:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
03:46:12.650 --> 03:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair I move that we retain House
 
03:46:15.229 --> 03:46:15.239 align:start position:0%
Bill 631 and I believe I have a second
 
03:46:17.330 --> 03:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
over there yes I would second that
 
03:46:19.729 --> 03:46:19.739 align:start position:0%
motion it's been moved and seconded that
 
03:46:21.650 --> 03:46:21.660 align:start position:0%
we retain house bill
 
03:46:25.670 --> 03:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
631 Is there further discussion
 
03:46:28.190 --> 03:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
03:46:29.690 --> 03:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
yes we definitely need good
 
03:46:31.309 --> 03:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
modernization in order to take advantage
 
03:46:34.309 --> 03:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
of such things as a time a day usage uh
 
03:46:37.010 --> 03:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
smart meter would allow that uh if
 
03:46:38.150 --> 03:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
there's potential money that could be
 
03:46:40.130 --> 03:46:40.140 align:start position:0%
gained by retaining this bill and other
 
03:46:42.590 --> 03:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
sources of that I think that the Suri
 
03:46:45.469 --> 03:46:45.479 align:start position:0%
push on this the lower we can reduce our
 
03:46:47.690 --> 03:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
Peak demands and the sooner we can offer
 
03:46:51.110 --> 03:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
some real rate relief to our customers
 
03:46:54.950 --> 03:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
our constituents for the discussion on
 
03:46:56.750 --> 03:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
the motion to retain representative
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
Corman has it thank you Mr chairman
 
03:47:02.690 --> 03:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
one other aspect of time of use that we
 
03:47:04.729 --> 03:47:04.739 align:start position:0%
really need to be thinking about is that
 
03:47:06.349 --> 03:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to be seeing more and more
 
03:47:08.870 --> 03:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
people wanting to charge their EVS at
 
03:47:11.750 --> 03:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
home as EV sales increase and this is
 
03:47:13.550 --> 03:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
regardless of how any of us feel about
 
03:47:16.250 --> 03:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
EVS what counts as how the chairman of
 
03:47:19.309 --> 03:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
the board of GM and Ford and Volkswagen
 
03:47:21.710 --> 03:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
and those companies feel about EVS EVS
 
03:47:23.809 --> 03:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
are coming and people are going to want
 
03:47:25.370 --> 03:47:25.380 align:start position:0%
to charge them they're going to be
 
03:47:27.469 --> 03:47:27.479 align:start position:0%
wanting to charge them at times when the
 
03:47:29.809 --> 03:47:29.819 align:start position:0%
rates are lower so that is going to be a
 
03:47:31.550 --> 03:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
way that we can actually lower rates in
 
03:47:34.670 --> 03:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
a significant way as people are using
 
03:47:37.309 --> 03:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
larger amounts of power
 
03:47:38.929 --> 03:47:38.939 align:start position:0%
it would be great if they could do it at
 
03:47:42.530 --> 03:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:44.269 --> 03:47:44.279 align:start position:0%
representative Christian has another
 
03:47:46.729 --> 03:47:46.739 align:start position:0%
comment thank you um yes just one other
 
03:47:49.250 --> 03:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
comment um in response to I guess the
 
03:47:51.050 --> 03:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
assertion that needing to offer these
 
03:47:53.990 --> 03:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
would force a resource to increase its
 
03:47:54.000 --> 03:47:54.950 align:start position:0%
would force a resource to increase its
rates

03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
rates
 
03:47:56.269 --> 03:47:56.279 align:start position:0%
um just want to comment that that's
 
03:47:57.710 --> 03:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
always a choice that they make they
 
03:47:59.870 --> 03:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
could choose to take it out of CEO
 
03:48:02.450 --> 03:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
compensation or perhaps something else
 
03:48:05.570 --> 03:48:05.580 align:start position:0%
we're not making them increase their
 
03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:17.330 --> 03:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:19.969 --> 03:48:19.979 align:start position:0%
I'll make a comment here in that I think
 
03:48:19.979 --> 03:48:21.769 align:start position:0%
I'll make a comment here in that I think
that

03:48:21.769 --> 03:48:21.779 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:48:24.710 --> 03:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
we've we've already decided today to
 
03:48:27.469 --> 03:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
retain 7 out of the 12 bills that we're
 
03:48:27.479 --> 03:48:28.670 align:start position:0%
retain 7 out of the 12 bills that we're
hearing

03:48:28.670 --> 03:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:48:31.010 --> 03:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
if we decide to retain this bill that'll
 
03:48:33.769 --> 03:48:33.779 align:start position:0%
be eight out of 12 that's two-thirds of
 
03:48:36.050 --> 03:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
the bills that we've heard today we've
 
03:48:36.060 --> 03:48:37.610 align:start position:0%
the bills that we've heard today we've
retained

03:48:37.610 --> 03:48:37.620 align:start position:0%
retained
 
03:48:39.710 --> 03:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
we had 40 bills in committee this year
 
03:48:42.170 --> 03:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
if we retain two-thirds of them that'll
 
03:48:45.050 --> 03:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
leave us with 30 bills to deal with this
 
03:48:45.060 --> 03:48:47.030 align:start position:0%
leave us with 30 bills to deal with this
fall

03:48:47.030 --> 03:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
fall
 
03:48:49.490 --> 03:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
I think maybe we have we ought to
 
03:48:51.469 --> 03:48:51.479 align:start position:0%
seriously rethink
 
03:48:53.750 --> 03:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
whether we're doing the right thing here
 
03:48:56.630 --> 03:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
by retaining these bills I don't see a
 
03:49:01.070 --> 03:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:03.410 --> 03:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
there are too many obstacles in the way
 
03:49:05.210 --> 03:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
for this to become successful
 
03:49:08.090 --> 03:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
legislation the way I see it
 
03:49:10.070 --> 03:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
 
03:49:12.710 --> 03:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
has indicated they don't see a path
 
03:49:14.870 --> 03:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
forward ever Source has indicated that
 
03:49:16.849 --> 03:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
they don't see a need for this bill
 
03:49:19.250 --> 03:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
we've got the community power
 
03:49:21.710 --> 03:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
aggregation program coming online this
 
03:49:25.370 --> 03:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
spring where over 125 000 New Hampshire
 
03:49:27.769 --> 03:49:27.779 align:start position:0%
customers will be getting their power
 
03:49:31.010 --> 03:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
through Community power aggregation
 
03:49:34.690 --> 03:49:34.700 align:start position:0%
and that organization plans to supply
 
03:49:39.530 --> 03:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
smart meters to customers who want it
 
03:49:41.990 --> 03:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
there just doesn't seem to me to be a
 
03:49:44.210 --> 03:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
worthwhile path forward and so why
 
03:49:46.010 --> 03:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
should we retain a bill that's not going
 
03:49:47.510 --> 03:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
to go anywhere
 
03:49:49.729 --> 03:49:49.739 align:start position:0%
that would be my comment
 
03:49:53.150 --> 03:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative muns thank you Mr chair
 
03:49:53.160 --> 03:49:53.929 align:start position:0%
representative muns thank you Mr chair
um

03:49:53.929 --> 03:49:53.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:53.939 --> 03:49:55.250 align:start position:0%
um
it

03:49:55.250 --> 03:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:49:57.410 --> 03:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
you know there there is some some new
 
03:49:59.870 --> 03:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
information that apparently there is
 
03:50:03.530 --> 03:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
money available through the uh Federal
 
03:50:05.450 --> 03:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
some of the federal bills that have been
 
03:50:05.460 --> 03:50:06.769 align:start position:0%
some of the federal bills that have been
passed

03:50:06.769 --> 03:50:06.779 align:start position:0%
passed
 
03:50:09.469 --> 03:50:09.479 align:start position:0%
um it does require action on the part of
 
03:50:12.110 --> 03:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
the utilities but
 
03:50:13.910 --> 03:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
um I think there may be an opportunity
 
03:50:15.950 --> 03:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
to get funding so that's one thing the
 
03:50:17.929 --> 03:50:17.939 align:start position:0%
second thing is couldn't agree with you
 
03:50:20.210 --> 03:50:20.220 align:start position:0%
more about the fact that we're retaining
 
03:50:22.309 --> 03:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
so many bills
 
03:50:26.510 --> 03:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
um and um you know but but we've honored
 
03:50:29.389 --> 03:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
requests from other members to retain
 
03:50:32.090 --> 03:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
bills we have a member and Prime sponsor
 
03:50:36.170 --> 03:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
that is asking to retain this bill and I
 
03:50:39.349 --> 03:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
think we need to be consistent and if we
 
03:50:41.630 --> 03:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
decide not to honor that request then I
 
03:50:43.550 --> 03:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
think we should go back and look at some
 
03:50:45.710 --> 03:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
of the bills that we voted that we've
 
03:50:47.809 --> 03:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
voted to retain based on similar
 
03:50:47.819 --> 03:50:50.870 align:start position:0%
voted to retain based on similar
requests

03:50:50.870 --> 03:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:54.469 --> 03:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:56.210 --> 03:50:56.220 align:start position:0%
I guess we'll all have to just vote our
 
03:50:57.950 --> 03:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
conscience on this bill so I'll ask the
 
03:50:59.690 --> 03:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role in the question
 
03:51:03.290 --> 03:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
of retain on House Bill six
 
03:51:05.389 --> 03:51:05.399 align:start position:0%
Thirty One
 
03:51:09.410 --> 03:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:10.969 --> 03:51:10.979 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I think we're right that
 
03:51:12.650 --> 03:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
we're retaining too many bills so I'll
 
03:51:14.389 --> 03:51:14.399 align:start position:0%
have to say no
 
03:51:18.530 --> 03:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
Janine naughter no Larry gagne oh
 
03:51:21.110 --> 03:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
try Marner go
 
03:51:26.330 --> 03:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
Charlie Melvin no Lex barajny yes
 
03:51:29.210 --> 03:51:29.220 align:start position:0%
JD Bernardi no
 
03:51:30.950 --> 03:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
Tom closure
 
03:51:30.960 --> 03:51:33.170 align:start position:0%
Tom closure
yes

03:51:33.170 --> 03:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:51:37.190 --> 03:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
James Summers yes
 
03:51:41.690 --> 03:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
uh Rebecca McWilliams yes
 
03:51:45.229 --> 03:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
Rosemary rung yes
 
03:51:50.750 --> 03:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
Jackie creation yes Lucia's partial yes
 
03:51:55.849 --> 03:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
Linda Ryan yes Chris muns yes
 
03:51:58.370 --> 03:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
Henry Noel yes
 
03:52:03.050 --> 03:52:03.060 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas yes Thomas Corman yes Ned
 
03:52:04.910 --> 03:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
Reynolds yes
 
03:52:10.870 --> 03:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:10.880 --> 03:52:12.530 align:start position:0%
 
13-7

03:52:12.530 --> 03:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
13-7
 
03:52:15.229 --> 03:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
5 out of 13-7 the committee votes to
 
03:52:21.530 --> 03:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:25.690 --> 03:52:25.700 align:start position:0%
and the number is now up to 8 out of 12.
 
03:52:28.250 --> 03:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
I don't see any need for a subcommittee
 
03:52:30.650 --> 03:52:30.660 align:start position:0%
on this bill at this time if we decide
 
03:52:32.570 --> 03:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
we need one we can form one in the fall
 
03:52:35.630 --> 03:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
so we'll close the public the exact
 
03:52:39.349 --> 03:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 631 and we have
 
03:52:43.190 --> 03:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
one to go representative Wendy Thomas is
 
03:52:45.590 --> 03:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
waiting on baited breath to get to
 
03:52:48.590 --> 03:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
another committee room to testify on a
 
03:52:50.210 --> 03:52:50.220 align:start position:0%
bill so let's see if we can get through
 
03:52:56.210 --> 03:52:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:59.210 --> 03:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
open an executive session on HB 161
 
03:53:01.370 --> 03:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
relative to customer generators of
 
03:53:01.380 --> 03:53:02.450 align:start position:0%
relative to customer generators of
electricity

03:53:02.450 --> 03:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
03:53:06.530 --> 03:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
as group hosts under net metering and
 
03:53:08.990 --> 03:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative Lex
 
03:53:11.450 --> 03:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
barajny for emotion
 
03:53:14.870 --> 03:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
emotion that we itl HB 161 and I can
 
03:53:16.370 --> 03:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
speak to my motion
 
03:53:18.769 --> 03:53:18.779 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Summers
 
03:53:21.349 --> 03:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
I second that motion been moved and
 
03:53:24.010 --> 03:53:24.020 align:start position:0%
seconded that we itl House Bill 161
 
03:53:26.450 --> 03:53:26.460 align:start position:0%
representative bereshni is recognized
 
03:53:28.910 --> 03:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um so my reason to I
 
03:53:30.490 --> 03:53:30.500 align:start position:0%
tell this one is the same as the
 
03:53:35.570 --> 03:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
previous bill that I um 523 is that the
 
03:53:38.030 --> 03:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
department of energy would like to see
 
03:53:41.150 --> 03:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
the docket with the boc on net metering
 
03:53:43.490 --> 03:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
completed before we make any substantial
 
03:53:46.490 --> 03:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
changes and there was a point made
 
03:53:46.500 --> 03:53:47.630 align:start position:0%
changes and there was a point made
before

03:53:47.630 --> 03:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:53:50.690 --> 03:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
on the previous on that bill that it's
 
03:53:52.790 --> 03:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
up to the legislature to tell the puc
 
03:53:57.290 --> 03:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
what to do and in fact we did HB 1599
 
03:54:00.349 --> 03:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
last year that we passed told the puc to
 
03:54:03.410 --> 03:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
investigate updating uh the net metering
 
03:54:05.990 --> 03:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
so I think if we told them to do that it
 
03:54:07.670 --> 03:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
makes sense to let them finish before we
 
03:54:08.630 --> 03:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
tell them to do something different
 
03:54:11.330 --> 03:54:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:13.849 --> 03:54:13.859 align:start position:0%
additional comment on the motion to itl
 
03:54:19.790 --> 03:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:22.429 --> 03:54:22.439 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds
 
03:54:24.110 --> 03:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:54:28.610 --> 03:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
um against the motion to itl 161 we all
 
03:54:31.309 --> 03:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
got a I believe we all got a
 
03:54:35.030 --> 03:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
email from uh Jim Monahan that was
 
03:54:39.290 --> 03:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
helpful clarifying that this bill was is
 
03:54:42.790 --> 03:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
not any kind of major change to
 
03:54:46.189 --> 03:54:46.199 align:start position:0%
net metering policy it's really a
 
03:54:46.199 --> 03:54:48.710 align:start position:0%
net metering policy it's really a
clarification

03:54:48.710 --> 03:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
03:54:51.410 --> 03:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
um or the correction of perhaps an
 
03:54:54.950 --> 03:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
Omission in the past it's not about uh
 
03:54:57.530 --> 03:54:57.540 align:start position:0%
allowing double counting no one wants
 
03:54:59.450 --> 03:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
any double counting it's it's really
 
03:55:03.110 --> 03:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
just allowing a facility that may
 
03:55:06.650 --> 03:55:06.660 align:start position:0%
already be a net metering facility but
 
03:55:09.650 --> 03:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
whose generation is much smaller than
 
03:55:13.010 --> 03:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
its needs to also participate in a group
 
03:55:16.130 --> 03:55:16.140 align:start position:0%
net metering Arrangement so that uh net
 
03:55:16.140 --> 03:55:17.290 align:start position:0%
net metering Arrangement so that uh net
metering

03:55:17.290 --> 03:55:17.300 align:start position:0%
metering
 
03:55:19.429 --> 03:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
distributed generation somewhere else
 
03:55:23.630 --> 03:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
can help help meet its load so this is
 
03:55:27.889 --> 03:55:27.899 align:start position:0%
just a refinement of existing policy
 
03:55:30.469 --> 03:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
in my view thank you thank you further
 
03:55:30.479 --> 03:55:33.950 align:start position:0%
in my view thank you thank you further
comment

03:55:33.950 --> 03:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.010 --> 03:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams
 
03:55:38.389 --> 03:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
um I'd just like to say that the folks
 
03:55:39.950 --> 03:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
who are able to take advantage of this
 
03:55:41.689 --> 03:55:41.699 align:start position:0%
legislation if we were to pass it out of
 
03:55:43.729 --> 03:55:43.739 align:start position:0%
committee are people who are dedicated
 
03:55:45.950 --> 03:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
already to purchasing renewable energy
 
03:55:47.870 --> 03:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
they probably already have solar panels
 
03:55:50.210 --> 03:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
on the rooftop it's not creating enough
 
03:55:52.849 --> 03:55:52.859 align:start position:0%
energy to completely run their household
 
03:55:54.650 --> 03:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
and so they'd like to then take
 
03:55:57.830 --> 03:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
advantage of purchasing from group group
 
03:56:00.530 --> 03:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh solar elsewhere in the state and
 
03:56:02.330 --> 03:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
they'd like to be able to do both that
 
03:56:03.590 --> 03:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean double dipping it means
 
03:56:06.349 --> 03:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
they'd like to have all Renewables so um
 
03:56:08.450 --> 03:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
in terms of this as an alternative to
 
03:56:10.550 --> 03:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
something like offshore wind I know
 
03:56:12.050 --> 03:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
we've had some concerns that there may
 
03:56:13.790 --> 03:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
be whales killed in the making of
 
03:56:16.010 --> 03:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
offshore wind this is an alternative to
 
03:56:17.269 --> 03:56:17.279 align:start position:0%
allow people to just buy their
 
03:56:19.370 --> 03:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
Renewables from a group net metering for
 
03:56:22.070 --> 03:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
solar thank you
 
03:56:27.530 --> 03:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:30.710 --> 03:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that this bill is an
 
03:56:32.809 --> 03:56:32.819 align:start position:0%
expansion of
 
03:56:36.050 --> 03:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
group host net metering and the governor
 
03:56:39.110 --> 03:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
has consistently vetoed
 
03:56:42.110 --> 03:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
net metering expansion bills over the
 
03:56:44.389 --> 03:56:44.399 align:start position:0%
course of the last four or five years I
 
03:56:46.429 --> 03:56:46.439 align:start position:0%
think should this bill emerge from
 
03:56:49.189 --> 03:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
committee successfully in and emerge
 
03:56:50.630 --> 03:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
from the house successfully it would
 
03:56:52.610 --> 03:56:52.620 align:start position:0%
never either get through the senate or
 
03:56:54.349 --> 03:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
pass the governor
 
03:56:57.650 --> 03:56:57.660 align:start position:0%
I think the the best path forward for
 
03:57:00.469 --> 03:57:00.479 align:start position:0%
this bill is to Simply wait and see what
 
03:57:02.450 --> 03:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
future net metering tariffs are going to
 
03:57:04.370 --> 03:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
look like and we'll know that once the
 
03:57:07.969 --> 03:57:07.979 align:start position:0%
current net metering docket is completed
 
03:57:10.189 --> 03:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
and I think there's no need for any
 
03:57:13.010 --> 03:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
change in net metering policy especially
 
03:57:16.250 --> 03:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
policy that was likely to go nowhere
 
03:57:20.330 --> 03:57:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:22.070 --> 03:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
so you know further comment I'll ask the
 
03:57:23.929 --> 03:57:23.939 align:start position:0%
Kirk to call the roll on the question of
 
03:57:28.490 --> 03:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:30.110 --> 03:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
