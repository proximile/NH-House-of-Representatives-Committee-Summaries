00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
um I have to say I'm a little less
 
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
lonely than I was a few minutes ago but
 
00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 align:start position:0%
um uh hopefully we'll get another
 
00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 align:start position:0%
another couple of our folks in here so
 
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 align:start position:0%
representative soucy will be here but
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
he's on his way back from a dental
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
appointment and uh he'll be here in a
 
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
bit but I think uh out of respect for
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
the folks who are here in a timely
 
00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
manner we should get underway
 
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
um since this is not a
 
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.990 align:start position:0%
um since this is not a
official

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
official
 
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
um it's a subcommittee meeting but it is
 
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee meeting where we are
 
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
looking to hear from
 
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
um interested parties in this uh this
 
00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
bill for public sector OSHA
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
I'll just do a little introduction and
 
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
then I'll be opening the floor to uh the
 
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
folks here who um want to provide some
 
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.350 align:start position:0%
folks here who um want to provide some
input

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
input
 
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
um just for for a little bit of
 
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.930 align:start position:0%
um just for for a little bit of
background

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
um this will be perhaps repetitious from
 
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
last week what this bill does is it uh
 
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
um replaces the New Hampshire Department
 
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
of Labor's safety standards with the
 
00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 align:start position:0%
OSHA 1910 safety standards
 
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
um it does not this is what the bill
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
does not do is create a
 
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
um an OSHA state plan for New Hampshire
 
00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
that has been contemplated but the study
 
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
committee that met a year ago reached
 
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
the conclusion that we didn't want to go
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
that far at this point we wanted to
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
Simply update the the safety standards
 
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
Department Department of Labor safety
 
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:18.500 align:start position:0%
standards have really been updated or
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
really addressed in any substantial way
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
for 10 or more years and um rather than
 
00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
trying to update them
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
in a comprehensive way
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
these study committee thought it would
 
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
be more
 
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
more appropriate and more complete to
 
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
Simply adopt the OSHA standards
 
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.890 align:start position:0%
Simply adopt the OSHA standards
um

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:41.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
effectively we don't even need to tell
 
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
OSHA that we're doing this
 
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
we're just adopting the standards the
 
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:50.900 align:start position:0%
States of Maine and Massachusetts
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
followed a similar path
 
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
their trip to having a state plan
 
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.170 align:start position:0%
their trip to having a state plan
um

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
they adopted the OSHA standards for for
 
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
their safety standards and lived under
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
them for I'm not sure how many years but
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
some number of years and then later on
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
decided that they wanted to look at
 
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
adopting the state plan
 
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
um there's no commitment or indication
 
00:08:19.969 --> 00:08:19.979 align:start position:0%
that we will ever do that we may we may
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
not but it's for definitely a different
 
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.309 align:start position:0%
not but it's for definitely a different
time

00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:32.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.209 --> 00:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
once these standards are adopted it will
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
still be our department of labor and our
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
department of labor inspectors who are
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
enforcing those standards they will do
 
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
so in the same manner that they've
 
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
enforced the New Hampshire standards or
 
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
the department of labor standards and
 
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
I'm pleased and proud to say that we
 
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
have a very
 
00:08:59.650 --> 00:08:59.660 align:start position:0%
um uh a non-punitive Department of Labor
 
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
they will
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
um you know uh
 
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
hand out fines when uh when necessary
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
and appropriate but more generally if
 
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
they find a
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
a problem they're more focused on
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
solving the problem rather than
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
um sending out fines so that's what our
 
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
department of labor is about they will
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
continue to be like that they will
 
00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:24.899 align:start position:0%
simply have a more comprehensive set of
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
Standards last point before I open it up
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
um because the New Hampshire Department
 
00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
of Labor standards are
 
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
substantially incomplete
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
there are times when inspectors will
 
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
find a situation that is clearly unsafe
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
and it's clearly not addressed in the
 
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
department of labor standards
 
00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
what they will do in those instances is
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
lean on the general duties clause which
 
00:09:57.769 --> 00:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
is sort of a catch-all it's a clause
 
00:09:59.329 --> 00:09:59.339 align:start position:0%
that basically says things ought to be
 
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
safe out there folks and
 
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
um with the and often what they will do
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
in backing that up is they'll look to
 
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
the OSHA standards and and and see if
 
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
the OSHA has something often it does so
 
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor is already using
 
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards in some instances
 
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:23.220 align:start position:0%
this will simply put everyone on notice
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
that those are the standards that will
 
00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
be applied and um frankly in my view
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
it's unfair
 
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.410 align:start position:0%
it's unfair
to

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
um find a safety uh violation
 
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
and then go to a standard that's not
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
cited in our statutes
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
I believe once these standards are
 
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
adopted by New Hampshire it'll everyone
 
00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:50.459 align:start position:0%
will be on notice these are the
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
standards that we're all going to follow
 
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
um and in our department will continue
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
to be more educational and punitive so
 
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
with that I know there's several folks
 
00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
who want to uh I have a say what I ask
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
is since we're not doing pink cards and
 
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
all that stuff when you come up identify
 
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
yourself I'm going to get your name down
 
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
and what organization you represent so
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Michael Fitzgerald
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
I am the assistant director of the air
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
division at the Department of
 
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:42.260 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
and uh with me also today is Mike little
 
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
Mike is the uh manager of our air
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
monitoring program uh
 
00:11:56.569 --> 00:11:56.579 align:start position:0%
we operate a network of 13 air
 
00:11:59.930 --> 00:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
monitoring stations around the state uh
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
to monitor air quality provide data to
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
us to to put out forecasts you may hear
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
when there's poor air quality this
 
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:11.339 align:start position:0%
summer you probably heard a lot about
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
the Quebec wildfires and and we
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
collected a lot of data and information
 
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
and we're able to put that out just you
 
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
know on your weather forecast sometimes
 
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
you get the air quality forecast a lot
 
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
of that information comes from us the
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
information that we gather is also used
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
to determine the state's compliance with
 
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
Federal standards for air quality and to
 
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
ensure that we are meeting those
 
00:12:40.329 --> 00:12:40.339 align:start position:0%
standards or if we're not meeting them
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
to determine what we need to do in order
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
to meet them a lot of the pollution
 
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:46.820 align:start position:0%
comes from Cars and Trucks
 
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:50.519 align:start position:0%
factories power plants Etc and so our
 
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
network of monitors is is around the
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
state and it's placed magically and
 
00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
approved by EPA to make sure that we're
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
monitoring appropriately we can't
 
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
monitor everywhere but the network is is
 
00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:05.459 align:start position:0%
intended to be uh
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
representative of air quality throughout
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
the state and and in certain particular
 
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.230 align:start position:0%
the state and and in certain particular
locations

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
locations
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
so with that a few years ago we became
 
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
aware of a requirement under OSHA
 
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
standards and the national electrical
 
00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:22.519 align:start position:0%
code called nrtl
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized Testing
 
00:13:24.839 --> 00:13:26.269 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized Testing
Laboratories

00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
Laboratories
 
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
and I can send the committee some
 
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
website information it's an OSHA program
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
but basically when you purchase a piece
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
of electrical equipment and it has an
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
underwriter's laboratory
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
UL sticker on it that's what we're
 
00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:44.459 align:start position:0%
talking about nrt
 
00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
UL Underwriters Laboratory is an nrtl a
 
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized testing Laboratory
 
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
and under that program
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
um and again we're not experts we do
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
have electricians on staff and and but
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
we we're not experts in this area we
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
have consulted with
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
um the uh Folks at the department of
 
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
safety the electrical code folks
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
um on on this issue but uh it appears to
 
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
us that uh under the under these OSHA
 
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
standards this nrtl listing is required
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
for what's uh what it refers to as
 
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.670 align:start position:0%
for what's uh what it refers to as
instruments

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
instruments
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
we have not been able to make an
 
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
ultimate determination as to whether
 
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:29.300 align:start position:0%
some of the highly sophisticated
 
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
instrumentation that we have is subject
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
to this requirement or not but we have
 
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
assumed that it that it is again so a
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
lot of this equipment is extremely
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
sophisticated it's it's takes
 
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:49.100 align:start position:0%
samples of air measures the the
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
particulate matter or ozone or other
 
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
chemical components and transmits that
 
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:00.860 align:start position:0%
data back to our our offices and
 
00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:03.079 align:start position:0%
the instrumentation
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
is not your average every day it's not a
 
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
limp or a heater or washing machine or
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
whatever some of these are twenty thirty
 
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
thousand forty thousand dollar
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
instruments and some of them come from
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
outside of the United States they're the
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
only ones that are certified by EPA we
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
currently have uh you know
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands if not millions of
 
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
dollars of equipment deployed around the
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
state and the vast majority of it is
 
00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:32.339 align:start position:0%
nrtl certified does have some type of a
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
label from from the uh and I have a
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
listing here of all the nrtls as I say
 
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:41.220 align:start position:0%
one UL is one of them that's the one
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
that you're probably most familiar with
 
00:15:47.569 --> 00:15:47.579 align:start position:0%
um but some of our instrumentation is 10
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
15 years old and is is not and has never
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
been certified we have actually sent
 
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
some of our instrumentation out to uh
 
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
and paid for it to be certified and our
 
00:16:02.569 --> 00:16:02.579 align:start position:0%
policy is to only purchase nrtl
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
certified equipment if possible however
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
there are certain cases and and I would
 
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
defer to Mike here but over the last
 
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
several years
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
we've most of the equipment that we've
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
purchased has been available as nrtl
 
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
certified and we have
 
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:22.790 align:start position:0%
certified and we have
um

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
put that in our spec for purchasing when
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
we work with the Department of
 
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
purchasing here in the state Das and I
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
think in general we have not had any
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
issues with new equipment that that has
 
00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:40.139 align:start position:0%
not been nrtl certified
 
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
um so this is an issue we just wanted to
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
put on your radar screen to
 
00:16:47.329 --> 00:16:47.339 align:start position:0%
um to understand that we do have some
 
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
equipment it would be extremely costly
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
to replace we do you know every 10 or 15
 
00:16:55.009 --> 00:16:55.019 align:start position:0%
years we turn equipment over and and
 
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
purchase new equipment but we do have
 
00:16:59.210 --> 00:16:59.220 align:start position:0%
some equipment that may not be in RTL
 
00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.449 align:start position:0%
some equipment that may not be in RTL
certified

00:17:01.449 --> 00:17:01.459 align:start position:0%
certified
 
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
we would just seek for the Committees to
 
00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
take considerate take that into
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
consideration and perhaps allow the
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor in its whatever
 
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
rulemaking they have to do following
 
00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.569 align:start position:0%
rulemaking they have to do following
this

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:16.579 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.669 align:start position:0%
this
to

00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
Grant an exemption for uh for some of
 
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
this equipment
 
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
um again it's not your
 
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
not your everyday off the shelf you know
 
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
just go down to Lowe's and purchase an
 
00:17:30.289 --> 00:17:30.299 align:start position:0%
air monitor
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
um so that's our situation I'd be happy
 
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
to take questions on uh
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
any any of these concerns and again
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're just looking to have this this
 
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
recognized and and perhaps some
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
allowance made for in case we need to
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
purchase this equipment
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
um in the future and we're not able to
 
00:17:57.049 --> 00:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
get it in RTL certified it may be made
 
00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
in Sweden or somewhere like that and
 
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.010 align:start position:0%
in Sweden or somewhere like that and
they

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
um and again we we would be happy we do
 
00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:06.539 align:start position:0%
we have actually bought equipment and
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
paid to have it certified if that if if
 
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
it's possible so
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
um we're not trying to get away uh
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
without uh meeting these requirements um
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
there are just certain very
 
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.810 align:start position:0%
there are just certain very
uh

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:19.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
specialized cases that might need some
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
attention thank you
 
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to ask the Department of
 
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
Labor to to weigh in uh but first are
 
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
there questions from the other members
 
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.970 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
um not sure who's who's
 
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:38.390 align:start position:0%
um not sure who's who's
um

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
up at bat but uh is is the Department of
 
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
good morning Representatives I'm happy
 
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
to take any questions on what was just
 
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
testified too well I I guess uh the uh
 
00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:12.419 align:start position:0%
the question that I would have is we've
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
heard a detailed explanation as to what
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
the the issue is
 
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
um it sounds you know a very legitimate
 
00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:21.539 align:start position:0%
concern from the Department of
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
um can you give some idea as to how the
 
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor would handle
 
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
um a situation like that unless I think
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
first of all one it would depend on
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
um you know what the equipment actually
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
is without knowing what it is
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
um whether it fits in with the
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
requirements how far off it is it's
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
tough to say Obviously a lot of these
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
things are going to be a case-by-case
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
basis the other point being that as was
 
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
testified to if the legislature were to
 
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059 align:start position:0%
give the department rulemaking authority
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
to provide exemptions of course then we
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
could consider that again we would have
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
to weigh it against how far from the
 
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
actual requirements of Osha the
 
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
equipment is and I would say as I think
 
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
I testified to last week the caveat with
 
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
all of this is anything shifting from
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
this as far as exemption goes as far as
 
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
rule making for the Department may have
 
00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
to be considered in the future if the
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
intent in the future is to go to a full
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
OSHA state plan because that may impact
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
OSHA actually accepting the plan
 
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
obviously that's down the line but I
 
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
think it's something that should be
 
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
considered nonetheless I I would say for
 
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
the purposes today let's not even think
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
about this estate plan because it's uh
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
safety unit excuse me falls under my
 
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.690 align:start position:0%
safety unit excuse me falls under my
supervision

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:43.700 align:start position:0%
supervision
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
So currently under our current law if
 
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
someone is operating Machinery uh the
 
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
obligations they operate it
 
00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:51.590 align:start position:0%
obligations they operate it
um

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
in good condition maintaining the
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
Machinery in good condition use it under
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
all machine gartering guarding necessary
 
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
to operate it and make sure the machine
 
00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:03.299 align:start position:0%
guarding is under is in good condition
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
and they are required to operate it as
 
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
prescribed by the manual the operation
 
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
manual so for example if the you know
 
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
saw has to be maintained at a horizontal
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
um trajectory if they're using it to saw
 
00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
something in a vertical no
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
um that's that would be something that
 
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
they would that would be in violation of
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
our standards
 
00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
um if an OSHA requirement makes it more
 
00:21:30.409 --> 00:21:30.419 align:start position:0%
formal in excess of the manual then that
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
would be what we would hold them
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
accountable to the 1910 requirements
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's coming back
 
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.330 align:start position:0%
it's coming back
so

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
tell me tell me how you get to OSHA
 
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
covering equipment
 
00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
when we have no OSHA standard for public
 
00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.049 align:start position:0%
when we have no OSHA standard for public
sector

00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:00.059 align:start position:0%
sector
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
how is it that we make how is it right
 
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
now this draw those connections so I
 
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
just wanted to correct something so
 
00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
there is a general duties Clause that is
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
correct but the general duties Clause
 
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
that controls an employer's obligation
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
so an employer is expected under Twitter
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
and a64.
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
where the general duties Clause is
 
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
captured to um oversee you know evaluate
 
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
their um what their work what what are
 
00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
they requiring their employees to do and
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
they have to keep it in they have a
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
general duty to provide all safety
 
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
equipment that they need to for them to
 
00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:36.539 align:start position:0%
do their work safely
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
so when we go in
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
if it's not something specifically
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
enumerated under the 1400s or 277a we
 
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
then look to 277 17 and 18. so 277 17
 
00:22:54.409 --> 00:22:54.419 align:start position:0%
and 18.
 
00:22:57.169 --> 00:22:57.179 align:start position:0%
um allow us to allow for a mod to modify
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
a person's safety program so under 281
 
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
sorry 281 a64 all employers are required
 
00:23:06.289 --> 00:23:06.299 align:start position:0%
to have a safety program so they've
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
looked at their what they're entitled
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
intending for their employees to do
 
00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
they've evaluated and they've created a
 
00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
program for them to do it safely to
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
include training and discipline and
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
oversight and chain of command for
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
communication between managers and
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
supervisors and employees to maintain a
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
general safe work environment in
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the joint Loss
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
Management committee
 
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:28.909 align:start position:0%
Management committee
um

00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
so if they are not so they are to
 
00:23:33.529 --> 00:23:33.539 align:start position:0%
evaluate the workforce figure out all of
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
um problems that they can foresee and
 
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
then provide it and maintain it safely
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
when we go in if we see it there's
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
something that's not safe
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
and we don't have a specific law under
 
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
277 or the 1400 rules to control
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
we then can go to this 277 17 and 18
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
which is where it provides us to put to
 
00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
um to order additional safeguards or to
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
modify their safety program
 
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
we don't often go to OSHA for those I
 
00:24:05.409 --> 00:24:05.419 align:start position:0%
just wanted to correct that
 
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:07.860 align:start position:0%
oftentimes what we find is that there's
 
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
a common sense or breakdown of
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
communication that needs to be tweaked
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
in a safety program so for example
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
there was a recent death of a state
 
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.330 align:start position:0%
there was a recent death of a state
trooper

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:19.340 align:start position:0%
trooper
 
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
and what we found after we did our
 
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
investigation under 277 15-b the serious
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
bodily injury investigation uh was that
 
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
there was just a breakdown of
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
communication between Dot and dos as to
 
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
where this Trooper was supposed to
 
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
report to communicate and find out where
 
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
to safely park there is no specific
 
00:24:42.649 --> 00:24:42.659 align:start position:0%
statue that would not fall under OSHA
 
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
either but there is a statute under dots
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
um statutory rulings that say that dot
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
controls all work sites so there we
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
provided a an additional safeguard that
 
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
we want under 277 I believe it's 18 that
 
00:25:00.049 --> 00:25:00.059 align:start position:0%
all state troopers need to be educated
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
with respect to the dot statute that dot
 
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
controls and they're supposed to report
 
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:07.740 align:start position:0%
to the Dot site manager and find out
 
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
where to safely Park that wouldn't have
 
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
been and most of our cases are like that
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
where it there really is some sort of
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
breakdown of communication or something
 
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
that the employer did not foresee in
 
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
their safety program that needs to be
 
00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
tweaked so most of the time we do not
 
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
get to OSHA but we would you know if we
 
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
find a situation that's not addressed by
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
any one of our state laws we then can
 
00:25:33.049 --> 00:25:33.059 align:start position:0%
suggest an additional Safeguard and we
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
can go to another resource like OSHA but
 
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
again we try to find something that
 
00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
makes the most sense in the most
 
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
efficient way possible so
 
00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:42.470 align:start position:0%
efficient way possible so
um

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
you know if there's you know if we don't
 
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
go for the most extreme
 
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
um safety requirement in all of our
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations we go for the one that
 
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
will get the job done
 
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
and so so the way that you get to osher
 
00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.110 align:start position:0%
and so so the way that you get to osher
um

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
is that you you develop your own safety
 
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
plan as I understand it no the employer
 
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
develops their safety plans I guess I'm
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
an environmental services okay yeah so
 
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
right now our concern is that this
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
legislation passes and
 
00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
uh we would then be subject to these
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
requirements under the Department of
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
Labor as they would continue to be able
 
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
to uh certification so right now we we
 
00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:45.740 align:start position:0%
feel you know we're not subject to this
 
00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:50.169 align:start position:0%
feel you know we're not subject to this
communication

00:26:50.169 --> 00:26:50.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
inspectors and so on I had a brief
 
00:26:54.169 --> 00:26:54.179 align:start position:0%
conversation with someone at the
 
00:26:57.529 --> 00:26:57.539 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor a year to go on this
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
um but uh
 
00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
concern is that if this legislation will
 
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.390 align:start position:0%
concern is that if this legislation will
control

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
and and what we want to make sure is
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
that the department has what it's it
 
00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
needs in order to implement this
 
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
um and what I'm hearing is uh some
 
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
rule-making Authority would be of some
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
help to you folks in order to make
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
exceptions and uh and such is that
 
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.049 align:start position:0%
exceptions and uh and such is that
correct

00:27:24.049 --> 00:27:24.059 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
so the um yes there would be room making
 
00:27:30.409 --> 00:27:30.419 align:start position:0%
Authority needed for exceptions but I
 
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
again there's
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
exceptions only go so and that could be
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
tricky too so if you're trying to set a
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
standard then you allow for Exceptions
 
00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
there can be a slippery slope so I just
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
I I hear you what I'm trying to make you
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
sure I mean it sounds like the
 
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services has
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
a legitimate uh concern and we want to
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that that concern can be
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
addressed and um I I guess we need to
 
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
work with you folks to figure out how we
 
00:27:57.769 --> 00:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:27:58.850 --> 00:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
um because
 
00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.830 align:start position:0%
um because
um

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure you're able to
 
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
continue doing the good work that you do
 
00:28:09.409 --> 00:28:09.419 align:start position:0%
um and uh simply have an upgraded set of
 
00:28:09.419 --> 00:28:10.909 align:start position:0%
um and uh simply have an upgraded set of
standards

00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
um so uh that's that's on my list of
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
things to work on so
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
um don't don't get too comfortable
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.409 --> 00:28:27.419 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
just a general question if we adopt the
 
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards would it make your job
 
00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.610 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards would it make your job
easier

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
easier
 
00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.490 align:start position:0%
easier
so

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:44.330 align:start position:0%
 
to

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.990 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
so you know the the answer for that is
 
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.310 align:start position:0%
so you know the the answer for that is
um

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
so OSHA standards they are constantly
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
changing and they incorporate things by
 
00:29:00.409 --> 00:29:00.419 align:start position:0%
reference as well so the wholesale
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
adoption of 1910 is going to be very
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
complicated for our constituents you
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
know to follow so we're going to have to
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
be able to hire more staff who's who are
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
going to be able to read interpret
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
federal law and then reduce it to a
 
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
level that can be understood by a
 
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.970 align:start position:0%
level that can be understood by a
non-attorney

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
non-attorney
 
00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:20.570 align:start position:0%
non-attorney
um

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
so and then on stay on top of it because
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
again they are constantly changing so
 
00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:27.380 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that we would have
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
is when they in court when 1910
 
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
incorporates things by reference when
 
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
the federal government updates those
 
00:29:36.529 --> 00:29:36.539 align:start position:0%
reference points what's going to happen
 
00:29:39.409 --> 00:29:39.419 align:start position:0%
with our laws will it just be frozen the
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
time of adoption and you know so that we
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
do have current laws like that where
 
00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
we've adopted a federal
 
00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.269 align:start position:0%
we've adopted a federal
um

00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
opinion of opinions a loose term but uh
 
00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
from 2014 and then that's that's been
 
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
where we've stayed
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
um going forward
 
00:29:59.690 --> 00:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
um but what will it look like uh in 1910
 
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
is a question I have with you guys uh is
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
will it be an evolving thing in which uh
 
00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
we will constantly have to be uh staying
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
on top of the evolution of the federal
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
government or you know or is it
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
something in which it will remain
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
Frozen so that you know we have the
 
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
ability to educate and keep consistency
 
00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:21.059 align:start position:0%
with the people that we're trying to
 
00:30:21.059 --> 00:30:22.010 align:start position:0%
with the people that we're trying to
serve

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
serve
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
I I guess what I would suggest is that
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
one of the problems we're addressing
 
00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
today is the fact that the standards
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
have been frozen for um for over 10
 
00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.269 align:start position:0%
have been frozen for um for over 10
years

00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know that we would want to
 
00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
get into a situation where we would be
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
freezing them again
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
um at the 2023
 
00:30:42.769 --> 00:30:42.779 align:start position:0%
um state so
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
um I I think one of the attractive
 
00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:48.419 align:start position:0%
aspects of doing this to me is is that
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
there will be a continuous upgrade to
 
00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
the safety standards so 20 years from
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
now we will find that we are operating
 
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
under up-to-date modern uh safety
 
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.850 align:start position:0%
under up-to-date modern uh safety
standards

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
um that's one of the main reasons for
 
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
doing this we haven't been upgrading the
 
00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:09.740 align:start position:0%
standards in New Hampshire this will
 
00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
maintain continuous upgrades it's
 
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.330 align:start position:0%
maintain continuous upgrades it's
yep

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:19.970 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:19.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm not certain about and I guess I
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
would like some clarification on is
 
00:31:27.769 --> 00:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
when there's a situation where a state
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
public entity is subcontracting out to a
 
00:31:33.529 --> 00:31:33.539 align:start position:0%
private entity and they are in essence
 
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
working side by side on a job
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
and the private entity has an accident
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
on the job and OSHA is there to
 
00:31:42.169 --> 00:31:42.179 align:start position:0%
investigate the accident
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
where what's the position of the state's
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
team that was also on that job and does
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
OSHA start to investigate them or are
 
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
you falling under a completely different
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
standard while the private contractor
 
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
who's working for you is now being
 
00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
investigated by OSHA that happens now
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
um so so
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
um currently what happens is OSHA will
 
00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:02.820 align:start position:0%
look at it from the lens of the private
 
00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:04.860 align:start position:0%
employer we will look at it from the
 
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
lens of the private employees Public
 
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
Employee or and the danger that may or
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
may not impact the employees so an
 
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
example is we were investigating a
 
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
serious bodily injury at the Keen
 
00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant they had
 
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
hired an electrical contractor to come
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
in and do some work
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh that electrical contractor
 
00:32:27.289 --> 00:32:27.299 align:start position:0%
um was electrocuted and was deceased so
 
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
that caused an investigation under 277
 
00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
15b for us even though it impacts a a
 
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:34.919 align:start position:0%
private contractor it still triggers
 
00:32:36.649 --> 00:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
that where the public employer has to
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
contact us and let us know within eight
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
hours we went in and OSHA worked
 
00:32:45.649 --> 00:32:45.659 align:start position:0%
alongside us
 
00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:48.539 align:start position:0%
and OSHA we shared data and things that
 
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
you know investigatory notes uh and we
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
were they were looking at it was was
 
00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
that employee that public sorry private
 
00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
employer you employee utilizing all
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
safety standards their answer was no
 
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.140 align:start position:0%
what we were looking at was what did the
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
our public employer know about that
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
private subcontractor uh when they hired
 
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.610 align:start position:0%
private subcontractor uh when they hired
them

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
um did they so that because when they
 
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
hired that you know potentially
 
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
dangerous employer uh private employer
 
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh they may have been creating a
 
00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:21.140 align:start position:0%
dangerous condition for our public
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
employees so you know did they know that
 
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
that person had a bad reputation as
 
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
being a cowboy not utilizing
 
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
um proper safety gear when their
 
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
employees responded to that emergency
 
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
did they respond in accordance with
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
their training you know did they shut
 
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
down the electrical power before they
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
started to engage in and enter that room
 
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
which had been electrified how close
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
were the automatic defibrillator devices
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
so you know because again we have to put
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
the although it happened to a private
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
employee employee
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
we have to put you know imagine so that
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
we're a public employee that was on that
 
00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.430 align:start position:0%
we're a public employee that was on that
floor

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
um so how quickly can uh the that Public
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
Employee render be given Aid so um so so
 
00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
we are basically doing the OSHA type
 
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
inspection not to you know to our
 
00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.450 align:start position:0%
inspection not to you know to our
standards

00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:34:16.609 --> 00:34:16.619 align:start position:0%
um you know looking at it from both the
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
response and you know the from the shoes
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
of an employee being on that floor
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
Public Employee being on that floor
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
being the victim and also the other
 
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
public employees had to engage with that
 
00:34:28.369 --> 00:34:28.379 align:start position:0%
subcontractor I don't know if that made
 
00:34:28.379 --> 00:34:29.690 align:start position:0%
subcontractor I don't know if that made
sense

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:30.770 align:start position:0%
sense
um

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that and did make sense
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
let's go back to the dot situation
 
00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
um where the dot I believe you said sets
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
the standards for the safety standards
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
of where the um their traffic you know
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
their traffic so there are times that
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
dot hires private entities and I've seen
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
that so um what happens if a flagger is
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
injured on the on the job who is a
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
private entity working for the dot under
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
the dot standards who then is
 
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
responsible for for that accident
 
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
with so if there if there are public
 
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
employees also working at that job site
 
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
so if dot is simply outsourced it and
 
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
and there you know the the
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
um construction is being done by an
 
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
outside contractor it doesn't fall under
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
our authority to maintain a safe work
 
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
environment because no Public Employee
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
could be there at that job site now if a
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
Public Employee could for instance if
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
they retain oversight uh and that's just
 
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
something we would call about you know
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
if they retain oversight and control and
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
they're routinely going to the job site
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
to you know see how it's you know make
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
sure it's staying on track then then it
 
00:35:43.609 --> 00:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
could fall under jurisdiction to figure
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
out you know what the nature of the
 
00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:47.579 align:start position:0%
Accident Injury and could it impact a
 
00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:52.810 align:start position:0%
okay
thank you

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:52.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:58.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
so in the in the case of the
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
SE spoke about King
 
00:36:05.569 --> 00:36:05.579 align:start position:0%
who has jurisdiction
 
00:36:05.579 --> 00:36:07.670 align:start position:0%
who has jurisdiction
dual

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
dual
 
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:10.140 align:start position:0%
so they would have jurisdiction so that
 
00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
we can't order the private employer to
 
00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
retrain their employees to utilize
 
00:36:19.609 --> 00:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
proper safety standards under OSHA that
 
00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:22.140 align:start position:0%
would be falling under OSHA
 
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
for us we would put probably an
 
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
additional Safeguard or modification if
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
we found out that they hadn't checked
 
00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:32.220 align:start position:0%
references uh if they if the electrified
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
person the deceased person the victim ha
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
didn't have a license why didn't you
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
chat you know you know you should be
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
hiring only licensed people and maybe
 
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
there would be additional safe order
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
modification issued by us
 
00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
um under 277 17 and 18.
 
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.410 align:start position:0%
um under 277 17 and 18.
um

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
if we found that the um the employees
 
00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
didn't know how to render Aid or didn't
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
have a safety plan in place for
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
responding to emergencies our laws
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
already control that we would say you
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
have to create a safety program that
 
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
accounts for that and that would fall
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
under us under our jurisdiction because
 
00:37:07.849 --> 00:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
OSHA would not have jurisdiction to jump
 
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
into our world
 
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
and is it fair to say that uh this
 
00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
rather complex interaction
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
um that you presently
 
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:20.099 align:start position:0%
um experience would continue
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
um regardless of whether or not we adopt
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
OSHA safety standards
 
00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:26.940 align:start position:0%
um yeah what the same relationship would
 
00:37:29.089 --> 00:37:29.099 align:start position:0%
continue right
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
I just want to be clear that I mean it's
 
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
interesting to uh be aware of those
 
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.490 align:start position:0%
interesting to uh be aware of those
interactions

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
interactions
 
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
um but they will they'll carry on
 
00:37:37.609 --> 00:37:37.619 align:start position:0%
because there will still be an OSHA and
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
there will still be a New Hampshire
 
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor responsible for
 
00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
private on one side public on the other
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
side I think that would agree I know we
 
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
weren't supposed to discuss OSHA state
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
but I think that would even occur up
 
00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
here in an ocean
 
00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
still be dual investigators coming in us
 
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
being in the shoes of an OSHA state
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
employee and the OSHA state employee for
 
00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
the private
 
00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's a final question
 
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.310 align:start position:0%
it's a final question
um

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
so is that double jeopardy for a
 
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
employer so now we have the state has
 
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:11.940 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction the federal government has
 
00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:14.220 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction both of you can proceed
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
against the the company is that right no
 
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
so I'm only looking at the public I'm
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
only looking at Key and Wastewater
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
OSHA's looking at Mr electricity Inc
 
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
um so you know and so our cases are
 
00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
separate and apart and going in
 
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
completely different directions
 
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay the floor is open to other folks
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
annoy people from the counties uh
 
00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
available today
 
00:38:52.859 --> 00:38:55.730 align:start position:0%
available today
um

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
I see my my friend from Sullivan County
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
if you could both identify yourselves
 
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
and who you are and what you're from
 
00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
Hillary snide I'm the Director of Human
 
00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm Mary Burke I'm the director of
 
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
facilities and operations for Sullivan
 
00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.329 align:start position:0%
facilities and operations for Sullivan
County

00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:23.339 align:start position:0%
County
 
00:39:23.339 --> 00:39:24.290 align:start position:0%
County
um

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:24.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to note I've
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
spent more than 18 years of my
 
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
professional career within the
 
00:39:32.089 --> 00:39:32.099 align:start position:0%
facilities management industry both in
 
00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:35.099 align:start position:0%
the private sector for 12 years and uh
 
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
in the public sector at Sullivan County
 
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
for the last six years
 
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:41.220 align:start position:0%
um Sullivan County takes the safety of
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
your employees seriously and our
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB 232 is not to imply
 
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
otherwise however we do have some
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
concerns in the adoption of 1910 OSHA so
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
as we've heard New Hampshire DOL
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
enforces RSA 277 and other
 
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
administrative rules to protect public
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
employees and due to these due to the
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
varied nature of the work that counties
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
do to provide services to the
 
00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:14.420 align:start position:0%
communities our safety programs are very
 
00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:17.220 align:start position:0%
decentralized based on those diverse
 
00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
options and our work is also governed by
 
00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
other safety rules and regulations
 
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
enforced by other agencies is like the
 
00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
EPA NFPA and Department of Health and
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
Human Services amongst others in fact
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
more than two-thirds of the Sullivan
 
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
County's 300 employees work in Sullivan
 
00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
County healthcare our nursing home which
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
is subject to on-site licensing survey
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
every year done in person by New
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DHHS and it holds us to a
 
00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
higher operating standard than OSHA
 
00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
because of this annual in-person
 
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.630 align:start position:0%
because of this annual in-person
evaluation

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
00:40:56.089 --> 00:40:56.099 align:start position:0%
our training records on subjects like
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
emergency evacuation bloodborne
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
pathogens and workplace chemicals are
 
00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
examined as part of that audit with
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
deficiencies given when training is
 
00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
found to not be satisfactory
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
so current state rules and regulations
 
00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
do not prescribe training requirements
 
00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
or frequencies on most topics like 1910
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
OSHA does
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
OSHA details specific training topics
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
that must be covered sets forth training
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
frequencies and requires training to be
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
given by qualified instructors
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
in 1910 21
 
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
OSHA defines qualified as a person who
 
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
by possession of a recognized degree
 
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
certificate or professional standing or
 
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
by extensive knowledge training and
 
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
experience has successfully demonstrated
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
the ability to solve or resolve problems
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
related to the subject matter the work
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
or the project
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
while we have some of our safety
 
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
training completed by outside resources
 
00:41:55.849 --> 00:41:55.859 align:start position:0%
a large majority of our safety training
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
is done by our own supervisors or
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
in-house trainers
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
while demonstrated ability in the OSHA
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
standard does provide some leeway it is
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
very ambiguous from a risk management
 
00:42:10.609 --> 00:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
perspective as to which authority would
 
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
deem someone qualified and what does
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
happen when Sullivan County deems an
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
in-house trainer to be qualified in the
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
Department Labor disagrees
 
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
if the intent of HB 232 is to provide
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
the level of protection of 1910 OSHA our
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
interpretation would mean that Sullivan
 
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
County would need to seek higher
 
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
credentials for our trainers in
 
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
additional outside sources at higher
 
00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:37.790 align:start position:0%
additional outside sources at higher
cost

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
although not mandatory by OSHA Sullivan
 
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
County looks to OSHA's recommended 10
 
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
hour and 30-hour training thresholds for
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
General employees and supervisors and
 
00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:50.339 align:start position:0%
Specialty staffs respectively as
 
00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
guidance for the level of training
 
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
necessary to comply with the spirit of
 
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:55.970 align:start position:0%
necessary to comply with the spirit of
1910.

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
1910.
 
00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
to manage additional training
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
requirements keep up with ever-changing
 
00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:02.300 align:start position:0%
federal regulations
 
00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
credentialing training our own training
 
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
resources and additional record-keeping
 
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
requirements the county anticipates the
 
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
need to create an additional full-time
 
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
management position of health and safety
 
00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:15.050 align:start position:0%
management position of health and safety
manager

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
manager
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
we looked at two local job listings
 
00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
within 20 miles of our facility and
 
00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:21.349 align:start position:0%
within 20 miles of our facility and
found

00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
found
 
00:43:21.359 --> 00:43:22.069 align:start position:0%
found
um

00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
two private firms that were looking for
 
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
the same type of position and it was
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
listed at a salary starting salary of
 
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
seventy to eighty thousand dollars
 
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
before benefit which we would
 
00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:34.730 align:start position:0%
before benefit which we would
um

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
expect to be approximately a hundred and
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars annually of
 
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
Burden employment costs to the county
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
additional costs and time are of a
 
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
significant concerns to us at the county
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
when you look at HB 232 the fiscal note
 
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
indicates that this will cause
 
00:43:56.809 --> 00:43:56.819 align:start position:0%
additional costs to the county and the
 
00:43:58.609 --> 00:43:58.619 align:start position:0%
full Financial impact may not be
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
identified until a compliant program is
 
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
written adopted and implemented
 
00:44:07.809 --> 00:44:07.819 align:start position:0%
HP 232 does not include an appropriation
 
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
for any costs incurred by local
 
00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.950 align:start position:0%
for any costs incurred by local
officials

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
60 days also too in terms of the
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
implementation is unreasonable it will
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
most likely take the county two to three
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
years to create and Implement a program
 
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
that we believe to be comply compliant
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
with OSHA 1910.
 
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
to do that a new program will require
 
00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.550 align:start position:0%
to do that a new program will require
staff

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
evaluation and development of our
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
current programs
 
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
engaging in outside cons consultant
 
00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
safety consultant to also evaluate our
 
00:44:44.569 --> 00:44:44.579 align:start position:0%
programs against the 1910 standard
 
00:44:47.569 --> 00:44:47.579 align:start position:0%
we would from a risk management point of
 
00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
view complete a risk assessment and
 
00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
engage legal counsel to make sure that
 
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
our program was compliant
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
and then conduct the expanded training
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
before every employee could be deemed to
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
be protected at the same level as 1910
 
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.150 align:start position:0%
be protected at the same level as 1910
OSHA

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
OSHA
 
00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
these points also don't consider the
 
00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
potential impacts on the physical
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
facilities and equipments that would
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
need to be acquired improved or replaced
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
as it would be a huge undertaking for us
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
at this time to even inspect our
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
facilities and Equipment against the
 
00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
current requirements
 
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:25.140 align:start position:0%
that would lead us to
 
00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
um not understanding the true impact of
 
00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
the passage of this legislation until it
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
was implemented
 
00:45:35.809 --> 00:45:35.819 align:start position:0%
so lastly I believe the intent of HB 232
 
00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
is ultimately to improve safety for New
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's public sector workers
 
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
the more common injuries to public
 
00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
employees result from student
 
00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
interactions law enforcement struggles
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
combative residents and slips and Falls
 
00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
due to weather conditions adopting 1910
 
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
OSHA as a whole does little to address
 
00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
these injury sources and creates an
 
00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
additional burden to taxpayers without
 
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
significant benefits from the rules and
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
regulations that are already in place
 
00:46:08.569 --> 00:46:08.579 align:start position:0%
HP 232 seeks out to replace out-of-date
 
00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations with a different
 
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
existing Federal standard but I believe
 
00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
this bill as written is not the right
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
solution and encourage the committee to
 
00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
explore Alternatives other than
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
holistically adopting uh 1910 OSHA
 
00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:27.180 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um questions from
 
00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:35.750 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um questions from
the

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.089 --> 00:46:38.099 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming for all your
 
00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
experience that you bring to the table
 
00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
we appreciate that
 
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
currently there are millions of people
 
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
covered by ocean
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
millions of people
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of companies that
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
have that are covered by OSHA including
 
00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
some states that currently enter the
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
state total
 
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
so my question is you mentioned various
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
agencies that you're currently various
 
00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
federal agencies that have jurisdiction
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
over some of your work
 
00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
and that was NFPA I think you mentioned
 
00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
that there was a couple of other that a
 
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
couple other teachers mentioned so those
 
00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
are federal standards and NFPA I was a
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
firefighter as was my colleague here uh
 
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
so we're familiar with the NFPA
 
00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
standards and
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
they have been game changers in a lot of
 
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
ways and many of the people in the
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
industry but it is a it is a National
 
00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
Standard and you have been able to been
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
able to go through and adapt your
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
operation to accommodate the changes as
 
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
they happen with some of these other
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
organizations so it's a question my
 
00:47:44.569 --> 00:47:44.579 align:start position:0%
question to you is it a matter of
 
00:47:44.579 --> 00:47:46.069 align:start position:0%
question to you is it a matter of
startup

00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
startup
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
the fear of starting up a new program
 
00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
and uh and not understanding completely
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
what the implications will be and what
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
the potential uh costs will be is that
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
so it's not so much at the standard
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
you're not post a standard is that
 
00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:03.710 align:start position:0%
you're not post a standard is that
correct

00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.809 align:start position:0%
correct
um

00:48:05.809 --> 00:48:05.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:05.819 --> 00:48:07.190 align:start position:0%
um
correct

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
um really so it's not necessarily it's
 
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
not lack of fear I will say that
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
um what it is it really it does boil
 
00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
down to the startup and it also boils
 
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
down to the fact the reference to other
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
Federal standards that we do comply with
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
um was meant to indicate that there's
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
already oversight on New Hampshire
 
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
public employees because of licensing
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
requirements and other regulations that
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
are out there so so
 
00:48:40.849 --> 00:48:40.859 align:start position:0%
um this would be above and beyond
 
00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
and duplicative in a lot of cases to
 
00:48:48.609 --> 00:48:48.619 align:start position:0%
statutes that we already comply with
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
the startup is a large concern because
 
00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:53.339 align:start position:0%
of the fact that
 
00:48:56.329 --> 00:48:56.339 align:start position:0%
um the county has not Fallen under OSHA
 
00:48:59.690 --> 00:48:59.700 align:start position:0%
requirements when our safety programs
 
00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:00.829 align:start position:0%
requirements when our safety programs
were

00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:03.380 align:start position:0%
developed they were developed
 
00:49:05.809 --> 00:49:05.819 align:start position:0%
distributed across the county where for
 
00:49:07.609 --> 00:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
example the nursing home developed their
 
00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:09.500 align:start position:0%
only their own safety program
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
Corrections is a different industry so
 
00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:14.420 align:start position:0%
they developed their own safety program
 
00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
and so to say that the county has one
 
00:49:20.089 --> 00:49:20.099 align:start position:0%
safety program isn't necessarily true
 
00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
versus a business that has one objective
 
00:49:25.809 --> 00:49:25.819 align:start position:0%
making widgets per se
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
has one operation or one purpose that
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
they are really considered that they
 
00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
have to consider for developing their
 
00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
programs and so we have several
 
00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:38.180 align:start position:0%
different programs within the county
 
00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:41.660 align:start position:0%
that we would have to redo
 
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
and take a look at how our operations
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
would change and so those safety
 
00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
programs were built to not
 
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
to comply with 1910 they were built to
 
00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:56.700 align:start position:0%
comply with local regulations and other
 
00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.790 align:start position:0%
comply with local regulations and other
um

00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
for example other nursing home receives
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and Medicare funds so they're
 
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
subject to the Center for Medicaid and
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services requirements for
 
00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
licensing and that's a whole different
 
00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
set of requirements that a lot of times
 
00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:13.740 align:start position:0%
are duplicative
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
and so what we look at is is the initial
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
cost to comply with 1910 is basically
 
00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
rewriting our program to meet a
 
00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
different standard that we feel is much
 
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
more onerous than the current standards
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
without providing much more benefit to
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
those within the county
 
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
of value if we were to move be able to
 
00:50:43.849 --> 00:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
move down the road with this is there
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
some value in and it may be shared by
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
the counties getting together
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
considering they offer I'm a
 
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough and uh you know so we do
 
00:50:56.809 --> 00:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
the nursing home we do the prison we do
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of those other services is it
 
00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:00.839 align:start position:0%
value and creating some kind of
 
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
um coordinating Council that would help
 
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
with implementation and maybe you could
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
share some of the costs associated with
 
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
this as well maybe there's just one
 
00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:12.059 align:start position:0%
expert you have to hire that helps all
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
these places so I'm just trying to
 
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
figure out how if the startup is a big
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
problem it's some way to make this a
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
more gentle
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
we actually do across the counties
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
confer quite a bit through the New
 
00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of counties there
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
are also subgroups of county level
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
leadership for the different divisions
 
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:37.140 align:start position:0%
within the county through nhac so we
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
share information quite a bit regarding
 
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:40.740 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures across the
 
00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
counties like that so I maybe it's a
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
little bit more informally than creating
 
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
a specific committee for something like
 
00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:52.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
I'll just I'll just reflect back on your
 
00:51:57.049 --> 00:51:57.059 align:start position:0%
comment of fear I think that's a strong
 
00:51:59.329 --> 00:51:59.339 align:start position:0%
word but carefully considering the
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
impact to our staff what does it mean to
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
current staff any potential to add
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
future staff coming from a HR standpoint
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
we've all talked about employment in the
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire unemployment
 
00:52:12.049 --> 00:52:12.059 align:start position:0%
rates and finding staff so any
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
consideration for All Counties to have
 
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
to restructure or build a health and
 
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
safety program that would require
 
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
specialized trainers to be hired by all
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
of us there's some fear in that do those
 
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
people exist for all of us to access
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
that's a component to the conversation
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
also we carefully consider our
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
compliance and relationship I do like to
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
think it's a partnership with Department
 
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
of Labor but we in Human Resources
 
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
that's the the bread and butter of what
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
we do is compliance with Department of
 
00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
Labor so you can tell we've carefully
 
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
scrutinized what this would mean for us
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
financially and on staff and then if we
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
think about that work that needs to be
 
00:52:48.829 --> 00:52:48.839 align:start position:0%
done do we have the staff in the state
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
to help us do that work to be compliant
 
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
and if if so does it exist in the
 
00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
timeline we're talking about so just to
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
add that in is there some fear in there
 
00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
that these people exist for us to access
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
right away yeah in Human Resources
 
00:53:02.329 --> 00:53:02.339 align:start position:0%
there's always fear that do our staff
 
00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:03.900 align:start position:0%
exist right now
 
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
um so I'll just add that but thank you
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
for all the work I know from
 
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County's perspective how
 
00:53:11.329 --> 00:53:11.339 align:start position:0%
difficult it is the challenges that
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
you're facing Staffing and all those
 
00:53:14.329 --> 00:53:14.339 align:start position:0%
other things so thank you for our
 
00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
YouTube well one thing I would like to
 
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
uh acknowledge is and this is something
 
00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
that we discussed at length earlier in
 
00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
the year
 
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
um the Implement implementation date UH
 
00:53:27.049 --> 00:53:27.059 align:start position:0%
60 days
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
um is too soon and I think
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
um our committee has acknowledged that
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
we've not uh pinned down an exact
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
effective date yet but uh
 
00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
um it's it will not well
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it will not be 60 days it'll be
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
substantially longer than that to give
 
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
give the time that folks will need to
 
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
get ready so
 
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah 1910 is a pretty length the set
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
of regulations and so from a
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
implementation and risk management point
 
00:53:59.089 --> 00:53:59.099 align:start position:0%
of view it would require us as a county
 
00:54:03.250 --> 00:54:03.260 align:start position:0%
to go line by line to determine how we
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
comply and how we train our people to
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
understand and comply and make sure that
 
00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
and just ensure how we do that with a
 
00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:13.750 align:start position:0%
and just ensure how we do that with a
program

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
takes time to evaluate let alone uh
 
00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
change and implement
 
00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
so we appreciate you taking a look at
 
00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:34.140 align:start position:0%
I think what we'll do is get more County
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
people up uh sort of run
 
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
run throughout the county people and
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps in the Department of Labor can
 
00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
respond to some of the uh issues that
 
00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
are raised okay thank you good morning
 
00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
my name is David Ross and I am the
 
00:54:50.569 --> 00:54:50.579 align:start position:0%
nursing home administrator for
 
00:54:52.849 --> 00:54:52.859 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County Nursing Home thank
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
you for making the time today for us to
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
come and speak with you I won't repeat
 
00:54:58.970 --> 00:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
any of the information that was shared
 
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
by Sullivan County
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
I think they were extremely articulate
 
00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
in defining the issues but I wanted to
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
address a couple of key things for us we
 
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
are not
 
00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
um so concerned I think we're fearful of
 
00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
new regulations we deal with new
 
00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:16.140 align:start position:0%
regulations all of the time
 
00:55:17.569 --> 00:55:17.579 align:start position:0%
um I think what we're concerned about
 
00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
for us at least in the nursing home
 
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
sector is unnecessary regulation in the
 
00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
burdens that it that it creates
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
we do have many standards that we have
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
to comply with NFPA being a big one CMS
 
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
regulations and by reference many OSHA
 
00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
standards already many of the references
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
that we have on follow industry
 
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
standards of practice that we have to
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
meet and we by reference then defer to
 
00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
OSHA guidelines for implementation of
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
many of those things
 
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
the pieces that aren't included in those
 
00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:54.260 align:start position:0%
cross references are the specific
 
00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:56.700 align:start position:0%
references to qualified individuals
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
training and documentation requirements
 
00:56:02.329 --> 00:56:02.339 align:start position:0%
um that are specified in the 1910
 
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
standards which are overburdensome for
 
00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:05.930 align:start position:0%
standards which are overburdensome for
us

00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:07.980 align:start position:0%
um and aren't going to achieve any of
 
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
the safety objectives of this proposed
 
00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
legislation and those do come at an
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
additional cost for us Sullivan County
 
00:56:17.809 --> 00:56:17.819 align:start position:0%
is absolutely correct that it will
 
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
require at least one if not more than
 
00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
one new management position established
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to both develop and evaluate
 
00:56:30.049 --> 00:56:30.059 align:start position:0%
and monitor compliance with these new
 
00:56:33.049 --> 00:56:33.059 align:start position:0%
standards it is a voluminous job prior
 
00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
to coming to Hillsborough County I
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
worked in the private sector and in many
 
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
different organizations and there were
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
entire departments dedicated to this
 
00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:42.670 align:start position:0%
entire departments dedicated to this
very

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
facet of operations to manage risk
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
management and OSHA compliance and these
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
regulations are voluminous
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
labor is a big issue for us and
 
00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
dedicating an additional time to the
 
00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
training resources that are required
 
00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
here both from finding qualified
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
trainers having to pay for them but more
 
00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
importantly dedicating time for our
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
limited Personnel to engage in this
 
00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
training in a meaningful way is going to
 
00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
be hard for us to accomplish we are
 
00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:16.140 align:start position:0%
struggling very realistically with
 
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
Workforce challenges and to add to the
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
burden of additional training over and
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
above what we're already doing
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
is very very concerning for us at this
 
00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
time and I just really want to emphasize
 
00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
that point
 
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
um I do know at the beginning of today's
 
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:38.339 align:start position:0%
session you did reference that this
 
00:57:40.849 --> 00:57:40.859 align:start position:0%
legislation does not impose OSHA
 
00:57:40.859 --> 00:57:42.650 align:start position:0%
legislation does not impose OSHA
enforcement

00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
um on on the state or on the
 
00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
municipalities or counties I will point
 
00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
out that throughout each of the
 
00:57:52.849 --> 00:57:52.859 align:start position:0%
subsections of the 1910 standard it does
 
00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
Grant authority of access for the
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
Secretary of
 
00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
um the of a Russia to be able to have
 
00:58:02.089 --> 00:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
access to information and I would be
 
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
concerned that there has to be some
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
language in our own statute that
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
withdraws that or removes that
 
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
um so I will point out the subparts Z
 
00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.970 align:start position:0%
um so I will point out the subparts Z
specifically

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:15.980 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:17.530 align:start position:0%
specifically
1910.1020

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:17.540 align:start position:0%
1910.1020
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
addresses access unto employee medical
 
00:58:23.809 --> 00:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
records for exposure events
 
00:58:23.819 --> 00:58:24.530 align:start position:0%
records for exposure events
um

00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
so it has to be make sure that we're not
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
opening a door for an enforcement action
 
00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:33.540 align:start position:0%
that was unintended as we're trying to
 
00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
incorporate safety standards in here
 
00:58:38.329 --> 00:58:38.339 align:start position:0%
implementation timeline is critical for
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
us I appreciate your recognition that 60
 
00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
days is not reasonable and that we would
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
have to look at a longer time timeline
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
um I applaud that acknowledgment and we
 
00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
would definitely be looking for a three
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
to five year implementation period would
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
be my recommendation for us
 
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.309 align:start position:0%
be my recommendation for us
um

00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:00.730 --> 00:59:00.740 align:start position:0%
you did ask if counties could combine
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
resources to create maybe one position
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
that would be helped to develop these
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
things I think you all recognize as
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
Representatives that each County
 
00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
operates individually
 
00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
um and all of those operations are
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
really dedicated and directed by budgets
 
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:19.740 align:start position:0%
and and finance that one we struggle
 
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
with one elected body binding a
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
subsequent elected body let alone
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
um other counties binding other
 
00:59:31.609 --> 00:59:31.619 align:start position:0%
um the obligations or requirements of
 
00:59:33.309 --> 00:59:33.319 align:start position:0%
separate counties
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
similarly municipalities are some are
 
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
affected by this regulation so it it
 
00:59:40.930 --> 00:59:40.940 align:start position:0%
would really be very different for us to
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
suggest that we would pull resources to
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
be able to create regulations that would
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
impact any individual County alone that
 
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
each one is going to want to make their
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
own specifically I can assure you that
 
00:59:55.609 --> 00:59:55.619 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County would want to make
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:59:59.150 --> 00:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
um as you see in many of the statutes
 
01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
already that there's specific reference
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
to Hillsborough County alone so
 
01:00:06.049 --> 01:00:06.059 align:start position:0%
um that's just just to share I'm happy
 
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions that you have
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate your time
 
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
I we all serve on County delegations yes
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
we kind of get it I know you do I know
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:26.460 align:start position:0%
hi Hi how are you
 
01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:27.470 align:start position:0%
hi Hi how are you
um

01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:30.109 --> 01:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
I I think it's important to uh and I've
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
run this by the chair but I think it's
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
important to note
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
that there was created many years ago a
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
Public Employee safety act
 
01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
I have the file right here in fact I
 
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
helped write it great somehow it got
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
absorbed into the Department of Labor I
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
mean Nick haven't quite figured out how
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
that happened but he got absorbed but
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
the fact is that when when these
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
when this stuff was created
 
01:00:58.609 --> 01:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
there was a whole infrastructure that
 
01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
exist that we put into place that
 
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
provided support uh to the local
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
communities to uh businesses all
 
01:01:07.849 --> 01:01:07.859 align:start position:0%
throughout the state there with if you
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
look back on the law there are all kinds
 
01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
of things that the Department of Labor
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
was able to do indeed when we
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
implemented some of this language when
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
he used it so the question I have is can
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor be if we would
 
01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:23.220 align:start position:0%
be able to fund them better
 
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
would they be a resource for people like
 
01:01:27.370 --> 01:01:27.380 align:start position:0%
the Hillsborough County
 
01:01:30.049 --> 01:01:30.059 align:start position:0%
the nursing home or the prison or the
 
01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
other counties because we did this
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
before it's not this is not it's done
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
some of this work before
 
01:01:41.089 --> 01:01:41.099 align:start position:0%
so how can we help I guess and that's
 
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
I I guess it I
 
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
for me my response to that is to ask is
 
01:01:51.049 --> 01:01:51.059 align:start position:0%
help really needed
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
um I believe that the structure that we
 
01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
have now with the federal oversight that
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
we have and now at least in the nursing
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
home section sector the annual
 
01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
inspection process that we have we have
 
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
life safety inspections we have health
 
01:02:08.089 --> 01:02:08.099 align:start position:0%
and safety inspections and if needed we
 
01:02:10.849 --> 01:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
have the Department of Labor to be
 
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
taking a look at safety programs as well
 
01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that additional help is
 
01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:19.210 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that additional help is
needed

01:02:19.210 --> 01:02:19.220 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
and I think that in implementing this
 
01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
would actually be an unfunded mandate
 
01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
for us at on the county level for us to
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
incur additional costs
 
01:02:33.289 --> 01:02:33.299 align:start position:0%
um for services that aren't truly
 
01:02:33.299 --> 01:02:35.470 align:start position:0%
um for services that aren't truly
necessary

01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:02:37.849 --> 01:02:37.859 align:start position:0%
what one thing I would remind the
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
committee of is that providing the
 
01:02:42.130 --> 01:02:42.140 align:start position:0%
department with
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
better funding is not really an issue
 
01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
the the Department of Labor is
 
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
self-funded so and and frankly they are
 
01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
presently sending money back to the
 
01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
general fund so it um if
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
I'll just leave it at that it's just the
 
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.230 align:start position:0%
I'll just leave it at that it's just the
reality

01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:12.530 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
would the department like to weigh in
 
01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
and especially with regard to the issue
 
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
we heard we heard some concerns about
 
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.010 align:start position:0%
we heard we heard some concerns about
um

01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
what what a qualified trainer would be
 
01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
and so forth and I had a conversation
 
01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:39.059 align:start position:0%
with Mr Gardner yesterday
 
01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
um and uh perhaps you could
 
01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:45.299 align:start position:0%
provide some backgrounds yes of course
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
um so as it relates to a qualified
 
01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
person I would say initially that
 
01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:50.690 align:start position:0%
person I would say initially that
um

01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:54.299 align:start position:0%
obviously with today's current standards
 
01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
if somebody is deemed unqualified that's
 
01:03:58.970 --> 01:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
training we would have issue with that
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's something we would cite
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
um I recognize that that's kind of
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
circular reasoning in that sense but you
 
01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
know there are two kind of different
 
01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
standards there for what makes a
 
01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
qualified person under OSHA standards at
 
01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:11.339 align:start position:0%
least if they're certified which I would
 
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
take to mean you know if somebody's a
 
01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
plumber electrician do they have the
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
requisite licenses that's a very simple
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
test Fair obviously somebody who is not
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
an electrician should probably not be
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
training somebody on electrical work
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's an easy citation the other one
 
01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
that is a little bit more amorphous and
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
Broad I would recognize is the second
 
01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:30.299 align:start position:0%
piece of the test of whether they have
 
01:04:33.049 --> 01:04:33.059 align:start position:0%
the experience necessary again though I
 
01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
think all of us in general can say is
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
this person qualified to do this or not
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
do they have any experience what's the
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
level of experience there so as far as
 
01:04:44.809 --> 01:04:44.819 align:start position:0%
the qualified person piece goes again we
 
01:04:47.089 --> 01:04:47.099 align:start position:0%
as an apartment generally in today's
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
standards it's something that we would
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
recognize too we would ask who is
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
training saying why are they training
 
01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
what are their qualifications again do
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
they hold the requisite licensure if
 
01:04:59.150 --> 01:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
there is any licensure involved there so
 
01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
again it's something that we'd be
 
01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:02.700 align:start position:0%
looking at anyways I would say the OSHA
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
standard kind of just goes to Define
 
01:05:06.289 --> 01:05:06.299 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
um again recognizing it is rather Broad
 
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
in its sense but obviously it's
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
something that OSHA has been
 
01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
implementing for years and it seems to
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
work for them but again it's something
 
01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
that we would look at anyways under
 
01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:19.859 align:start position:0%
today's standards
 
01:05:19.859 --> 01:05:23.030 align:start position:0%
today's standards
please

01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh just for my understanding did you say
 
01:05:29.809 --> 01:05:29.819 align:start position:0%
that if an electrician has a license or
 
01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
a plumber or gas sitter has a license
 
01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:34.140 align:start position:0%
that they're qualified to train for
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
safety in that field is that what I'm
 
01:05:39.289 --> 01:05:39.299 align:start position:0%
hearing you say I would so I apologize
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
let me go back so I would say it's not
 
01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
100 a guarantee we would still look at
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
it on a case-by-case basis what I would
 
01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
say though is if somebody is training in
 
01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:51.059 align:start position:0%
one of those fields where generally to
 
01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
do the work licensure is required that
 
01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
would probably be you know a key piece
 
01:05:56.329 --> 01:05:56.339 align:start position:0%
that we would look to see if somebody
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
does have that again if somebody is
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
training somebody on specifically how to
 
01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
perform electrical work if they did not
 
01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
have an electrician's license I would
 
01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
say that'd be a major red flag that they
 
01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
might not be qualified from the get-go
 
01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
so again it's something we would look to
 
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say it's necessarily a prima
 
01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
fascia case that if they have the
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
license they're deemed qualified again
 
01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
Case by case basis for anything like
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.529 --> 01:06:27.539 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
uh the the current Law requires that
 
01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:33.299 align:start position:0%
each Public Employee
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
employer in the state file a safety plan
 
01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Labor now when
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
that was originally passed I think was
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
every year and then it was modified I
 
01:06:44.809 --> 01:06:44.819 align:start position:0%
think it was every three years and now I
 
01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
I don't think they have to file it again
 
01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at some safety plans that
 
01:06:54.289 --> 01:06:54.299 align:start position:0%
were filed in 1978
 
01:06:57.890 --> 01:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
um and revised of 2005. so under the
 
01:06:59.690 --> 01:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
current law
 
01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:00.770 align:start position:0%
current law
um

01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
what is the Department of Safety doing
 
01:07:05.450 --> 01:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
when it comes to these plans do
 
01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
employers have some responsibility to
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
update these plans and if that's the
 
01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
case who's doing it
 
01:07:15.049 --> 01:07:15.059 align:start position:0%
thank you so under this law is the
 
01:07:17.089 --> 01:07:17.099 align:start position:0%
current laws they have to update them at
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
a minimum every two years there's also a
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
requirement the jlmc me quarterly so if
 
01:07:25.069 --> 01:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
they're meeting quarterly and they're
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
notified they're being you know made
 
01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
aware of dangerous or unsafe conditions
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
or concerns the expectation when we do a
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
safety audit of their business we look
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
at those minutes and if they're not
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
addressing it or or revising their plan
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
based on a legitimate safety concern or
 
01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
not even conducting an investigation
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
that is something that we would discuss
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
with them
 
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
um so although the bare minimum
 
01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
qualification you know is that they
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
update them every two years
 
01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
um they are expected to address safety
 
01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
concerns in the immediate and when we do
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
our audit we are looking at their safety
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
program as well to make sure that it
 
01:08:02.809 --> 01:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
does have some notification on it that
 
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
it was updated within the last two years
 
01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh in addition to looking at the jlmc
 
01:08:08.329 --> 01:08:08.339 align:start position:0%
minutes that they are required to
 
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
maintain at these quarterly meetings to
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
see what they're overseeing what their
 
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
concerns are and just the current plan
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
the the meetings that you're talking
 
01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
about the quarterly meetings are the
 
01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
joint Labor Management committee means
 
01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
correct joint Loss Management yes so
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
it's the employees any employees that
 
01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
was created under the law so
 
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
when is the last time can you give us
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
some sense of how many audits you did of
 
01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
the safety plans and when the last time
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
is that you
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
so every time we go and conduct an audit
 
01:08:46.249 --> 01:08:46.259 align:start position:0%
we are looking at their safety plan
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
so um you know so it's it's it's every
 
01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
every audit we are looking at as part of
 
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
the checklist
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
um do they have an updated safety plan
 
01:08:58.249 --> 01:08:58.259 align:start position:0%
so you do have to file the safety
 
01:08:59.689 --> 01:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
summary that they've certified that
 
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
they've updated but they should be doing
 
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
it every two years and if we catch you
 
01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
we're going to cite you on that so
 
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
so every again every you're saying every
 
01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
employee should be updating the plan to
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
be two years correct and where does that
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
go so that is maintained with the
 
01:09:15.769 --> 01:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
employer and distributed amongst the
 
01:09:15.779 --> 01:09:16.789 align:start position:0%
employer and distributed amongst the
employees

01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
so it needs to be accessible to the
 
01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:20.150 align:start position:0%
so it needs to be accessible to the
employees

01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
so the employees but you don't get
 
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
copies of that no we do not used to
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh we used to get the safety summary
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
form so they didn't actually give us the
 
01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
entire plan some plans can be quite
 
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
volume so for instance Hillsborough
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
County plan will be multiple volumes it
 
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
would be the nursing home plan the
 
01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
corrections plan and you know county
 
01:09:42.769 --> 01:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
attorney's plan you know multiple
 
01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:43.910 align:start position:0%
attorney's plan you know multiple
volumes

01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
volumes
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
um they would provide us a summary of
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
each one of their locations
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
well just just for the record I pulled I
 
01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
did a
 
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
um right to no request at Hillsborough
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
County plants and I can share those with
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
them and they're not
 
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:11.689 --> 01:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
do we have others who um would like to
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
provide input
 
01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:27.729 align:start position:0%
provide input
please

01:10:27.729 --> 01:10:27.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
um the Director of Human Resources for
 
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
the city of Concord so I'm representing
 
01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
the public sector as far as
 
01:10:37.729 --> 01:10:37.739 align:start position:0%
municipalities go
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
in the city of Concord we do not have
 
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
the school district but many
 
01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
municipalities do have school districts
 
01:10:47.930 --> 01:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
under their uh political subsection the
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
reason I bring that up is and Sullivan
 
01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
County did present this during their
 
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
testimony school districts do offer a
 
01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
lot of our injuries within the public
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
sector in that Municipal subsection
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh I I'm representing the city of
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
Concord because I believe that the 1910
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
OSHA regulations
 
01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
will not address worker safety which is
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
essential to us I am a member of our
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
joint Loss Management committee we do
 
01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
meet every six weeks we have a very
 
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
robust and active committee that looks
 
01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
at near missed incidents and it looks to
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
craft training and prevention and
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
communication before incidents increase
 
01:11:30.770 --> 01:11:30.780 align:start position:0%
in severity or in um
 
01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:32.030 align:start position:0%
in severity or in um
frequency

01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
frequency
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
and I think OSHA would handcuff that
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
effort because it would instead
 
01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
Implement standards that already exists
 
01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
and are very robust as you've heard and
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
stipulate training that has to occur in
 
01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
compliance that has to occur
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
um whereas now we can be more Nimble and
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
flexible with the training that we see
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
needing to happen
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
one of the things I did to prepare for
 
01:11:58.970 --> 01:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
today was to go to primex which offers
 
01:12:02.689 --> 01:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
our workers compensation coverage and
 
01:12:05.149 --> 01:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
they provided me with
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
um the most
 
01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
frequent injuries that are seen in the
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
public sector and municipalities and
 
01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:14.540 align:start position:0%
those include
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
injuries from student interactions
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
police struggles human and animal bites
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
combative residents and slips and falls
 
01:12:24.169 --> 01:12:24.179 align:start position:0%
on ice and snow and you did hear that
 
01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
from Sullivan County as opposed to the
 
01:12:30.729 --> 01:12:30.739 align:start position:0%
most common OSHA citations which are
 
01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
fall protection hazardous communication
 
01:12:36.729 --> 01:12:36.739 align:start position:0%
that's your safety data sheets
 
01:12:38.810 --> 01:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
respiratory protection ladders
 
01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
scaffolding lockout tag out and powered
 
01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
industrial trucks commonly known as
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
forklifts we feel if you look at those
 
01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
two sections those two categories OSHA
 
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
versus in the public sector what you're
 
01:12:54.649 --> 01:12:54.659 align:start position:0%
seeing for injuries there's not a lot of
 
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
overlap where the OSHA standards would
 
01:12:58.610 --> 01:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
have addressed those particular injuries
 
01:13:00.649 --> 01:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
and helped to prevent them and that's
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
really what our focus is with worker
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
safety is to look at prevention
 
01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:05.870 align:start position:0%
safety is to look at prevention
um

01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
you know I worked in the private sector
 
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
for 10 years at McLean in Kentucky so I
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
was subject to OSHA as well as the
 
01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:16.140 align:start position:0%
Federal Motor Carrier safety regulations
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
for our CDL Drivers and I suffered a
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
workplace fatality of an employee and
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's something that definitely changes
 
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
you it makes you look at things
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
differently makes you wish that you
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
could go back in time and do things
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
differently so I don't want to appear
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
that safety is not of the utmost concern
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
to me as an HR Director but I do think
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
the programs that we have in place and
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor's current safety
 
01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
policies provide the framework in order
 
01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
to provide a safe environment and to
 
01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
allow us to be flexible and responsive
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
to the incidents we see
 
01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.070 align:start position:0%
to the incidents we see
um

01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
I think that there are other ways that
 
01:13:57.290 --> 01:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
we could provide safety to our workers
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
in the public sector besides adopting
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
1910 wholesale I think that it would
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
require some more time and maybe carving
 
01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
out what you find to be the most
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
important pieces of that it's been
 
01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
stated by the counties very eloquently
 
01:14:15.649 --> 01:14:15.659 align:start position:0%
how much the training would impact us
 
01:14:17.810 --> 01:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
trying to be compliant with it when it
 
01:14:20.410 --> 01:14:20.420 align:start position:0%
might not necessarily even impact those
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
workers safety
 
01:14:28.189 --> 01:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
do we have others who would like to
 
01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:42.709 align:start position:0%
do we have others who would like to
testify

01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
anything further from the Department
 
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
that you'd like to uh
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to reiterate I'm a new
 
01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
attorney Gardener had already stated as
 
01:15:27.649 --> 01:15:27.659 align:start position:0%
such earlier the last test time we
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
provided testimony we already do provide
 
01:15:32.770 --> 01:15:32.780 align:start position:0%
training so we we are that Central
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
agency that you were talking about
 
01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
earlier we provide pencil audits at
 
01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
request of the employers when we do that
 
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
although it does generate a report
 
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's you know and a timeline for
 
01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
compliance or not levying fine holding
 
01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
fines above anyone's head
 
01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:49.189 align:start position:0%
fines above anyone's head
um

01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
we're just we're you know it's the other
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
thing that we do provide is um
 
01:15:55.490 --> 01:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
you know regular like I just did a
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
training yesterday for municipalities
 
01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
with respect to setting up a safety plan
 
01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
um so I you know that is something that
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
we do I'm not afraid of hard work I just
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
want to make that clear
 
01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
um you know it will make it in the sense
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
that explaining more laws will require
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
more staff more trained staff higher
 
01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
trained staff in the sense that they
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
have to be able to
 
01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
um review and understand and explain uh
 
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
in common language federal laws
 
01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:22.189 align:start position:0%
in common language federal laws
um

01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:24.900 align:start position:0%
such that people can understand them
 
01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
um there is I know it is true what she
 
01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
said and as heard earlier testimony uh
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
right now people that are coming out of
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
school uh with understanding of both of
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
safety state level and OSHA are
 
01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
graduating uh and can require and demand
 
01:16:43.130 --> 01:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
salaries beginning at seventy thousand
 
01:16:45.530 --> 01:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
dollars uh and that is going to be very
 
01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
hard for us to retain
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
um especially given that they're all
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
going to be interested in picking from
 
01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
that same pool of applicants
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted to bring that to
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
your attention as well I did speak with
 
01:16:59.570 --> 01:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
Keene State University that would their
 
01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
um head administrator of the safety plan
 
01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
of their of their safety program
 
01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
and that is what they're commanding
 
01:17:07.729 --> 01:17:07.739 align:start position:0%
before benefits and they do get
 
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
comparable benefits uh to what the state
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
offers that usually is our selling point
 
01:17:15.169 --> 01:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
the work-life balance and our benefit
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
package our wonderful benefit package
 
01:17:20.090 --> 01:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
um and that it does not I don't have the
 
01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
edge given the current economy yeah and
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
and our understanding from last week was
 
01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:27.260 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
public sector employers would likely be
 
01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
leaning on the Department of Labor to
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
provide some implementation
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
um assistance so um that's
 
01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
something that I think is important and
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
helpful correct we would be creating my
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
action plan if this bill were to pass
 
01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
would be to create a consultation type
 
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
service would increase would need
 
01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
increased Staffing to help people
 
01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:54.110 align:start position:0%
increased Staffing to help people
transition

01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
transition
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
um and track all of these cases
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
um because they're they're all going to
 
01:18:01.729 --> 01:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
have different needs and we do have
 
01:18:01.739 --> 01:18:03.590 align:start position:0%
have different needs and we do have
um currently

01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
um currently
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
um we do have discretion with the amount
 
01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
of time we give people to bring
 
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
themselves into compliance we don't
 
01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
expect compliance overnight we are a
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable agency we expect just a good
 
01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
faith effort yeah and as I was
 
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
as we get into this discussion of
 
01:18:22.810 --> 01:18:22.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
the date will probably not be five years
 
01:18:25.679 --> 01:18:26.930 align:start position:0%
the date will probably not be five years
out

01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:18:29.169 --> 01:18:29.179 align:start position:0%
um that that's probably a bit too far
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
but the anticipation would be that
 
01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
whenever the date is it will not be a um
 
01:18:38.689 --> 01:18:38.699 align:start position:0%
a starting gun that goes off that says
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
as of today everyone's going to be
 
01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.570 align:start position:0%
as of today everyone's going to be
perfect

01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
um that's not the way you folks operate
 
01:18:45.169 --> 01:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
this is not how it operates currently
 
01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
do give them a reasonable amount of time
 
01:18:57.709 --> 01:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
we'd understand budgetary constraints
 
01:19:00.169 --> 01:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
now the excuse can't always be we you
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
know yes we knew about the problem but
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
now we got to start saving money for it
 
01:19:06.169 --> 01:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
but there's
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
but we do communicate with them and we
 
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
we ask for updates and just as long as
 
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
we see that a person is making a good
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
faith effort to bring their business
 
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
into current compliance we're willing to
 
01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
work with any employer
 
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
can I thank you for that
 
01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:22.070 align:start position:0%
can I thank you for that
um

01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:30.169 --> 01:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
you know I
 
01:19:32.330 --> 01:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
I heard a number of different people
 
01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
come from different agencies and talk
 
01:19:35.689 --> 01:19:35.699 align:start position:0%
about different standards that they
 
01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:37.140 align:start position:0%
currently use and
 
01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:38.630 align:start position:0%
currently use and
and

01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:41.209 --> 01:19:41.219 align:start position:0%
the question I have is it
 
01:19:44.209 --> 01:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
the is there a role at the State plays
 
01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
in the sense that
 
01:19:48.649 --> 01:19:48.659 align:start position:0%
we have a Target standard that everybody
 
01:19:50.689 --> 01:19:50.699 align:start position:0%
is moving towards
 
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
and and I think my sense is that that's
 
01:19:54.610 --> 01:19:54.620 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do establish this
 
01:19:58.010 --> 01:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
this target standard that people so
 
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
across the board whether you go from
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County Hillsborough County that
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
there is consistency in terms of what
 
01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:06.860 align:start position:0%
the what the language
 
01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
is for various standards that that we
 
01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:12.350 align:start position:0%
is for various standards that that we
apply

01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
apply
 
01:20:15.169 --> 01:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
because the the impression I get and
 
01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
this is difficult I understand this is
 
01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
difficult to to manage but
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
um is there a value in having a central
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
standard that people operate under
 
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
you know for instance if they're
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
receiving federal funds they're going to
 
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
have to work under different standards
 
01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
um so and you know so that we do
 
01:20:41.149 --> 01:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
currently have a set standard that
 
01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
everyone is supposed to follow and you
 
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
know the I think the goal of this panel
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
is to raise the standard
 
01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:48.229 align:start position:0%
is to raise the standard
um

01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
and so is there value to have you know
 
01:20:53.689 --> 01:20:53.699 align:start position:0%
assessment yes we do currently have that
 
01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
um but I don't think everyone is always
 
01:20:58.130 --> 01:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
going to have uh freedom from these
 
01:21:00.649 --> 01:21:00.659 align:start position:0%
outside agencies there's always going to
 
01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.689 --> 01:21:11.699 align:start position:0%
millions of employers and people around
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
the around the United States is covered
 
01:21:16.729 --> 01:21:16.739 align:start position:0%
by OSHA and employees all over the place
 
01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
have been able to manage change which is
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
what we're suggesting here and to keep
 
01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
it standard that's going to be
 
01:21:26.630 --> 01:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to age what the what the so I
 
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
I hope that we can get to a place
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
where public employees are covered by
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
the same laws as federal employees the
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
same protections as the federal
 
01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
employees and the in the private sector
 
01:21:40.010 --> 01:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
employees I hope we can get to that
 
01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
place which is the point of this whole
 
01:21:44.810 --> 01:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
exercise so
 
01:21:47.630 --> 01:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:21:50.930 --> 01:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:53.689 --> 01:21:53.699 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else uh here who would
 
01:21:58.669 --> 01:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
we will be meeting uh next week again at
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
10 A.M on Thursday
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
um to uh
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
continue getting input I'm not
 
01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
suggesting you folks come back and do it
 
01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:11.450 align:start position:0%
suggesting you folks come back and do it
again

01:22:11.450 --> 01:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
um but I expect there will be others who
 
01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
have not yet had a chance and the whole
 
01:22:18.610 --> 01:22:18.620 align:start position:0%
purpose of doing this the reason we
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
retained the bill was because some folks
 
01:22:22.490 --> 01:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
said we
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
um would have liked to have provided
 
01:22:28.130 --> 01:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
input and I'm glad to be getting it
 
01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
um and we will continue doing that uh
 
01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
for a little while now so thank you for
 
01:22:56.630 --> 01:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
