00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and share butler
 
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
i am here in my home office in hart's
 
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
13 here
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.230 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh today we are going to as we did
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday discuss and vote on uh the
 
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
remaining bills uh that we
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
referred for interim study
 
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.629 align:start position:0%
referred for interim study
um

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
and we will have that discussion among
 
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh the committee members open it up to
 
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
the public and i understand there are a
 
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
number of people who may want to comment
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
on our bills
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
um and uh then we will make a motion and
 
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
vote on each bill
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
as after it is discussed
 
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
and uh let's begin with house bill 462
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
which is relative to digital electronic
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
product repair
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
and uh representative williams you can
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
raise your hand um today uh in order to
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
make the
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
identification of people who want to
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
speak easier
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
and at this moment i don't see any
 
00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:09.670 align:start position:0%
and at this moment i don't see any
hands-raised

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
hands-raised
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
representative indrik
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
do you have
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts about
 
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:16.110 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.309 align:start position:0%
this bill
[Music]

00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
sure mr jarrett thank you for
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
allowing me the opportunity to speak
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
as i'm sure many of the committee
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
members will recall i actually wrote the
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
committee reports
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
on this earlier and we had some
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
residents i
 
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:35.039 align:start position:0%
certainly did about
 
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
the breadth of this bill as written
 
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
and some of this potential security and
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
privacy issues uh as well as issues
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
related to digital rights management and
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
a few other
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
uh more technical questions uh all that
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
being said uh i think many of us and i
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
know myself certainly included
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
had a lot of sympathy
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
with the idea and the intent behind this
 
00:08:58.959 --> 00:08:59.750 align:start position:0%
with the idea and the intent behind this
bill

00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
and i personally think
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
it would be worthy to explore
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
a more limited bill
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps one that targets say personal
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
uh portable electronic devices uh at a
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
certain price point or above that would
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
limit the application of the bill
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
potentially also to
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
portions of those device that are more
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
likely to fail
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
such as the screen charging port
 
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.829 align:start position:0%
such as the screen charging port
or

00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:28.949 align:start position:0%
or
other

00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:28.959 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
typical failure points
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
that are real sore points for new
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire consumers
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
and that it seems could potentially
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
balance some of the security concerns uh
 
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
as well as some of the other
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and um i would uh
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
support that and i'm disappointed that
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be running again
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
um and uh as as you know neither am i so
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
neither of us will be able to
 
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh put that bill in but i hope you will
 
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
help me
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
in finding
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
the advocates that
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
would consider
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
supporting that
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
process as you know
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
business up here in
 
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
my valley um
 
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.310 align:start position:0%
my valley um
that

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
does provide
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
services for personal portable
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
electronic devices um including uh
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
iphones um even though that is
 
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.509 align:start position:0%
iphones um even though that is
somewhat

00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:35.350 align:start position:0%
somewhat
illegal

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.470 align:start position:0%
illegal
and

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
they have a
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
thriving business and it just doesn't
 
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:42.410 align:start position:0%
make sense not to
 
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:43.750 align:start position:0%
make sense not to
[Music]

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
find a way to
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
support that
 
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.970 align:start position:0%
support that
business

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:48.980 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
care butler i appreciate it
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that um i was grateful
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
to learn more about this year and i too
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
visited um a couple of the stores or
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
retail operations that are repairing
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
some of the portable devices one here in
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
portsmouth and was very impressed and um
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
what representative endrick said about
 
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
you know tailoring this bill a little
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
bit more to some of the
 
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.509 align:start position:0%
bit more to some of the
uh

00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
specific needs that we did here from um
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
you know new hampshire citizens
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
very interested and would like to see
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
this go forward and working with all the
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to kind of make it
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
good for consumers but perhaps something
 
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.030 align:start position:0%
good for consumers but perhaps something
that

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
they can get on board with thank you
 
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
thank you representative macbeth
 
00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:40.829 align:start position:0%
thank you representative macbeth
representative

00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
williams thank you mr chairman um so i
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
would agree with what everybody said so
 
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
far i think supporting our local small
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
businesses is always important
 
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.310 align:start position:0%
businesses is always important
um

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
i i recognize though that this is a
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
something of a national effort
 
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
some of the people who spoke uh both for
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
and against uh were not from new
 
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.269 align:start position:0%
and against uh were not from new
hampshire

00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
and and i would hope that we would work
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
with this national group
 
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:08.949 align:start position:0%
with this national group
um

00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'd rather not see new hampshire be the
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
pioneers i think that's kind of where we
 
00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
were before
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully you know this will get through
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh some other legislation some other
 
00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:23.509 align:start position:0%
uh some other legislation some other
legislators

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:25.110 align:start position:0%
legislators
before

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
we do it again just so that we can
 
00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:29.030 align:start position:0%
we do it again just so that we can
maybe

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
say hey other states are doing it as
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
well because i do think
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know there's no difference between
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
how new hampshire
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
wants to handle its
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
device repair and how
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
some other state
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative hunt
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so did california
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
pass something or didn't wasn't there a
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
referendum or something that california
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
passed something am i remembering the
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
right issue here
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of it
 
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative endrick are you do you
 
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.269 align:start position:0%
representative endrick are you do you
know

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
i believe representative hunt might
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
actually be thinking about uh something
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
related to hb 1680 which we will discuss
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
later with regard to privacy and
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
personal information okay
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
i got him confused all right so um
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
i would say that this summer i've had a
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
little experience with uh cracked
 
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.990 align:start position:0%
little experience with uh cracked
screens

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
screens
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
and um first it was my my uh my wife
 
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.829 align:start position:0%
and um first it was my my uh my wife
linda's

00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
linda's
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
iphone um
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
in which of course we do have the
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
warranty that it that they with it with
 
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.350 align:start position:0%
warranty that it that they with it with
uh

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
um assertion uh you know which is a big
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
insurance company that uh does uh
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
cell phones um they have they have two
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
different ways to do it you pay them 27
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
if it's only just a crack screen there's
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with the phone
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh so which we signed up for and we sent
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
it out out to them
 
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
and well actually don't say you they
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
send you a box and you put it in there
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
and you send it out to them
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
and they and uh they sent it back and
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
said so sorry um it's you know you can't
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
you can't use that there there there's
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
something wrong with the phone
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
so not that we could see anything wrong
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
with the phone we turned the phone on we
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
got to operate everything sees
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
everything fine i don't see any
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
scratches i don't see deaths i don't see
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
anything wrong with it so that means we
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
got to spend the 200
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
to get it
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh so which we then duly call them up
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
they sent us the little box they did
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
credit us for the 27 that we passed
 
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.590 align:start position:0%
credit us for the 27 that we passed
before

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
uh and uh lo and behold the very next
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
day they did not wait to get that unit
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
the very next day we had a brand new
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
iphone delivered to us
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
so as far as i'm concerned if you're
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
gonna if you're gonna say well we're
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
gonna narrow it to crack screens
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
insurance thing works and i'll and i
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
really know that because
 
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh the other day or not less than a
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
month ago uh my old ipad and so it's
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
past warranty and stuff like that i was
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
in the bathroom and i pushed the little
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
button on the bottom and sure enough the
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
thing decided to do a somersault
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
and did i even though i have a
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
protective case around it i did did a
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
face plant on the bathroom floor and
 
00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
sure enough the screen was hopelessly
 
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
cracked all over the place
 
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.389 align:start position:0%
cracked all over the place
so

00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
uh i then called up the you know i said
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
what am i going to do who am i that's
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
not a warranty i don't have any extended
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
warranty i don't have anything on this
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
um but i do have a a
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
a third-party verizon store that's right
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
a mile away from the house so i called
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
them up and they said oh yeah bring it
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
on in 200 bucks
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
and sure enough
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
i brought it in it took a little longer
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
because they don't have it in stock they
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
got to wait until it come comes in
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
but they finally came in they put it in
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
and it's all good and it's the exact
 
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
same price as the insurance one 200
 
00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.110 align:start position:0%
same price as the insurance one 200
bucks

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
bucks
 
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.150 align:start position:0%
bucks
so

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
is to say that uh
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
we're hoping that somehow we're going to
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
save money somehow or do something
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
different that the marketplace the free
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
market's already taken care of i don't
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
know what i heard in the testimony is
 
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
these guys want to get in there with a
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
soldering iron
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
and start mucking around with the
 
00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:23.189 align:start position:0%
and start mucking around with the
hardware

00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
hardware
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry i i think that a
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturer has a right to say we don't
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
want anybody
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
messing with our our motherboards or
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
hardware or anything like that and if
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
you do it you do it at your own risk
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
but you know with your your
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
you know the say is now they're on an
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
obligation to explain where everything
 
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
is and where it is and all their how
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
they do how they did that motherboard
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
and how they worked it um
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
i i just think it is incredibly
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for the legislature to be
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
involved in that i would say i also have
 
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
finished reading steve jobs book this
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
summer and as chiefs does make a very
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
convincing argument about why he thinks
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's important that if a company wants
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
to have a sealed box and and doesn't
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
want anybody mucking around with it um
 
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.039 align:start position:0%
that that's an important prior priority
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
prior was a priority probably that was
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
the word i'm looking for right uh
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
private you know that they should have
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
they should be able to have that and and
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
for us to legislate that
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
um i just don't i just don't know how
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to be enforced are you going
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
to have called the ag's office and say
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
they won't they won't let me they won't
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
let somebody get a manual and and the ag
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
is going to get them call some
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and tell them to beat them
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
up for a manual and and worst of it is
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
what happens if this is a new hampshire
 
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
company what happens is there's somebody
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
doing high-tech stuff here right here in
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire i'm sure dean caiman probably
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be too crazy about anybody
 
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
getting inside some of the things he's
 
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.390 align:start position:0%
getting inside some of the things he's
making

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
and i just think this this is totally
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
inappropriate legislation
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative indrik do you
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
well i think i have some sympathy with
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
what representative hunt is saying in
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
that i have elected
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh to participate in the apple ecosystem
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
in large part because i do believe
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully not inaccurately that it is in
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
some sense safer and more private than
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
some other systems which can be more
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
open and certainly that was one of the
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
concerns i had with regard to the
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
legislation that was before us the
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
specific legislation and the language
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
regarding um
 
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
security lockout codes and things of
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
that nature where where i do see
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
some potential problems uh both
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
philosophical and practical
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
but on a more concrete level i do think
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
we've all experienced cracked screens
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
and defective charging ports and things
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
that really seems like in many instances
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
can plausibly be
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
disaggregated and separated from
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
security issues i believe
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
and insofar as that is the case i think
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable for us to have these
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
discussions and to see what we can do to
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
try to ensure
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh that that products have a life
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
expectancy that uh the consumers expect
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
when they pay a thousand dollars for a
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
cell phone
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
and i think it is reasonable for us to
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
have this and certainly we've heard a
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
fair amount from the public for
 
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
ecological reasons for budgetary reasons
 
00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:20.870 align:start position:0%
ecological reasons for budgetary reasons
uh

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
for just a matter of principle that
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of demand for this and i
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
think it is valuable to have these
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
conversations and i would hope that the
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
legislator would be open to doing so
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative abel
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um i think once again i
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
may be taking the minority position here
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
which is not unusual but uh and and i
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
don't exactly know how how everyone on
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
the committee will vote um
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
but i see the principal issue for me
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
being who i should represent and who i
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
am giving the highest priority to and i
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
see that as
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
the voters in my district who
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
live in new hampshire and who run
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
business small businesses in new
 
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.990 align:start position:0%
business small businesses in new
hampshire

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
and the corporations that are outside of
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
have a sec i have no real responsibility
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
to them
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
and so therefore
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
i feel that we should commend this bill
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
with changes
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh so that small businesses
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh can compete if if i as a as an
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
individual decide i want to go to them
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
affect something as i do with my car i
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
don't have to go to the dealer i don't
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
have to take it back to detroit um or
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
send it to them um that we should we
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
should look
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
out first for
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire small businesses
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
that are competing against out-of-state
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
large corporations so i i support uh i
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
support us making a recommendation uh in
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
favor of passing
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative abel
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
representative williams
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
my attitude is if i buy something
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
um it's mine it no longer belongs to
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
apple or to
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
you know whoever manufactured it you
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
know i was willing to pay for it
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
um you know if they structured it as if
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
it was you know some sort of a rental
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh maybe that would be different but
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
that's not really how it works i'm
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
buying it i'm using it and if it breaks
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
i should be able to fix it
 
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.350 align:start position:0%
i should be able to fix it
um

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.310 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
i think i would agree with
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative indrik about the the
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
issue of of
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.909 align:start position:0%
you know
recycling

00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
the idea of
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
tossing out a uh
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
device that costs in a lot of cases more
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
than a thousand dollars if it's a cell
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
phone and then obviously there's other
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
types of electronics that are even more
 
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.470 align:start position:0%
types of electronics that are even more
expensive

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh just because it doesn't work
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
even if you have insurance as
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative hunt does
 
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.390 align:start position:0%
representative hunt does
um

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
to get a new one that that means you're
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
putting a lot more uh some unrecyclable
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
stuff into the waste stream and in most
 
00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.110 align:start position:0%
stuff into the waste stream and in most
cases

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
the electronics like that are difficult
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
if not impossible to really reuse any of
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
any of the
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
the devices much less the
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
contents the materials
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
and so i i think
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
making the devices last as long as they
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
can and certainly there's people who get
 
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
new cell phones uh either sell or give
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
away their old ones because somebody
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
else can use them and so keeping them in
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
good repair and using them for as long
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
as possible i think is good for the
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
environment good for the economy um and
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
so i think it makes sense for us to to
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
move forward with some type of repair
 
00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.350 align:start position:0%
move forward with some type of repair
mechanism

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
so we were talking about who
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
might do this besides new hampshire and
 
00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.510 align:start position:0%
might do this besides new hampshire and
massachusetts

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
who of course did the automobile right
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
to repair and now are fighting about the
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
next round of that
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
also had a bill uh this year
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
that uh was electronic right to repair
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i don't believe they
 
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.230 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i don't believe they
uh

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
have completed their work on that and of
 
00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.750 align:start position:0%
have completed their work on that and of
course

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
like all the rest of us it's on the
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
ballot in massachusetts
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
the the the automobile one is but i'm
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
talking about the electronics
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
all right so remember that uh today
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
we're voting to recommend for future
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
legislation or not there will be lots of
 
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
time to
 
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.390 align:start position:0%
time to
detail

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
detail
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
the pieces
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
and we have a few more bills to uh to
 
00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:47.150 align:start position:0%
discuss so
 
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:48.549 align:start position:0%
discuss so
[Music]

00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative williams i'm sorry to
 
00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.029 align:start position:0%
representative williams i'm sorry to
interrupt

00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
interrupt
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
well i was done
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative hunt
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to respond to uh uh
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
representative abel's comment
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
they're not this is not competition
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
between new hampshire small businesses
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
against the big nasty corporation in
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
californ cupertino california
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
that little small new hampshire company
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
has every
 
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.990 align:start position:0%
has every
ability

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
ability
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
to become a licensed service center
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
from apple
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
and have no problem getting whatever
 
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
they need or manuals or whatever detail
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
what the issue is if i remember the
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
hearing properly is
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
they didn't like what the company wanted
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
to do for service
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
they wanted to get in there with a
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
soldering iron
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
because apple would say is you can
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
replace the motherboard if it's if
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
something's not work you're going to
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
replace the board but we don't want you
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
in there
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
touching our technology our board what
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
we put into it this is not competition
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
okay the competition is is the example
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
of what if you're going to say
 
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:53.909 align:start position:0%
of what if you're going to say
uh

00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
in my example which is what happens if a
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire corporation that really
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
has spent a lot of time work to micro
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
size they wanted taking this technology
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
and made it so small and so compact they
 
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
don't want anybody inside that they
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
don't want anybody to know what they did
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
what their their you know magic secret
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
sauce of how they made it
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
and this legislation is saying that they
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
have to hand over information to any
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
anybody and it could be an illegal could
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
be a third party you know a fake company
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
we had we did have a story i remember
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
the hearing there was somebody who was
 
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
using this as a fraudulent you know way
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
to you know get people to bring in their
 
00:25:30.799 --> 00:25:32.710 align:start position:0%
to you know get people to bring in their
computers

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
computers
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
to anybody and they're saying it's no if
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to do anything like that
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it on our terms so we
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
know who the person is and what they are
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
and whether they're really competent in
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
doing anything to it so this is this is
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
not small business competition this is a
 
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
small new hampshire business saying is i
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
i don't want to play by their rules i
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
don't want i want to i want to service
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
their product
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay because everybody wants that
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
product but i don't want to play by the
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
rules i don't want to pay the licensing
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
i don't want to have the regulation i
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
don't have the tools i don't want to
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
have i mean i just want give me the
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%

thank you representative hunt and

represent van houghton
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%

i'm sorry about that
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
i'll be very quick i think that the
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
polarization of our discussion right now
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
shows us that this bill really needs to
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
be changed in scope in order to go
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
forward i do i appreciate the the intent
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
of the bill i appreciate the idea of
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
small business
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
moving forward but the fact that we're
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
so so into the
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty of the bill uh in very
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
polarized fashion i think indicates to
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
me that this is certainly not ready to
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
go at least in this fashion it needs to
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
be fine-tuned it needs to be better
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
structured in order to make uh the
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
intent go forward thank you

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh small
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire non-profit corporations
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
obviously uh during the discussion there
 
00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:16.950 align:start position:0%
obviously uh during the discussion there
were

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
serious challenges to
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
the way this uh
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:28.389 align:start position:0%
 
structured

00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
structured
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
but that the intent uh still seems to be
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
something worth pursuing
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
and hopefully uh during this discussion
 
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
sort out whether or not that means that
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
we should
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
move ahead with recommending this for
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
i would defer to uh
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
representative abe
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
i would defer to representative ebel if
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%

great representative ebal thank you

okay um well thank you very much and uh
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative macbeth um
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh i i am indeed here with my husband
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
steve root who is much more of an expert
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
on these matters than i am but i
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
appreciate the
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
committee considering going forward with
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
in um in some fashion because i do
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
believe that the non-profits and the
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
directors who serve on those non-profits
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
on a voluntary basis
 
00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.549 align:start position:0%
on a voluntary basis
deserve

00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
deserve
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
at least some limitations on their
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
liability without a lot of direct
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
intervention if they don't know what the
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
law is
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
at a particular time so with that with
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
the with the chairman's permission i'd
 
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
like to turn um this over to my husband
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
steve root
 
00:32:15.679 --> 00:32:16.470 align:start position:0%
steve root
so

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
he is there with you and he is in the
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
room with me yes
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
great um
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
we will uh yes go ahead
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
mr root
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh chairman butler it's good to see the
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
representatives in good health
 
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.509 align:start position:0%
representatives in good health
um

00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:34.389 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
our proposal the this bill would have
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
changed the
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh structure
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
of uh limitation of liability for
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
directors and officers of non-profits
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
from what is currently in place which
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
requires a
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
a provision to be added to the articles
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
of agreement of these organizations um
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
in my experience a great number of the
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
states uh seven or eight thousand
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
non-profits have not done this
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
and i believe it's mainly just an
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
oversight on their part
 
00:33:05.679 --> 00:33:06.950 align:start position:0%
oversight on their part
however

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
when we propose to change the uh the
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
default provision so that
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
directors and officers would have this
 
00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.710 align:start position:0%
directors and officers would have this
protection

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
the division of charitable trusts
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
mr donovan
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
pointed out that that
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
one effect of this could be to make it
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
more difficult for his
 
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
his charitable trust unit to uh
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
protect organizations where directors or
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
officers had uh failed to meet their
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
standards of care
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
um in in looking at this he has a
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern his his charitable
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
trust units which by the way is
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
the oldest of its kind in the country
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
and very experienced uh
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
performs a really important function
 
00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.230 align:start position:0%
performs a really important function
uh

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
it is a very small minority of our
 
00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
organizations that that fail to meet the
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
standards but when they do
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
the charitable trust unit is able to
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh hold directors and officers
 
00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:07.269 align:start position:0%
uh hold directors and officers
accountable

00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
and in many cases make a recovery for
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
the organization that that can be very
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
important in salvaging a very bad
 
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.230 align:start position:0%
important in salvaging a very bad
situation

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
those recoveries are frequently paid for
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
out of dno insurance proceeds and in
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
fact that uh in the examples that mr
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
donovan pointed out i think
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
all of them
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
the recoveries were from dno insurance
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
and so his point is that if you if any
 
00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.589 align:start position:0%
and so his point is that if you if any
organization

00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
merely eliminates liability of directors
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
and officers
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
one effect of that can be that it's
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
letting the dno insurance
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
that's being bought and paid for by the
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
organization somewhat off the hook so
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
i've looked at this
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
and have discovered that in a number of
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
states i can identify at least four
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
the way this issue has been resolved is
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
to provide that a limitation of
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
liability is automatic
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
but does not extend to any coverage that
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
would be provided by a dno insurance
 
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.470 align:start position:0%
would be provided by a dno insurance
policy

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
so in this way there there remains a
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
recovery now i would point out there are
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of nonprofits in the state that
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
are very small that that
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
can't really afford dno insurance it's
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
not inexpensive and and so you have to
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
be of a certain size to have it and so
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
in some cases uh uh
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
an exception that says dno insurance
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
liability would remain and
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh wouldn't change the outcome but
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
i i believe there's a middle road here
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
that answers uh mr donovan's concerns uh
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
but it also goes to the point that
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
that uh was really the point of the bill
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
which is to
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh provide protection for directors
 
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
and officers from
 
00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that testimony
 
00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:02.870 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that testimony
um

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
and uh representative macbeth uh your
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
hand is still raised would you like to
 
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
comment now
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman so i'm i
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
really um i'm so grateful that the
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the bill this
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
willingness to work through the
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
identified issues with the attorney
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
general um is very important i think
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
that the liability of our non-profit
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
board of directors is really critical of
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
importance here in
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
portsmouth just recently we had a
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
non-profit pop-up new hampshire pop-up
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
portsmouth that
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
really got into some issues
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
and they even had they did have an
 
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
attorney on their board but um
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
i think shielding these people from not
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
all liability but um you know these
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
pop-ups i mean these non-profits are
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
small and they can't afford an attorney
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of times so to have this
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
limitation automatically
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
within the um you know the the um
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
bylaws would be very important so and i
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
also want to remind my colleagues when
 
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
we recommend this for
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
further legislation it might not be that
 
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
because of kovid i mean we're we're i
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
want us to think long term i mean it
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
might not be that this is the most
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
critical thing right now for all of us
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
but this is an issue that does need
 
00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:22.470 align:start position:0%
but this is an issue that does need
further

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
legislation so i would ask you to
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
consider that when you're making your
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
vote because this is something that
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed whether it can be
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
addressed you know starting in january
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
or the next or the next session but it
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
is a really important issue
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know to our communities thank you
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%

yes um in full disclosure i serve on two
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
non-profit boards one for the women's
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
club of concord and um
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
one for the merrimack valley daycare
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
center neither of which are a flush
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
we're all volunteers
 
00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:29.910 align:start position:0%
we're all volunteers
we

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:30.950 align:start position:0%
we
certainly

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
try to make decisions carefully
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
because we have fiduciary
 
00:38:35.359 --> 00:38:37.750 align:start position:0%
because we have fiduciary
responsibilities

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
but i think that this legislation would
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
be really helpful for us and i will vote
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
to recommend for further legislation
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands i don't know
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%

society

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
society

and the 1894 association which is part
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
of the library uh and my wife is
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
president of the rings chamber of
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
commerce having said that i have
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely had a conversation with the
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
charitable trust division and they said
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is chasing a problem that
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist and the last thing you
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
need to do is create some legal
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
complication that will vulnerably put
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
some non-profit into the exposure of
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
of some lawsuits
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
and um and so you know at the end of the
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
day if there's malfeasance going on
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
there um i don't think we want to
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
protect anybody
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that that person
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
who who is stealing money or doing
 
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
whatever they're doing inappropriately
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
is prosecuted to the full extent of the
 
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.349 align:start position:0%
is prosecuted to the full extent of the
law

00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
and the last thing we need to do is
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
muddle the waters with this this uh this
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
legend you know this potential
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
legislation when clearly there's doesn't
 
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
there has not been any evidence there's
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
a problem with our
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
current situation our current law and we
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
want to call it case law it really is
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%

representative hunt
 
00:40:39.359 --> 00:40:40.470 align:start position:0%
representative hunt
i'm

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
quite concerned that
 
00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.309 align:start position:0%
quite concerned that
uh

00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
removing liability
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
not the same as re you know i mean
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
requiring uh
 
00:40:59.430 --> 00:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh insurance uh there are a lot of gray
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
areas i also don't recall there being a
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
lot of uh
 
00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.390 align:start position:0%

uh
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
demand for for this legislation
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
on the part of nonprofits and so i think
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
there's just a way too too much to go
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
for us to recommend it fine
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%

i don't see any hands but i'm wondering
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative williams if you would uh
 
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
talk a bit about this bill before we
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
have a vote
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
proposed that there needs to be an
 
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.349 align:start position:0%
proposed that there needs to be an
affirmative

00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
affirmative
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
connection between the debt collector
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
and the debtor
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
prior to collection efforts starting so
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
that would require
 
00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.829 align:start position:0%
that would require
someone

00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
going to their house and sticking
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
an envelope on the door
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh or uh you know some other sort of
 
00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.109 align:start position:0%
uh or uh you know some other sort of
affirmative

00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
affirmative
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
connection between them
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
so that uh i think that
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
the concept was that uh some people
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
actually aren't aware that
 
00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.030 align:start position:0%
actually aren't aware that
there

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
that there's a debt to be collected
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
they the sponsors wanted to have uh
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
to be sure that the person who was the
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
debtor uh was aware that collection
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
effort was starting
 
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.870 align:start position:0%
effort was starting
um

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
well you know i i certainly understand
 
00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.630 align:start position:0%
well you know i i certainly understand
the

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
the issue of you know having somebody
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
harass you call you all hours of the day
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
or night
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know robo calls and recordings
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
and things like that can be very
 
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:19.349 align:start position:0%
and things like that can be very
annoying

00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
annoying
 
00:47:19.359 --> 00:47:20.390 align:start position:0%
annoying
uh

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
it isn't clear to me that this
 
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
type of process
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
actually makes the debt collection
 
00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:28.549 align:start position:0%
actually makes the debt collection
uh

00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
any easier on the debtor
 
00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.150 align:start position:0%
any easier on the debtor
um

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
i i would
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
be quite happy to see us come up with
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of uh telephone calls
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
that people got
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
because i think
 
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
robo calls and those kinds of things are
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
annoying i mean i don't get
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
deader calls but i get lots of them
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
trying to sell me extended car
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
warranties for some reason
 
00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.990 align:start position:0%
warranties for some reason
um

00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
but um i think
 
00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.589 align:start position:0%
but um i think
um

00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
it wasn't clear to me that this bill was
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
actually going to work and this of
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
course was before uh the the pandemic
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
nobody wants somebody coming up on their
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
front porch and knocking on their door
 
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
or or even sticking an envelope on their
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
door uh at this point of course
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll be past that point at
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
some point

exactly
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
so let's move on to a discussion of
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
house bill 1508 relative to paper
 
00:50:29.839 --> 00:50:46.870 align:start position:0%
house bill 1508 relative to paper
receipts

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
and representative weston
 
00:50:50.319 --> 00:50:51.750 align:start position:0%
and representative weston
um

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
yes i think that we're all we're moving
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
in this direction we're all having this
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
experience where we order we uh make a
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
purchase with a credit card and
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
they say do you want me to email it or
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
do you want a paper receipt
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
so that's happening more and more
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
uh with this bill though we ran into a
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
problem because it requires
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh businesses with more than 20
 
00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:16.950 align:start position:0%
uh businesses with more than 20
employees

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
to not give a receipt unless it's asked
 
00:51:19.359 --> 00:51:20.390 align:start position:0%
to not give a receipt unless it's asked
for

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
and the real issues came up when we were
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
talking about cast cash-based
 
00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.470 align:start position:0%
talking about cast cash-based
transactions

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
transactions
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
um and one of the people who testified
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the
 
00:51:31.839 --> 00:51:33.589 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the
um

00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:33.599 --> 00:51:34.470 align:start position:0%
um
that

00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
return fraud is really a growing
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
business and something like 21 of the
 
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.670 align:start position:0%
business and something like 21 of the
returns

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
returns
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
uh that don't have a receipt are
 
00:51:44.079 --> 00:51:45.430 align:start position:0%
uh that don't have a receipt are
fraudulent

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
fraudulent
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
you know this this may be something
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
that's going to evolve in time but i
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
think at this point um it's a little
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
premature there are a lot of people who
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
are still
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
not comfortable with the idea of not
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
having a receipt and there's too much
 
00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.430 align:start position:0%
having a receipt and there's too much
fraud

00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hunt
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you uh so you know maybe it's
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
kind of code or whatever but i i don't
 
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
think i have had any transactions at all
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
in which they did not ask me
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
if i wanted to waive the receipt
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
so um i think that this legislation is
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
really not necessary anymore that
 
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
businesses are more than willing not to
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
print the receipt for you
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%

00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
this is ordinarily the type of bill that
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
i would say has too many unanswered
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
questions and too much uh that needs to
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
be ironed out before it goes forward
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
however i am aware and i don't know if
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
he's on if if jerry carrick is on if
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
representative connecticut
 
00:54:38.559 --> 00:54:40.230 align:start position:0%
representative connecticut
um

00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
after simply saying that the revisions
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
that i've seen him make um predispose me
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
to believe that he can make this happen
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
and so i would be willing to add to
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
recommend that we move this forward on
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
the basis of the integrity that i have
 
00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:53.829 align:start position:0%
the basis of the integrity that i have
seen

00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
to already make a better bill even
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
though it has stalled and so i will
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
defer to representative clerk if he's
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
available to address the issue
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
he has his hand in the air
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
other committee members who want to
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
speak before we go to members of the
 
00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:11.990 align:start position:0%

audience

worked hand-in-hand with legislators

they're currently going through rigorous

00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
international
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
registration we believe that this bill
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
is is a good bill but it can be improved
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
without the restriction on um
 
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
out-of-state manufacturers of cbd being
 
00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.950 align:start position:0%
out-of-state manufacturers of cbd being
included

00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
that is overly burdensome
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
and as it was referenced before we don't
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
want to create this environment where
 
00:56:50.789 --> 00:56:50.799 align:start position:0%
it's looked at competitively between
 
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
in-state manufacturers and out-of-state
 
00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.710 align:start position:0%
in-state manufacturers and out-of-state
manufacturers

00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
the industry standard is for
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
an out-of-state manufacturer to meet the
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
standards of the actual state in
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
addition to that um there's another uh
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
level where some states are requiring
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
that a usda um hemp plan has been
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
approved by the usda
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
so we're recommending that we strike
 
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:18.789 align:start position:0%
so we're recommending that we strike
through

00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
that requirement that the
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
the product has to be manufactured in
 
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
state because it's an undue burden and
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
it actually
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
will uh restrict the consumers of the
 
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
ability to have a free and open market
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
as well as producers um
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
the hemp industry we've been growing
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
we've been progressing we are uh aligned
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
with making sure we're in compliance
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
with regulations and we think it would
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
be a disservice to the consumers of the
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire if you restrict
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to participate and the
 
00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
involvement of all the knowledge and
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
experience from out-of-state producers
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%

00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%

00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
should come forward absolutely i work in
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
a number of states with hand-in-hand
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%

working with legislators that want to do
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
the right thing but they want to make
 
00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
sure that they take in all the concerns
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%

we put out good legislation and that it
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't restrict the participation out
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
of state manufacturers with experience
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your uh ability
 
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
to be here and to give us commentary
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
and uh we will move on to representative
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:15.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
here he is
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
okay can you hear me okay
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
we can okay
 
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much for allowing me
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
to speak for a moment um first before
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
you do anything else i have to say i
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
agree 100 with a previous speaker that
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
was a drafting error
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
um what it was that is only supposed to
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
be any food product containing cbd and
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
that is because it is fda uh is against
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
fda rules to transport food with cbd in
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
it across state lines so the idea is the
 
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
cbd can produce anywhere but if it's
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
going to be added to food it had to be
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
added here within this um
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
within this state so that's what that
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
has to do with so i do agree with her
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
100 i didn't realize i could go onto
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
video there we go
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
so uh let me go back just continuing to
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
understand that cbd
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
is really quite a fad drug it does have
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
some serious effects uh particularly we
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
are still uncertain about the effects
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
during pregnancy this bill is really
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
meant primarily to be a public health
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
bill to deal with labeling and testing
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
requirements to be sure that there's a
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
quality product that does not come in
 
01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:26.799 align:start position:0%
with pesticides or comes in with no cbd
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
at all or that we have pregnant or
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
lactating women taking it until we know
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
a little bit more about it
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
so the information you got from the
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
national products association that was
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
sent to you just a couple of days ago
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
discusses the fact that the fda still
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
has not given any regulatory guidance
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
that is a problem and that is why i put
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
in this bill on the state level now
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
again there were a number of drafting
 
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
errors i did send to everybody a
 
01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.390 align:start position:0%
errors i did send to everybody a
suggested

01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
amendment i did not draft an amendment
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
because the bill is no longer in my
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
hands but it's in the committee hands
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
one was to get to strike the word uh
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
sorry to add the word food product so
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
that it is not going to regulate uh
 
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
any cbd product sorry it will regulate
 
01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
but it will not prohibit out of state
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
products uh there were some other things
 
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
that were confusing because uh it was
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
stated that the lab testing had that the
 
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.630 align:start position:0%
stated that the lab testing had that the
uh

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
we had to authorize or certify the lab
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
that doesn't need to be done there are
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
certifications for labs we just have to
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
approve it that was a sticking point
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
because the amf put in a bunch of money
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
for being able to figure out how to
 
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
certify a lab they do not need to
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
they're certified federally already
 
01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
there were some other typos and i also
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
softened the wording on breastfeeding to
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
be consistent with the cdc
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations and not the text that i
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
had in there were a few other minor
 
01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:49.839 align:start position:0%
issues that just had to do with labeling
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
and there was also another drafting
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
error uh regarding the registration it
 
01:01:55.069 --> 01:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
was listed as
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
75.75 dollars per product
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
again a number of these things impacted
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note because
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
damf thought there's all kinds of things
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
they had to do now you may recall that
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
one of the major sticking points is the
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
dm damf really did not want to have
 
01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
anything to do with this bill
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
period that's probably not unreasonable
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
given the fact that it really is a
 
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
public health bill it has to do with cbd
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
in food and has to do which comes under
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
dhhs food safety it also is an issue
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
that it is a drug um cbd and its pure
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
form epidiolex is actually approved as a
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
drug it is not regulated though by the
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
fda in terms of the cbd that we see
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
being sold at a local gas station so it
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
is a public health problem it makes much
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
more sense for it to reside entirely
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
within dhhs i had split it it went to a
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
draft or for damf which is partly why
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
some of the things came through with
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
some drafting errors that didn't make
 
01:02:54.319 --> 01:02:55.670 align:start position:0%
some drafting errors that didn't make
sense

01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
so what i would like to do would be
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
reintroduce the bill with all the
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
changes that i put in
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
in the proposed amendment that i sent to
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
you all i think yesterday
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
secondly uh get it all into dhhs hands
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
completely remove damf so they have
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with it which makes more
 
01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:13.910 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with it which makes more
sense

01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
thirdly is if necessary increase the
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
fee per product if necessary in order to
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
try to make it as close to self-funding
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
as possible because even though it is
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
intended to be self-funded there are of
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
course some minor startup costs with
 
01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
beginning any kind of a program and
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
given the budget that could be
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
conceivably a problem i feel it should
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
go forward and it really should go
 
01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
forward simply on the basis of the fact
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
that we do need to continue to protect
 
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
the public health i should disclose that
 
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
i currently am the chair of the
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
board so we take a very strong interest
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
in trying to understand what the issues
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
and risks are for therapeutic cannabis
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
and that would include both thc
 
01:03:59.910 --> 01:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
and cbd and we are currently working on
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
our guidance and educational things for
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
both providers and patients regarding
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
the what cbd risks are and what do we
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
know about it during either pregnancy or
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
lactation right now you can sell
 
01:04:13.039 --> 01:04:14.069 align:start position:0%
lactation right now you can sell
something

01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
first of all you don't even know how
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
much cbd is in it it isn't required
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
secondly there's no warning about uh its
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
impact in pregnancy no warning about
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
its impact upon other drugs you may take
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
if you're on a statin many of us are for
 
01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
high elevated cholesterol it interferes
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
with the metabolism of that because the
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
same cytochrome breaks down both so all
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
these things are real problems these
 
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
things need to be
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
stated you need to know that you're
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
getting a pure product know what the
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
risks are and also no unfounded health
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
claims that's again what this is about
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
it's a public health bill i would like
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
to proceed with it next year with all
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
these multiple changes
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%

hey sorry about that it's kyle circ with
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
the natural products association uh i
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
just wanted to echo some of the points
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
that representative knurk and the
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
previous speaker had made
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
this a really great bill from our
 
01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.750 align:start position:0%
this a really great bill from our
standpoint

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
just a little bit about mpa we're the
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
largest trade association representing
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
the dietary supplement and nutritional
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
care space
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
we have about 750 members with
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
several independent health food stores
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire as well
 
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
as a dietary supplement
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
we've seen cbd
 
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
across the country have issues
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
particularly with labeling as well as
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
when you are testing products heavy
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
metals pesticides are a common
 
01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:17.839 align:start position:0%
theme when you do
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
analysis of of these products so having
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh labeling requirements uh like what
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes is a great uh is a
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
great step and a great requirement to
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
have so thank you thank you all
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and uh
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
representative hunt you have your uh
 
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
your hand up yeah great thank you mr
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
chairman uh so i'm confused because i
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
thought cbd doesn't do we don't know
 
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything that's why fda
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
hasn't approved it so
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
you know i know these guys have gone
 
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
offline but
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
my concern i guess i asked jerry is
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
so if the intent of the bill is that
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
there's going to be this whole laundry
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
list of things that has not been proven
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
what what is the labelings gonna what's
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
the labeling going to look like and
 
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
what's the labeling requirements but
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
more importantly i'm what i'm worried
 
01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.069 align:start position:0%
more importantly i'm what i'm worried
about

01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
is giving the wrong impression that if
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
says this is okay or something the state
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
says this is some kind of seal of
 
01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
approval that's going to tell people
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
that this stuff is good for something
 
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
and i think that's absolutely the wrong
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
message we want to be sending to anybody
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
because as far as i know it's it's quack
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
medicine you know um so the idea of that
 
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to have this long legit i
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
guess a is i guess you can get jerry
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
back but is there going to be a long
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
laundry list of things it does not
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
do or
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
how what is this labeling requirements
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
going to do
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
and b is isn't he at all concerned that
 
01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
now this is going to give the wrong
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
impression to people that this stuff is
 
01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:47.589 align:start position:0%
impression to people that this stuff is
is

01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:52.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
representative hunt
 
01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
and i am seeing more people in the
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
audience who want to speak
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
no i guess
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
those those hands in the audience need
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
to be uh lowered
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
well though they were raised
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
you know again so
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
these are the people that spoke and then
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
they would answer my question
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
so the representative from the national
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
product association would you uh
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh comment
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
you're back in um you're allowed to
 
01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:29.269 align:start position:0%
you're back in um you're allowed to
speak

01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
yeah sure
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
so so in terms of health claims right
 
01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:34.149 align:start position:0%
so so in terms of health claims right
now

01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:08:34.159 --> 01:08:36.070 align:start position:0%
now
um

01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:37.759 align:start position:0%
representative hunt is on the right
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
track there when it when he's uh talking
 
01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:42.799 align:start position:0%
about you know what are um
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
claims that cbd products are able to
 
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:46.799 align:start position:0%
make right now if you look at all the
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
warning letters um the fda has issued
 
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.189 align:start position:0%
warning letters um the fda has issued
four

01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh cbd products they do
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
they do go around um
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
kind of what claims are being made so
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
for example products that are saying
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
that they could uh cure cancer and some
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the more egregious
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
um claims that are being made i i think
 
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
what we've seen
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:14.799 --> 01:09:15.990 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
would work here is you know um
 
01:09:21.759 --> 01:09:22.870 align:start position:0%
would work here is you know um
not

01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
not um
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
oh jeez i just lost my train of thought
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
here for a second
 
01:09:27.759 --> 01:09:32.950 align:start position:0%
here for a second
um

01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry about that um so yeah when it
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
comes to labeling here i i think
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
as long as these products are um being
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
labeled with the appropriate amounts of
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
cbd i think you're on the right track
 
01:09:46.239 --> 01:09:48.229 align:start position:0%
cbd i think you're on the right track
there

01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you right but they're saying this
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
i can't it's bad for pregnancy and bad
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
for statins is that going to say that on
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
the labels is that what
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd like to hear representative
 
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
kerner is that what he's looking for
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
well and representative kanerk has
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
raised his hand so we will uh hear from
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
him again
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
okay there we are yeah yeah i i can now
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
you can you hear me
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
yes we can okay good um actually what
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
the what the warning about pregnancy
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
would be as i say is currently going to
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
be consonant with what is recommended by
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
cdc and that is simply
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
there may be serious risks to using
 
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
products containing cbd if you are
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
pregnant or breastfeeding so it is not a
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
long laundry list regarding the health
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
claims it just says you cannot make
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
unfounded health claims so
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't have a laundry list of
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
things the uh issues too
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
to suggest
 
01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
or i should say the positive comments
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
that you should consult the medical
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
provider if you're taking this with
 
01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
other medications and that's because the
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
interaction we don't want to go through
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
a laundry list that would be
 
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
inappropriate but you should talk to
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
your provider if you're on
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
a statin which again a subnet stand
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
strong number of people are they may
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
need to adjust their dose a warning to
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
keep it out of the reach of children and
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
the most important thing is to label
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
what the content of cbd is
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
and to make sure it actually contains
 
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
what it is some of it's sold without
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
even having cdc this does not make any
 
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
claims that this is
 
01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:26.470 align:start position:0%
claims that this is
a

01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
healthful supplement uh there's nothing
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
that's implicit in that at all the point
 
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
is that market is there this is a
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
booming market what we're trying to do
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
is protect customers from the snake oil
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
salesman that say this is good for
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
everything and even
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
may make a claim on it saying that it
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
cures cancer that should simply not be
 
01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.550 align:start position:0%
cures cancer that should simply not be
there

01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is it's important to
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
understand that it can have up to .3 thc
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
and if you are in a job that requires a
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
drug test you should be warned of the
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
fact that this does contain thc because
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
you may fail a drug test and get fired
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
when you've just taken you thought only
 
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.189 align:start position:0%
when you've just taken you thought only
cbd

01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
cbd
 
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
so those are the kind of warnings the
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
things that have to do with making it
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
safe uh
 
01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
not a laundry list of things we don't
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
know but the things we do know and again
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
staying consistent with what we have for
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
warnings from the cdc and uh
 
01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.550 align:start position:0%
warnings from the cdc and uh
to

01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
to for the pregnancy and breastfeeding
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
because although we do know what all the
 
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
details we do have some concerns because
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
certainly uh whole plant cannabis does
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
have some very clear deleterious effects
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
we still have to start to tease out a
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more and epidiolex which is
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
the pure form of cbd has highly
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
substantial risks that are associated
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
with it that is generally at a higher
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
dose and but it is not a risk-free drug
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
by any means
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm here for any other
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
questions you have
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative connerk and
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
ms strong murray powell
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
sorry i had to unmute i i also want to
 
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank representative hunt for raising
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
the point about labeling labeling is
 
01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
extremely important i think there's uh
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
three key things to think about um one
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
would be making sure that you link
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
either by a qr code or by a website
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
address to the coas which are the
 
01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
certificates of analysis which will show
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
that that product has gone to a
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
third-party test uh testing lab and
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
they've gone through the rigorous
 
01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
testing and you can see uh what you will
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
see is a laundry list of cannabinoids
 
01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
that are included the fact that that
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
product does not have lead and solvents
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
and other contaminants and that it's
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
safe for for consumers um also you'll
 
01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
probably see um something indicating
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
that this product contains a total delta
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
nine thc concentration that does not
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
exceed the the federal standard of 0.3
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
um and and that's really really critical
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
and then just for accountability sake um
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
some type of address for the
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturing site so that you can
 
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
definitely trace it by latching and a
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
lot and batch number to the person who
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
is making this available to consumers so
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
labeling is important you don't have to
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
have a extremely long label you can link
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
to the necessary information by qr code
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
or listing a web address
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
it's amazing to me that there is that
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
degree of sophistication in the labeling
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
and yet the federal government
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
is not able to
 
01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:44.470 align:start position:0%
is not able to
um

01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
participate in this process it's
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
on a state-by-state basis still
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for that uh commentary um and
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh ms darlington uh
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.590 align:start position:0%
 
she

01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
she
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
is on the way
 
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
ms darlington if you could unmute
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
yourself and uh give us your thoughts on
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to unmute her and i can't
 
01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
if you can hear us ms darlington you
 
01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
need to unmute yourself
 
01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
wonderful can you hear me can you hear
 
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
me now yes
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
hi great well good afternoon everyone
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for this meeting we
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
were very excited to hear all the
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
conversation about this bill in
 
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
particular my name is amanda darlington
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
i'm with the council for responsible
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
nutrition we're the leading trade
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
association on dietary supplements
 
01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturer suppliers were based out of
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
dc and i just wanted to echo
 
01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.110 align:start position:0%
dc and i just wanted to echo
miss

01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
miss
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
murray's statements as well relabeling
 
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
and just wanted to throw in the mix here
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
that dietary supplements in particular
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
are comprehensively regulated at the
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
federal level by the federal by fda and
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
by ftc and labeling requirements are
 
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and
 
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
i remember earlier in the hearing as
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
well just to kind of throw our hat in
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
crn is advocating very stringently at
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
the federal level
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
for fda to appropriately regulate
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
cbd hemp derived cbd products coming out
 
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
of the 2018 farm bills legalization of
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
hemp and taking it off the controlled
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
substances list so we would also
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee and also the
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill if this bill is
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
reintroduced next year in deference to
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
the push in congress right now the last
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
ditch efforts and also
 
01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
the overall strategy of getting fda to
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
regulate these dietary supplement
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
products in particular because there is
 
01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive regulatory framework
 
01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
already in place we would
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
love to speak further with the sponsor
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
about how that will look and
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
representative hunt to answer your
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
question re-labeling requirements it's
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
another reason why we are all pushing
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
fda to appropriately regulate these
 
01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
products because the framework is very
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
much already in place and if these
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
products were susceptible to these
 
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory requirements they would be
 
01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.830 align:start position:0%
regulatory requirements they would be
regulated

01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you for paying attention to
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
this issue uh in new hampshire
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
and uh representative van houghton
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
thank you yes i did thank you very much
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
um i appreciate everything that we've
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
heard some of it is of a complexity that
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
is a little beyond my pay grade
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
however i would just like to simplify
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
to a basic question any one of those who
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
have spoken from the audience if i could
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
get an answer from one of you please i
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
would appreciate that
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
are we talking about cbd products
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
currently marketed as dietary
 
01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.550 align:start position:0%
currently marketed as dietary
supplements

01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
supplements
 
01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:03.669 align:start position:0%
supplements
that

01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
are devoted devoid of this type of
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
information on the label yet i can still
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
purchase them today if i wish to do so
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
and representative knurk has that uh
 
01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:19.430 align:start position:0%
and representative knurk has that uh
answer

01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
unmute yourself there we go okay yeah
 
01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:28.960 align:start position:0%

um and i have uh gone into one of our
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
local stores picked it up actually when
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
you stop at um
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
when i get off exit uh
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
off route 93 it actually for getting
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
onto 104 to come home from concord and
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
you go in the grocery store the uh
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
little store there associated with the
 
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
gas station huge sign right in the door
 
01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
we sell cbd products i've gone into
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
health food stores picked them up
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh indeed uh some of them do have some
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
labeling vermont does have a robust
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
program so one of the stores in our area
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
which carries vermont products yes
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
indeed there is a link with either with
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
a qr code or or website to be able to
 
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
get to this certificate of analysis and
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
i agree with the comments uh again made
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh by ms strong and that is that we do
 
01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
need to have
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
tracking that's available eat with ease
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
you can't put all this on it i mean the
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
certificate of analysis which has any
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
potential toxins and lead and so on and
 
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
so forth and the cannabinoid profile
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's too much to stick on the small
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
bottle that's where you would link to it
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
with a qr code or some other technique
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
and also in the proposed amendment i did
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
have information about the name and
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
address of the manufacturer as was
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
brought up because that is important to
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
be able to track down
 
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
and also the date of
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
manufacture so that you do know and you
 
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
can track it if there is a problem all
 
01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
those are normal public health type of
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
issues that need to be on this again
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
those were left out of the original bill
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
but they're on my list of amendments um
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
but yes you can buy these right now
 
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
and those labeling uh
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
again the ones that come out of vermont
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
do have some labels but you do not have
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
this protection of having the
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
information available in general because
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
required so yes you can get this
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kanerk and mr
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
chairman mr chairman i would like to ask
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
jerry a question directly do you mind if
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
i um i uh come on live is good
 
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
since since he is here uh representative
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
van houghton also has a question
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative van houghton
 
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
um do you mind if representative hunt
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
gets his question asked or do you want
 
01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.390 align:start position:0%
gets his question asked or do you want
to

01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
she wants to ask him a question
 
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
well actually mine is just a quick
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up to representative knurk
 
01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:48.870 align:start position:0%
follow-up to representative knurk
please

01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
very quick uh just representative kenner
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
in the absence
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
of fda regulations
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
would you say that it is appropriate
 
01:20:59.110 --> 01:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
that legislation to somehow get labeling
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
is appropriate regardless of how you
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
work this out in legislation in the next
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
session uh is that is that the intent
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
and is that the purpose of what you're
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
saying today
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
yes that's always been the primary pro
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
point of this whole bill is
 
01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:16.950 align:start position:0%
point of this whole bill is
safety

01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh through appropriate labeling of
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
the appropriate warnings and the
 
01:21:21.679 --> 01:21:22.870 align:start position:0%
the appropriate warnings and the
contents

01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
contents
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh so that we are have a product which
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
we are not
 
01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:28.639 align:start position:0%
we're not pretending that we authorize
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
as something that is effective but at
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
least if you go in to buy it you
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
actually are getting what you say you
 
01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
know what you're getting you have
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate warnings and you cannot have
 
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
claims that are made that are false in
 
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
the marketing of it so yes the labeling
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
requirements really need to be there
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
so so jerry you're a doctor
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
would you ever recommend
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
cbc for anything
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
would you ever recommend this for
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
anybody yes number
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
number one it actually is fda approved
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh for the treatment of certain types of
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
seizures that is a drug called epidialyx
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
which is the whole fallacy of calling
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
this a schedule two
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
material because it's clearly not
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
schedule two schedule two means there is
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
no medical value to it it's been
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
approved by the fda so you have the dea
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
and the fda
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
totally taking different sides of what
 
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
this is all about and which shows the
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
insanity of our of our system of not
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
regulating it appropriately in any case
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
so cbd
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
in a prescription form epidiolex is a
 
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
normal drug that is used there is some
 
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
pretty good evidence though for cbd in a
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
number of things and we actually
 
01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:40.390 align:start position:0%
number of things and we actually
um

01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
processed in the therapeutic canvas
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board questions about
 
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
problems anxiety and insomnia and so on
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
and they do not require prescription
 
01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
epidialx which is ghastly expensive
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
would not be covered for uh other
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
indications other than pediatric
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
seizures but there is evidence that this
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
can be effective for some of these other
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that answer
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
let's not uh spend the afternoon on this
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative hunt
 
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
one more quick question please yes or no
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
keep it simple okay
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
i in my mind
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
you just said okay but there is a
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
prescription formula
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
do we want to confuse consumers
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
who are buying it at a gas station
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
that they are buying the same thing
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
that they could go to a doctor and get a
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
prescription for
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
and that by putting a state label on it
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
and says
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
well this
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
product complies
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
and there you know we you know we
 
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
haven't tested it but they tell us this
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
is what's in it right because we're not
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
going to actually do the testing okay
 
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to tell you this don't you
 
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
think that that gives the consumer the
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
the wrong impression
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
that this actually is effective
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
for whatever they think it is and that
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
this is a good thing to buy
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
when they should be not be doing that
 
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
they should be going to their physic
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
their primary care physician and getting
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
the prescription one
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
may i answer please
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
yes first of all
 
01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:17.750 align:start position:0%
yes first of all
uh

01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
unless they're independently wealthy
 
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be able to afford
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
the prescription form of epidialex for
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
something else because it will not be
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
covered by their insurance company for
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
off-label use that's extremely unlikely
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
secondly is we are not giving any
 
01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
authorization it is epidiolex is a
 
01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
totally different
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
issue because it is a prescription drug
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
i do not think this gives any sense that
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's effective for everything because
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
that claim is not made in fact that's
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
precisely the part of this bill you
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
can't make a claim that it's effective
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
for anything if you wanted to put down
 
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
effective procedures if you drink the
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
whole bottle five times a day that might
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
be allowable because you might be
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
getting to the dose epidialx is actually
 
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
a very high-dose drug a lot more cbd
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
than most people would probably take in
 
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
a day so we are not giving a stamp of
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
approval that this is good for
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
everything that ails you indeed we're
 
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
restricting it so people cannot make
 
01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
that kind of a claim
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
i think that answers your question i'm
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
not 100 sure if i did and i should also
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
say that you ask would i recommend it
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's also important to realize the
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
over-the-counter cbd is not a
 
01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
prescription drug it is also not illegal
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
currently so it can be recommended very
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
different than therapy to cannabis which
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
we don't prescribe we just allow a
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
person to be certified for
 
01:25:33.199 --> 01:25:34.070 align:start position:0%
person to be certified for
so

01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
i am wanting to tie up this conversation
 
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:42.560 align:start position:0%

uh complex bill
 
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
is recommended for future legislation
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:52.159 --> 01:27:54.390 align:start position:0%

we will move on to
 
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 1588 establishing a mortgage
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
mediation procedure
 
01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:05.030 align:start position:0%
mediation procedure
and

01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
could i have
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
some discussion of this bill and seeing
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
no hands representative williams would
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
sure thank you mr chairman
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:20.550 align:start position:0%
um so
uh

01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
when when i
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
put this bill together uh i obviously
 
01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
didn't anticipate
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh a pandemic that would have a serious
 
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
effect on
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's economy
 
01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
but i think that we're going to see
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
a lot more
 
01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:41.270 align:start position:0%
a lot more
foreclosures

01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
foreclosures
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
going forward as
 
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully the
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
the country and the state uh start
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
recovering from this it's gonna take a
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
long time
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
there will be people who will
 
01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:55.110 align:start position:0%
there will be people who will
have

01:28:55.110 --> 01:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
financial difficulties we'll be out of
 
01:28:58.709 --> 01:28:58.719 align:start position:0%
work we'll
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
lose their businesses
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
and so i think the foreclosure rate is
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
going to rise significantly
 
01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:08.390 align:start position:0%
going to rise significantly
um

01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
that being said i think that um
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know we had a lot of arguments from
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
the banks on this bill and on the pre my
 
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
previous bill on judicial foreclosure
 
01:29:20.709 --> 01:29:20.719 align:start position:0%
that we don't have foreclosures in new
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire that they're few and far
 
01:29:23.669 --> 01:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
between and when they are
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
you know it's purely a case of somebody
 
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
just not paying their bills
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:31.189 align:start position:0%
i think
that

01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's not the case and certainly won't
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
be the case going forward and so
 
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
i believe that it's important for us to
 
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
have some kind of
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
additional protection
 
01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:42.790 align:start position:0%
additional protection
for

01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
people who
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
fall into this
 
01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:47.750 align:start position:0%
fall into this
crevasse

01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
crevasse
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:29:50.159 --> 01:29:51.430 align:start position:0%
i think that
something

01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be done certainly there have
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
been some efforts some emergency efforts
 
01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:55.990 align:start position:0%
been some efforts some emergency efforts
around

01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:29:58.709 --> 01:29:58.719 align:start position:0%
for stalling foreclosures or you know
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
potentially providing some financial
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
assistance uh through the cares act and
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
other measures and governor's emergency
 
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.110 align:start position:0%
other measures and governor's emergency
orders

01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
orders
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
but i think uh
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
long term we're still going to have
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
issues it's going to be a few years i
 
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
think before
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
the economy fully recovers
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
having something in place that will
 
01:30:20.719 --> 01:30:21.750 align:start position:0%
having something in place that will
protect

01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
protect
 
01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
people who
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh end up in foreclosure
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh through
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
no fault of their own
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
is important
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for bringing us uh
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%

i agree strongly that this um this is an
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
important issue that needs to go forward
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
um we don't know in what form as
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative williams said this is all
 
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
evolving now
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
the committee is aware that there have
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
been some issues brought before us in
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
the past
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
but i think it's going to become more
 
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
focused as we get move forward so i i
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
definitely think um this is a bill uh an
 
01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
issue that the committee should keep its
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
eye on and i definitely encourage
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
everyone to
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
you know recommend it for further study
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
and further legislation and further
 
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you
 
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and i was a member of
 
01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:27.910 align:start position:0%
thank you and i was a member of
the

01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
mortgage uh
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
foreclosure study
 
01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:33.430 align:start position:0%
foreclosure study
committee

01:31:33.430 --> 01:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
several years ago
 
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
and that was a robust and
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
valuable discussion
 
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
and there are a number of
 
01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:47.669 align:start position:0%
and there are a number of
successful

01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
successful
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
efforts at helping people who are
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
approaching and going through
 
01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:53.669 align:start position:0%
approaching and going through
foreclosure

01:31:53.669 --> 01:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
foreclosure
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
from some mortgage companies but not
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily for all
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
and some uh mortgages are sold and
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
resold and it the
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
likelihood that the person who is going
 
01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
through foreclosure in those situations
 
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
who knows uh who they're dealing with uh
 
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
can be
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh nine impossible to find to follow the
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
thread to uh know who to talk to and and
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
how to get advocacy uh for your
 
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
particular situation i think it is well
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
worth continuing to
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
explore for those people who
 
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh are likely as representative
 
01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
williams said uh to end up in a
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
situation uh in part because of the
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the economic impact of it
 
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
so i would support
 
01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
and uh i see a hand
 
01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:50.870 align:start position:0%
and uh i see a hand
from

01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
mr hale
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
can we uh hear from him
 
01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:57.990 align:start position:0%
can we uh hear from him
absolutely

01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
if you can unmute yourself
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
can can you hear me we can excellent
 
01:33:11.110 --> 01:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
well it's uh it's nice to see everyone
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh i wish i we saw you in person but uh
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
it's nice to see you all here um yeah i
 
01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
just wanted to um bring up the point um
 
01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
and i know it was brought up during
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
testimony that um our banks are uh you
 
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
know to the bill the substance of the
 
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
bill is establishing mediation um to
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh modify the loan um i think it during
 
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
our testimony we had a banker testified
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
to the fact that banks are providing um
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
modifications and uh foreclosure really
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
is the last
 
01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:46.550 align:start position:0%
is the last
um

01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
last means or
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh last opportunity that they that they
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
look to seek um and i think to
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative williams point and um you
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
know during the coven 19 pandemic uh our
 
01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
our banks and we surveyed our banks uh
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
it's safe to say that they all are
 
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
working with their their homeowners
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
their borrowers the the folks that they
 
01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
hold mortgages on to keep them in their
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
houses through these forbearance
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
programs and continuing to tailor these
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
programs in a manner that makes it um
 
01:34:23.110 --> 01:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable to pay back uh and what best
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
fits each one of those uh home buyers um
 
01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:28.149 align:start position:0%
fits each one of those uh home buyers um
so

01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:28.159 --> 01:34:29.030 align:start position:0%
so
again

01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
as we mentioned in our testimony we
 
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
oppose this proposal we'll be opposing
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
any future proposals because we feel the
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
industry is already doing what they can
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
to help the homeowner
 
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
stay in their homes and ultimately at
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
the end of the day um
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
if when it comes to it uh foreclosure is
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
the last last uh means so um thank you
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
for your time i appreciate you allowing
 
01:34:54.629 --> 01:34:54.639 align:start position:0%

uh i'm sure that we'll hear from the
 
01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
banking association and when and if uh
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%

01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
um and seeing no other hands
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%

uh steve
 
01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:18.390 align:start position:0%
uh steve

01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
you could have raised your hand a few
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
minutes ago so we knew that you wanted
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%

01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:26.840 align:start position:0%

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:28.470 align:start position:0%
you are
beyond

01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
the first name of steve but would you
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:36.149 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
and if you could identify uh who you're
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
with or
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
how you are associated with this issue
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
i'm steve bauer i'm the executive
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
director for the mortgage bankers and
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
brokers association of new hampshire
 
01:35:49.199 --> 01:35:49.990 align:start position:0%
brokers association of new hampshire
and

01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:51.669 --> 01:35:51.679 align:start position:0%
i waited to raise by hand because i
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure if kurt stratson our
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
legislative chair was
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
one of the participants in the meeting
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:35:58.480 --> 01:35:59.590 align:start position:0%
or not
so

01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
i'm really here to echo what ryan's
 
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
points are
 
01:36:07.270 --> 01:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
there are a few statistics for
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
the foreclosure starts for q quarter one
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
in 2019 in new hampshire it was
 
01:36:16.709 --> 01:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
0.17 percent
 
01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
and the last
 
01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:20.070 align:start position:0%
and the last
recorded

01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
they have is q1 for 2020 it was 0.14
 
01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
so foreclosures are very low in new
 
01:36:28.639 --> 01:36:29.830 align:start position:0%
so foreclosures are very low in new
hampshire

01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of systems now in
 
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
place through the gses
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
cfpb for complaints and things like that
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
at the federal level
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
so we just see it as
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
something that's really not needed here
 
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
and there
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
if you do go forward with this bill is
 
01:36:48.639 --> 01:36:49.750 align:start position:0%
if you do go forward with this bill is
written

01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
there are quite a few
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
difficulties the way it's written
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
and so i would suggest that that also be
 
01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
reviewed so
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
mortgage bankers and brokers association
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
is in opposition

representative indrik even though your

01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
would um remind us of this bill
 
01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:25.270 align:start position:0%
would um remind us of this bill
and

01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's intense
 
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh sure mr chair thank you
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
as introduced uh the bill is actually
 
01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
based off of the california uh data
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
privacy law that passed a couple years
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
ago and went into effect this year
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
we had subsequently discussed an
 
01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
amendment uh which i believe most of the
 
01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
committee members will recall
 
01:39:50.950 --> 01:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
that sought to take a smaller more
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
bite-sized approach
 
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with internet service providers
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
and basically empowering consumers to
 
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
first of all know what data is collected
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
empowering them with an opt-in
 
01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.590 align:start position:0%
empowering them with an opt-in
right

01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
where they would their personal
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
data would not be sold
 
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
unless they opted into that sale
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
this is based on a law that has passed
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
in maine and i believe went into effect
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
this summer and went through a court
 
01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:24.709 align:start position:0%
this summer and went through a court
challenge

01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:24.719 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
that is still proceeding but it passed
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
the first hurdle
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
and they did the court ruled that there
 
01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
was no primo fascia
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
free speech issue
 
01:40:38.229 --> 01:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
and it is proceeding accordingly so
 
01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
anyway as
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
everybody recalls in 2018 80 percent of
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire voters
 
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
agreed to amend the new hampshire
 
01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:47.669 align:start position:0%
agreed to amend the new hampshire
constitution

01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
to instantiate a right to privacy which
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
has had a long history in our
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh wider jurisprudential history uh
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
dating back to at least brandeis in the
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
late 19th century
 
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
and i think it's incumbent upon
 
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
us short of any action at the federal
 
01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:07.109 align:start position:0%
us short of any action at the federal
level

01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
to do our best to empower consumers here
 
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:11.840 align:start position:0%

01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%

01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
the department of transportation opposes
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
the reason being is that we operate our
 
01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
easy pass system
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
and it's operated through our vendor
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
cubic transportation
 
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
and as part of a ezpass account the
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions we um charge for um
 
01:44:37.990 --> 01:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
statement fees when they're mailed to
 
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.510 align:start position:0%
statement fees when they're mailed to
them

01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
when somebody first signs up for an
 
01:44:43.990 --> 01:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
account we the first year of their roll
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
the customers receive four quarterly
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
statements mailed to them at no charge
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
starting in the second year
 
01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
all the customers are opt-in to
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
electronic mail statements unless they
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
want paper
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
when they want paper statements we
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
charge them a dollar per month if it's
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
an individual account or two dollars for
 
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
a business account
 
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
we also provide them two
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
cds if they want their statement on cds
 
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
and that's three dollars
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
a month
 
01:45:17.590 --> 01:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
at any time the customer is allowed to
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
go back to the email statements
 
01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
and they're also
 
01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
able to get their statements on the web
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
and print them them out on the web too
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
the statement charge is to help us
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
offset for the cost of paper the cd the
 
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
for the past four fiscal years
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 17
 
01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
we collected 31 31 000
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
in statement fees
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
since we were 18 we collected around 46
 
01:45:48.239 --> 01:45:49.030 align:start position:0%
since we were 18 we collected around 46
000

01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 19 it was around 68 000 and
 
01:45:56.470 --> 01:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 was around 73 000
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
um this bill will impact us in revenue
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
and in our budget um we recommend we
 
01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
um some things that we would have to do
 
01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
if this bill was passed we'd have to
 
01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
revise our easy pass system the software
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
which would cost us money the
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
applications and the terms and
 
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.310 align:start position:0%
applications and the terms and
conditions

01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
this will also as mentioned would
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
increase our budget in our contract with
 
01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
cubic in order to pay for the paper the
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
cds the envelopes and the postage and it
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
will also a possibility of a more
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
further impact our budget if customers
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
know these are free they may be
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%

thank you for your testimony and thank
 
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
you for helping us to understand the
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
economics of what's going on here this
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
is a question that might be difficult
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
for you to answer but for the most part
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
how would you characterize the people
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
who are getting the paper statements are
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
they typically elderly are they
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
typically uh non-computer literate to
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
the best of your knowledge how would you
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
characterize that population please
 
01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
um i'm unable to characterize it because
 
01:47:33.189 --> 01:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
on the ez pass statements there is no
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
knowledge of
 
01:47:35.430 --> 01:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's age gender all that
 
01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
um i do know
 
01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:40.709 align:start position:0%
um i do know
um

01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
there's like 956 business accounts that
 
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
opt into this
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
and there's like 780
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
um individual accounts that up into it
 
01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you a lot of people who
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
opt into it the reason they tell us is
 
01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:57.189 align:start position:0%
opt into it the reason they tell us is
because

01:47:57.189 --> 01:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
they need it for their taxes and stuff
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
or expenses with their company
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
and mr corcoran hang around just in case
 
01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679 align:start position:0%

address his concerns i i want uh to
 
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
express in my my legal practice i'm
 
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
honored to represent some court
 
01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:29.430 align:start position:0%
honored to represent some court
appointed

01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
clients and
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
this is the only part of my practice
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
that uh people do request um paper
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
copies or need paper copies from the
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
court and these are my most fragile my
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
elderly or disabled or
 
01:48:44.159 --> 01:48:45.189 align:start position:0%
elderly or disabled or
um

01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
in poverty clients their clients that
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
don't have computers aren't don't have
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
access to email
 
01:48:53.669 --> 01:48:53.679 align:start position:0%
don't have access to a printer even if
 
01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
they do have some type of uh
 
01:48:57.669 --> 01:48:57.679 align:start position:0%
email or
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
internet capacity on their phones they
 
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
they drive to my portsmouth office from
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
places all over stratford and rockingham
 
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
county just to sign a document that i
 
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
printed out and left for them during
 
01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
this covet time so
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
i really feel that this legislation
 
01:49:11.679 --> 01:49:12.950 align:start position:0%
i really feel that this legislation
while

01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know in the um context that um uh
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
the department of transportation has
 
01:49:19.510 --> 01:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
concerns certainly the clients i'm
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
talking about don't even have easy
 
01:49:23.510 --> 01:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
passes or perhaps not even vehicles that
 
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
they could drive to the library and get
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
something printed off from their cell
 
01:49:29.669 --> 01:49:29.679 align:start position:0%
phone so i i do think this is an issue
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
that needs further study i feel like it
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
falls on
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable and fragile
 
01:49:38.709 --> 01:49:38.719 align:start position:0%
financially in our communities and i
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
think it's a cost that we all should
 
01:49:40.239 --> 01:49:41.350 align:start position:0%
think it's a cost that we all should
bear

01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
bear
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to bear the cost of printing
 
01:49:46.629 --> 01:49:46.639 align:start position:0%
off for these people so that it's not a
 
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
spiral of increased fares and compounded
 
01:49:53.109 --> 01:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
fines um so it is a bill that i do think
 
01:49:55.669 --> 01:49:55.679 align:start position:0%
has an issue i think has
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of worth to it again may not go
 
01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:00.639 align:start position:0%
this time but it is something that i'd
 
01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
hate to see the committee recommend is
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
not an issue that we need to look at
 
01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
just because it might not affect us
 
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
i i think this bill uh like some of the
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
other ones that we've discussed the last
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
two days
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
has a kernel of value but structurally
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
01:50:31.109 --> 01:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
um this one especially because it's part
 
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
of the consumer protection act
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
and as we as those of you who have been
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
in this committee for a while no the
 
01:50:39.669 --> 01:50:39.679 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act
 
01:50:39.679 --> 01:50:40.550 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act
really

01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
requires the attorney general to enforce
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general is not going to
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
act on behalf of individual
 
01:50:47.199 --> 01:50:49.189 align:start position:0%
act on behalf of individual
consumers

01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
if there is a
 
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a large tort case
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh they might step in but otherwise
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
you're you're kind of on your own and
 
01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:00.070 align:start position:0%
you're you're kind of on your own and
for

01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh paper billing fees you're not going
 
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
to spend what it costs to go to
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
superior court so
 
01:51:08.709 --> 01:51:08.719 align:start position:0%
this is kind of unenforceable the way
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's written
 
01:51:12.070 --> 01:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh the second element of of it being
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
part of the consumer protection act is
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
that banks are exempt
 
01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
i think one of in the testimony that i
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
recall one of the
 
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
places where there was the most
 
01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
complaints were the idea that you know
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
you have a checking account and if you
 
01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
want paper versions of your
 
01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:32.070 align:start position:0%
want paper versions of your
uh

01:51:32.070 --> 01:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
monthly statements you have to pay for
 
01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:35.109 align:start position:0%
monthly statements you have to pay for
those

01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
um but this wouldn't apply to banks
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
because they're exempt from consumer
 
01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
protection so
 
01:51:41.199 --> 01:51:42.149 align:start position:0%
protection so
i

01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
while i would agree with uh
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative macbeth that you know
 
01:51:47.510 --> 01:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
there there ought to be options for
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
people who
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
have difficulty either obtaining things
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
electronically because they
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
either don't have the equipment or the
 
01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:56.790 align:start position:0%
either don't have the equipment or the
knowledge

01:51:56.790 --> 01:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
01:51:59.350 --> 01:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
and also be so that people don't
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
have to pay for things that they normal
 
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
that they in the past were able to get
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
for free
 
01:52:07.510 --> 01:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh and therefore you know add an extra
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
burden to their
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh expenses
 
01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:11.430 align:start position:0%
uh expenses
um

01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:12.870 --> 01:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:52:14.709 --> 01:52:14.719 align:start position:0%
somebody has to come up with a totally
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
different way of structuring this and
 
01:52:20.310 --> 01:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
and uh in our audience is uh
 
01:52:24.239 --> 01:52:25.430 align:start position:0%
and uh in our audience is uh
representative

01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
walls mary beth walls uh represent mr
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
corcoran thank you for uh your
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
commentary i think uh
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh we have no more questions uh
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:41.350 --> 01:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
so my
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
is it my turn
 
01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
it is your turn thank you um i'd like to
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh piggyback on what representative
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
mcpheeth has said um
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
i signed on to this bill i'm not the
 
01:52:53.669 --> 01:52:53.679 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor i'm a co-sponsor but i
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
signed on to this bill pretty quickly
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
when i learned about it because i think
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
charging for paper statements is really
 
01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
just a tax on the poor and on the
 
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
elderly on those that have for either
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
economic reasons or because of their age
 
01:53:08.229 --> 01:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
or even in some cases because of
 
01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
disability not been able to adapt to
 
01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
the electronic age like most of us have
 
01:53:15.910 --> 01:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
and all of us here sitting on this call
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
obviously have been able to figure that
 
01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
out and i think that's just wrong and so
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
i would like to see this proceed
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
i think there are ways to do it perhaps
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
we exempt government agencies if i mean
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
it's obviously a significant money maker
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
for the department of transportation as
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
somebody who sits on finance i know how
 
01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
desperately the department of
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
transportation needs money and i support
 
01:53:40.229 --> 01:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
anything that gets them money almost
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
but i think that there are ways to do it
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
i don't sit on your committee and i
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
don't fully understand representative
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
williams concerns about it being part of
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act but it seems
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
to me that there has to be a way to do
 
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
this perhaps outside the consumer
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
protection act we can deal with
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
legislative services but i do think that
 
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
we should recommend this for further
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
legislation and i think that we should
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
be going forward with it perhaps in a
 
01:54:07.350 --> 01:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
new form now that we understand some of
 
01:54:09.669 --> 01:54:09.679 align:start position:0%
the challenges but i do think that it's
 
01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:16.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that commentary
 
01:54:18.550 --> 01:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative walls
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
before uh
 
01:54:24.629 --> 01:54:24.639 align:start position:0%
she uh goes back into the audience
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you
 
01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:30.629 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:54:30.629 --> 01:54:30.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
i see no more hands although i do want
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
to let you know that
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
representative wazir
 
01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
who was a prime sponsor uh
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
says that her kids are crying in the
 
01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
background so she can't join us
 
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
but that she hopes that we will support
 
01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:52.149 align:start position:0%
the bill
and

01:54:52.149 --> 01:54:52.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:52.159 --> 01:54:53.030 align:start position:0%
and
that

01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
she believes that the
 
01:54:58.149 --> 01:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
like representative walls that the costs
 
01:54:58.159 --> 01:54:59.350 align:start position:0%
like representative walls that the costs
are

01:54:59.350 --> 01:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
considering that
 
01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:07.740 align:start position:0%
considering that
um

01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:07.750 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:09.510 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:55:09.510 --> 01:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
i will move uh that we recommend 1690
 
01:55:17.109 --> 01:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
for future legislation
 
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
a second
