room I was here my terms in the house
 
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
2008 to 12 and I'd say you know not much
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
has changed but it's good to be here and
 
00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 align:start position:0%
I'm introducing uh Senate Bill 12
 
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
relative to the leasing of seasonal
 
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.210 align:start position:0%
relative to the leasing of seasonal
camps

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
camps
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
a lots by the fishing game uh Department
 
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
this is a bill on behalf of the
 
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.270 align:start position:0%
this is a bill on behalf of the
department

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
um and it uh maintains the fish and game
 
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
Department's handling of State leases
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
and and it makes them consistent now
 
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
with other state agencies in terms of
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
the length of a lease that can be put
 
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
forward by by making that consistent at
 
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
the five five not more than five uh
 
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.810 align:start position:0%
the five five not more than five uh
years

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
um right now under RSA 12 212 10B says
 
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
any at least for buildings or lands is
 
00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
longer than cumulative period of 30 days
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
must be administered in accordance with
 
00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
RSA 440
 
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
and take a look at that and you can see
 
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
the paperwork involved multi-layered
 
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
lengthy process of approval Eleven
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
Hundred Dollar administrative charge to
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
the lessee
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
for each renewable release give me a
 
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
break sorry that's an aside the proposed
 
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
change will have the language mirror
 
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
what exists in RSA 439 Ford colon 39.
 
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
and that's State leases are up to five
 
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
years before needing approval of the
 
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
governor and Council and the long-range
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
Capital planning committee but let me
 
00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
know that if the lease you know is uh
 
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
going to be over five years in the 7 500
 
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
then it goes to Governor Council like
 
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
every other lease which it what it
 
00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
should do now um let's get to why this
 
00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 align:start position:0%
is really important for the Department
 
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
to have this um they currently manage
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
the seasonal Camp lease program for the
 
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes Natural Area up in the
 
00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 align:start position:0%
north country
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
um those leases are allowed for up to
 
00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
five years
 
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
um don't require that process
 
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
um but we have also the department of
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
seasonal Camp wants
 
00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:10.139 align:start position:0%
um they own some and they you know might
 
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
be acquiring another one and uh for
 
00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
those as they come in ought to be under
 
00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:16.979 align:start position:0%
this five-year system and I think that
 
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
if you're visiting the fish and game Run
 
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.730 align:start position:0%
if you're visiting the fish and game Run
operations

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
um these are great they're opportunity
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
for families they mean that these these
 
00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:25.259 align:start position:0%
Camp Watts instead of being sold for
 
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
development or some other thing that
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
they they their uses get maintained
 
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
people can can use them and that's why
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
they like to go up to the up to the
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
north uh North Country
 
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
um and what it does it means it'll allow
 
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
the department if it requires property
 
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
that have existing camps
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
um that'll streamline the Department's
 
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
efforts regulate them and provide a more
 
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
efficient approach for managing uh
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
renewals so this bill was uh worked up
 
00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
by Dan Bergeron who's here chief of
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
wildlife fish and game and uh Betsy
 
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
McNaughton land agent for the department
 
00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
they can ask her ask you know answer any
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
more questions that you might have about
 
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
the details of it but um this makes a
 
00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:05.699 align:start position:0%
lot of sense to me thank you Mr chairman
 
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
you're recognized
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
hi representative Morton from Amherst
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering you mentioned the
 
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes region is already
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
Under The Five-Year and about how many
 
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
Lots or or sites is that and then
 
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
changing this to everyone going to five
 
00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:32.459 align:start position:0%
year how many more does that add to the
 
00:08:32.459 --> 00:08:33.290 align:start position:0%
year how many more does that add to the
process

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:35.339 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I'm gonna let um the
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
department talk to that but I'll just
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
say that I mentioned that because that's
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
an example of what is successful and as
 
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
consistent with the other the other way
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
the way other state agencies do things
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's saying that works let's
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
let it work for the other ones and they
 
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
can tell you about the actual number of
 
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
lots that we're talking about
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you thank you and
 
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
uh representative Khan

thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question Senator
 
00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
can you tell us that how this uh uh bill
 
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.190 align:start position:0%
can you tell us that how this uh uh bill
was

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
taken by the Senate you know when you
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
had your hearing
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh unanimous in committee and consent on
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
the floor thank you yeah
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
thank you uh any other questions
 
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
representative Ming
 
00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:28.019 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:28.910 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
Senator the uh in the in the first
 
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
paragraph it says short-term short-term
 
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
use of buildings or lands
 
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.550 align:start position:0%
use of buildings or lands
um

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
that existed when the period was 30 days
 
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:41.810 align:start position:0%
that existed when the period was 30 days
um

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
by not CH by not taking that out is
 
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
there any implication
 
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.630 align:start position:0%
there any implication
um

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:50.449 --> 00:09:50.459 align:start position:0%
by increasing the five-year limit to
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm asking it does the does
 
00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
the definition of short-term change by
 
00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.990 align:start position:0%
the definition of short-term change by
increasing

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your question
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative I I I don't I don't think
 
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
so I mean people can at least for as
 
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
long as they want to lose but it's just
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
saying that you know the pre the statute
 
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
now says that if it's more than 30 days
 
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
you've got to go through that whole
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
process and do it again where if you
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
want to go up to five years hey this is
 
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
that's what we do with other state
 
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
agencies and you'd be able to do it here
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
too okay but I think there may be some
 
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
more details there and
 
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:29.700 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
thank you uh do you have a follow-up uh
 
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
not a follow-up but a different question
 
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you Mr chair
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
um so this has to do with um the fact
 
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
that it references a contract and a
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
lease is there any intent to contract
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
out of
 
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
um any issue that doesn't have to do
 
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
with leasing the land
 
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
but that's the question I'm going to let
 
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
the depart okay all right sure thank you
 
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions
 
00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Senator thank you
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:03.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:07.740 align:start position:0%
chair now recognizes Dan Bergeron from
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh fish and game
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Spillane members
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee um thank you for having
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
me testify here before you today I'm the
 
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
chief of the wildlife division at New
 
00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:19.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Fish and Game department
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters did a great job
 
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
summarizing why we we brought this bill
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
forward so I'll try and make mine a
 
00:11:30.009 --> 00:11:30.019 align:start position:0%
little bit more brief I can speak to
 
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
your question in terms of how many so
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't really look for
 
00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:38.339 align:start position:0%
properties that have camps or any other
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
buildings on them that said we also
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to be prevented from
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
obtaining good conservation land or
 
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
wildlife habitat just because a seasonal
 
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
Camp is there so we have there's a three
 
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
camps on the Connecticut Lakes Natural
 
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
Area we have two other camps on
 
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
different properties we're in the
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
process of obtaining another property
 
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:01.940 align:start position:0%
that would have a sixth Camp
 
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
these camps typically in the northern
 
00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
part of the state they're part of the
 
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
culture and the Heritage up there so we
 
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
would like to be able to maintain that
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
those when possible and again this this
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
bill would streamline our process
 
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
because now we're working under two
 
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
different sets of rsas one for our
 
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
Connecticut lakes and then one for
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
everything else this would make
 
00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:25.019 align:start position:0%
everything language on all these
 
00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
consistent the process consistent it
 
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
would make it consistent with other
 
00:12:33.769 --> 00:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
agencies dncr D.O.T all have similar
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
language in there in their rsas in terms
 
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
of how they deal with properties like
 
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.430 align:start position:0%
of how they deal with properties like
this

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
and I believe you had some handout for
 
00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:44.459 align:start position:0%
everybody yes I have tested my written
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
testimony here if you could hand that to
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
representative Ming he'll take one and
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
hand it down thank you
 
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for uh Mr
 
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
Bergeron yes uh
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
you can go Carol
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh good morning
 
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question I'm
 
00:13:05.329 --> 00:13:05.339 align:start position:0%
following up on what rep representative
 
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
Ming asked is there
 
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
is there and is there a definition of
 
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
short-term use of buildings and does
 
00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
this allow someone to rent one of these
 
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:17.180 align:start position:0%
camps for five years
 
00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of a definition of
 
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:21.180 align:start position:0%
short-term use
 
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.250 align:start position:0%
short-term use
um

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
similar to what Senator Waters had
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
pointed out this would make language
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
consistent you could go up to five years
 
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
but it certainly could be shorter than
 
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you so so a a a single
 
00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
entity can lease for five years yes one
 
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:44.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
and go ahead representative Smith thank
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
question how many properties now
 
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
be the leased or contracted are for
 
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
periods more than 30 days is it all of
 
00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.430 align:start position:0%
periods more than 30 days is it all of
them

00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:00.899 align:start position:0%
I'll look to Betsy McNaughton who's our
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
land agent she would be more familiar
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
if she'd like to join you at the table
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman I'm Betsy
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
McNaughton I'm the land agent I'm the
 
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
one who administers these at uh fish and
 
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.310 align:start position:0%
one who administers these at uh fish and
game

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
game
 
00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sorry repeat your question
 
00:14:20.579 --> 00:14:22.190 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sorry repeat your question
again

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
how many of how many Parcels or
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
properties that at least are contracted
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
for are for periods of longer than 30
 
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.690 align:start position:0%
for are for periods of longer than 30
days

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
all of the camp leases seasonal Camp
 
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
leases are um there they are longer than
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
30 days
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
um I usually do a lease document for
 
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
four years and talking about the
 
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes that's the one that's
 
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
been in place for
 
00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
I want to say 20 years
 
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
um so I do the lease document for four
 
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
years and within that lease document
 
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
there's a payment schedule for those
 
00:14:54.129 --> 00:14:54.139 align:start position:0%
four years
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
and then the other three two
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
Camp lots that we own as well and plus
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
this one coming on soon will be the next
 
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.889 align:start position:0%
this one coming on soon will be the next
three

00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:03.899 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:06.110 align:start position:0%
three
um

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
we haven't had them long enough to I
 
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
mean they've they've gone through the
 
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
what I've called the chord process which
 
00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:15.899 align:start position:0%
is the 440 the RSA 440 process with long
 
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
range and cord
 
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
um they've gone through it I think twice
 
00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.009 align:start position:0%
um they've gone through it I think twice
so

00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:22.019 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
can I also make one clarification
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
camps they own the building we own the
 
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
land underneath
 
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
um so they're leasing the space where
 
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
the building is and this has been
 
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:48.829 align:start position:0%
the building is and this has been
um

00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
they've been in the families for
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
generations and so it's not that we're
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
changing uh leases every five years
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
we're these these leases have been
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
consistent with the family members that
 
00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:04.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
so I'll take an opportunity to ask a
 
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
question myself because that was very
 
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
clarifying and it's something I didn't
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
get from the previous discussion so this
 
00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:14.459 align:start position:0%
is more like um a mobile home park where
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
they own the state is owning the land
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
underneath but the people own the
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
building on top of it yeah except for
 
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
they're not mobile homes well I
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
understand but it's the same methodology
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
where the the lease is required because
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
they're on the property that they don't
 
00:16:31.009 --> 00:16:31.019 align:start position:0%
own but the building is theirs yes so
 
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
they're required to do all the
 
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the building
 
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
but they have to have the the leasing
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
through the state because of the land
 
00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:41.339 align:start position:0%
use correct correct
 
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
representative Ming you're recognized
 
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I guess I'll just
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
ask my question again about contract
 
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
versus lease is there anything that's
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
going to be contracted that doesn't have
 
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
to do with
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
um the land or the buildings
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
not that I'm aware of okay so uh
 
00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:09.409 align:start position:0%
not that I'm aware of okay so uh
follow-up

00:17:09.409 --> 00:17:09.419 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:11.459 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:12.710 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
um

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
so I I would just anticipate that it's
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
for flexibilities sake
 
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
um to specify contract because contract
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
is kind of a bigger term right right
 
00:17:27.169 --> 00:17:27.179 align:start position:0%
um Elise is a type of contract
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
but a contract is not a type of lease
 
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.470 align:start position:0%
but a contract is not a type of lease
that

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
that's just my question that it only has
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
to do with the buildings in the land
 
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Ouellette
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
followed by representative Khan
 
00:17:45.049 --> 00:17:45.059 align:start position:0%
just to make a statement and clarify a
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
little bit what they said the lease of
 
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
camps has gone on for Generations up in
 
00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
the North Country much of it was done
 
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.270 align:start position:0%
the North Country much of it was done
through

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
Paper Company lands where you actually
 
00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
built your Camp rented a piece of
 
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
property and and it's been like that for
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
a hundred years so this isn't something
 
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
new or something they've done it's a
 
00:18:06.289 --> 00:18:06.299 align:start position:0%
tradition in North Country it's been
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
going on for Generations
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
thank you all right representative Khan
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh my question is if
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
this uh Senate Bill 12 passes is there
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
any extra cost to the department or the
 
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
no there would be no additional cost
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
this would actually streamline the
 
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh thank you very much for
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
your testimony today thank you is there
 
00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
anybody in here who has not had a chance
 
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
to speak who wishes to do so
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
not seeing anyone I'm going to close the
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
hearing a public hearing on sb12
 
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
and it is
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
time to open up the hearing on sb18
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
I'll recognize the prime sponsor rep
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm trying to get
 
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
used to that myself
 
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman um and committee members
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you it's great to be back in this
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
room uh it's been uh I did want to walk
 
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
up to my chair Mr chairman and take my
 
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
seat again but I guess I realize I'm on
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
this side of the microphone over here
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
um so I'm introducing Senate bill 18.
 
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
this is essentially a housekeeping
 
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
measure that does two things first it
 
00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
allows for electronic or email
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
confirmation of a duck stamp purchased
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
in lieu of an actual physical stamp the
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
intent is to be consistent with Federal
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
practice that allows for an electronic
 
00:19:48.289 --> 00:19:48.299 align:start position:0%
stamp as well as take into consideration
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
off the lengthy time that it takes
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
between the purchase of a duck stamp and
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
the actual physical receipt getting it
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
for the hunter the second thing this
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
does is clean up some statute it
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
includes a in a conviction of an
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
unlawful discharge with firearm within
 
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
an urban area a compact urban area which
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
is governed by RSA 64413 as the grounds
 
00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:12.539 align:start position:0%
for suspension of a revocation of a
 
00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:15.059 align:start position:0%
license issued by Fish and Game
 
00:20:16.909 --> 00:20:16.919 align:start position:0%
the intent is to create consistency
 
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
between the violation of RSA 207 colon
 
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
3-a which prohibits the discharge of
 
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
firearm within 300 feet of a dwelling in
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
a violation results in the suspension
 
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
revocation and the same violation as the
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
same violation in RSA
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
64413 that does not result in suspension
 
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
we need to First make uh make this
 
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
change in law so that we can clean up
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
the rules to be consistent on the
 
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
application of the penalty there is
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
somebody here from fish and game but
 
00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
again the biggest part of this is again
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
it simplifies the licensing process for
 
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
our hunters and fishermen in our state
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
and the second thing it does it puts the
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
discharge of a weapon in a cartilage and
 
00:20:58.970 --> 00:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
a dischargeable weapon in a compact or
 
00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:02.220 align:start position:0%
Urban compact area on on par with each
 
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
other that will result in the suspension
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
of a license
 
00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions but this is
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
also the major over here we'll probably
 
00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:12.059 align:start position:0%
answer the questions way better than me
 
00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony Senator are
 
00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:18.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much damn I'm
 
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.810 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much damn I'm
good

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:57.010 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:57.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
the chair calls major Dave Walsh from
 
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman Mr committee my
 
00:22:06.289 --> 00:22:06.299 align:start position:0%
name is Dave Walsh I am the assistant
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
chief of law enforcement for fish and
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
game as Senator Lang said this is a
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
housekeeping measure the first part uh
 
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
just to give you a brief introduction
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
anybody who waterfowl hunts in New
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has to buy a federal stamp
 
00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
currently the law in New Hampshire is
 
00:22:21.169 --> 00:22:21.179 align:start position:0%
you must have that on your person before
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
you hunt now the federal government
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
sells these stamps online and they give
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
you an electronic confirmation that you
 
00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:30.539 align:start position:0%
bought it but we the way Allah is
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
written prohibits people from using that
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
electronic confirmation so this cleans
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
it up so if you go out and buy a stamp
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
online you could hunt that day because
 
00:22:39.169 --> 00:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
you get that electronic confirmation and
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
you have 45 days until the stamp comes
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
in the mail so it makes it easier for
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
hunters and then the second part is the
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
discharge of a firearm in a compact Zone
 
00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
currently we don't have the ability to
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
suspend a license so if somebody shoots
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
a firearm while hunting in a playground
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
for example in an urban area if they're
 
00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
not technically within 300 feet of a
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
building would have to charge them with
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
another stat with the statute and we
 
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to suspend for them so
 
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
it cleans up the the suspension um for
 
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
discharging while hunting in a compact
 
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.649 align:start position:0%
discharging while hunting in a compact
Zone

00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for the major
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
all right did you have one
 
00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative thank you Mr
 
00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.770 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative thank you Mr
chair

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
um I read this last night over again so
 
00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
maybe it was late and maybe I'm asking a
 
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
should 207 colon 3A that's firearm
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
discharge while hunting for 300 feet is
 
00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
there a reason that isn't in here or
 
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
should it be in here so we have the
 
00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:45.059 align:start position:0%
ability to spend for that violation but
 
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
there are instances where somebody could
 
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
not violate that but still be within a
 
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
compact Zone okay so it doesn't need to
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
be referenced in the in this bill it
 
00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
does not okay thank you very much thank
 
00:23:57.179 --> 00:23:58.130 align:start position:0%
does not okay thank you very much thank
you

00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:58.140 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions okay then
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
I have one
 
00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.890 align:start position:0%
I have one
major

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
major
 
00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding from uh
 
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
experience hunting waterfowl myself that
 
00:24:12.049 --> 00:24:12.059 align:start position:0%
you need to print your signature across
 
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
that duck stamp to make it valid and to
 
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
also basically it's the same as a
 
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
cancellation Mark in the post office
 
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
uh it's yours now and I know that in
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
stamp collecting the ones without a
 
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
signature are worth a lot more than the
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
ones that have been signed and so I'm
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
just wondering if this allowing you to
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
use an electronic copy that has no
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
signature would allow them to then take
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
the duck stamp without a signature and
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
put it away somewhere and save it as a
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
more valuable thing and not have their
 
00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:42.419 align:start position:0%
signature attached has the federal
 
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:43.740 align:start position:0%
government changed the regulations
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
regarding signing the stamps and is
 
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
there a way that
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
um we're handling that excellent
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
question so no the way the the federal
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
government and the way this law is
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
written is that electronic confirmation
 
00:24:57.169 --> 00:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
is good for 45 days when you get your
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
license or stamp in the mail then you
 
00:24:59.930 --> 00:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
have to put it on your license and sign
 
00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.250 align:start position:0%
have to put it on your license and sign
it

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:01.260 align:start position:0%

legal correct correct and the only folks

00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
and I will close the exact session on
 
00:34:12.839 --> 00:34:15.050 align:start position:0%
and I will close the exact session on
sb18

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
sb18
 
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:17.220 align:start position:0%
we still have 15 minutes before we can
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
start uh the next bill so you all can
 
00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:41.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
I'll take the opportunity while
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
everyone's here to and we're on a break
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
here to mention to everybody that uh did
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
some research that the committee
 
00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
researcher has dropped off uh there's a
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
third item that he's working on before
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
we exec uh other bills
 
00:34:59.450 --> 00:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
um that will show a comparison and
 
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
contrast between the Midwest hunting
 
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
style and the Northeast hunting style uh
 
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
and the benefits and drawbacks to each
 
00:35:07.849 --> 00:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
of those Styles
 
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
um what we've got here is uh what I
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
requested as far as uh providing for
 
00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:14.339 align:start position:0%
your information what's currently
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
prohibited within 300 feet of an
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
occupied dwelling what the current
 
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
season is for night hunting coyote and
 
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
um what current things are required to
 
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
have your name or identification
 
00:35:29.329 --> 00:35:29.339 align:start position:0%
attached as far as hunting gear and then
 
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
um all of the information about current
 
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
use and the important part that you'll
 
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
want to pay attention to is the last
 
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
page where it talks about the 20 extra
 
00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.310 align:start position:0%
page where it talks about the 20 extra
discount

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
discount
 
00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
those are the areas that may come into
 
00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
play in your mind and so there's some
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.170 align:start position:0%
 
we

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:50.990 align:start position:0%
we
didn't

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:42.290 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:46.690 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:46.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things I passed
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
my researcher could do is to dig up a
 
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
comparison with it because a lot of
 
00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:54.730 align:start position:0%
comparison with it because a lot of
people

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:54.740 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:37:58.089 --> 00:37:58.099 align:start position:0%
don't know about hunting in the midwest
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
it's a totally different methodology and
 
00:38:04.609 --> 00:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
we like our open land right
 
00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
out there everything is quite proficient
 
00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
only unless it's public land and it's
 
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
out in the midwest what you find is uh
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
welcome people put the different private
 
00:38:16.609 --> 00:38:16.619 align:start position:0%
plans right and everyone else's praying
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
about our public work
 
00:38:18.119 --> 00:38:20.829 align:start position:0%
about our public work
um

00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:23.089 --> 00:38:23.099 align:start position:0%
do you know which beginning that kind of
 
00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:25.460 align:start position:0%
information so he can provide
 
00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.750 align:start position:0%
information so he can provide
okay

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.849 --> 00:38:31.859 align:start position:0%

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
committee Senator David Waters District
 
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
4 introducing Senate bill 14
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
at the request to The Fish and Game
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
Commission uh provides guidance and
 
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
clarification on the use of game cameras
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
for hunting
 
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
um I say it's at the requested apartment
 
00:51:47.809 --> 00:51:47.819 align:start position:0%
but really this is an issue that we all
 
00:51:50.569 --> 00:51:50.579 align:start position:0%
have been working on for several years
 
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
um I hope that a lot of this looks
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
familiar to you from House Bill 490
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
which I I think got us a long way
 
00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
towards where we needed to be on this
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
but we just couldn't get there in a
 
00:52:01.569 --> 00:52:01.579 align:start position:0%
committee conference
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
so um let me just step back for a moment
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
I feel like I'm on the game camera right
 
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
now but you can't come get me for 24
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
hours all right
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
um anyways uh let me just talk a little
 
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
bit about the background here what the
 
00:52:17.809 --> 00:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
what the larger issues are and why I
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
think you know Senator Pearl and the and
 
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
the department and everybody else who
 
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
worked on the Senate we came up with
 
00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:25.140 align:start position:0%
something for you to I think you can
 
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
work with too
 
00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:27.829 align:start position:0%
work with too
um

00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
you know as I said I've been a member I
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
was members of the committee I'm a
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
strong supporter of hunting
 
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
and hunting rights in the state and this
 
00:52:37.069 --> 00:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
new technology has come in and it is it
 
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
is useful for hunting and I think that
 
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
there needs that needs to be recognized
 
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
as something useful for hunters
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
we also know you know New Hampshire
 
00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
folks are pretty pretty uh set on their
 
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
privacy aren't they especially on their
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
property and so you know they are upset
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
a lot we heard a lot because people are
 
00:52:59.329 --> 00:52:59.339 align:start position:0%
finding game cameras and wondering well
 
00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:01.859 align:start position:0%
what can they record uh on on the
 
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
property and who's who's doing this to
 
00:53:05.569 --> 00:53:05.579 align:start position:0%
know what happens with those images
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
so you know this is one of those ones
 
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
where you have to do really two
 
00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
conflicting um things here and and what
 
00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
do we do about it so what we did in the
 
00:53:13.859 --> 00:53:14.990 align:start position:0%
do we do about it so what we did in the
bill

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:53:16.849 --> 00:53:16.859 align:start position:0%
was we you know did some definitional
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
work on a game camera
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
um then importantly a 24-hour time frame
 
00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
between viewing wildlife and then taking
 
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
that animal which I think kind of makes
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
sense for you know Fair hunt Fair Chase
 
00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.730 align:start position:0%
sense for you know Fair hunt Fair Chase
principles

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
principles
 
00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
um then as uh we move on to the kind of
 
00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
management of this
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
that annual written or posted permission
 
00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
so if you you know it's always good if
 
00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
you're going to hunt somebody's land
 
00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
have a relationship with that landowner
 
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:46.309 align:start position:0%
have a relationship with that landowner
right

00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
um so this would be that you would go
 
00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
and you know do I have permission
 
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:52.140 align:start position:0%
and you have a relationship with that
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
person you'd probably tell them where
 
00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
you're going to put your camera and so
 
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
on and so forth and explain it to them
 
00:53:57.290 --> 00:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
and then you can get the written
 
00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.270 align:start position:0%
and then you can get the written
permission

00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
permission
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
a landowner may just decide to post
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
that it's okay
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
you know the game cameras are all right
 
00:54:06.839 --> 00:54:07.849 align:start position:0%
you know the game cameras are all right
here

00:54:07.849 --> 00:54:07.859 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:54:07.859 --> 00:54:08.510 align:start position:0%
here
um

00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.370 align:start position:0%
um
then

00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
require the cameras to be labeled with a
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
name and contact information of the
 
00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
owner and that really addresses the fact
 
00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
that we need information because then it
 
00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
should only be a law or conservation
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
officer that seizes unauthorized cameras
 
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
and I think that's often important
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
because of the property rights issues
 
00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
that we can get in if somebody goes out
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
a property owner goes out there or
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
somebody else and takes down a camera
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
you know it is somebody's property and
 
00:54:43.849 --> 00:54:43.859 align:start position:0%
that can that can create some problems
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
so if you find a camera you can report
 
00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
it all our conservation officer can come
 
00:54:48.599 --> 00:54:49.370 align:start position:0%
it all our conservation officer can come
out

00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:49.380 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:52.740 align:start position:0%
uh remove it and uh they would have the
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
contact information
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
there to do that
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
um then there are some exceptions here
 
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
that you'll see in the bill scientific
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
permits warrants Fish and Game staff and
 
00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:04.980 align:start position:0%
so on which is you know what you would
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
expect and then there's a penalty
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
established for violations here
 
00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
um as we heard in the Senate and I'm
 
00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
sure you heard on 490 last year
 
00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
um this this use of game cameras has
 
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
become a really major concern for land
 
00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.549 align:start position:0%
become a really major concern for land
owners

00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
owners
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
fish and game was receiving lots of
 
00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
complaints we didn't really have a ways
 
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
to manage this problem
 
00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:34.140 align:start position:0%
um and so we thought it was we put the
 
00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
bill together we might have a way to
 
00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:39.180 align:start position:0%
satisfy those competing needs and
 
00:55:41.089 --> 00:55:41.099 align:start position:0%
provide some it's enforceable and
 
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable for fish and game
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
landowners and Hunters I do want to note
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
in the Senate the New Hampshire Farm
 
00:55:48.119 --> 00:55:49.370 align:start position:0%
in the Senate the New Hampshire Farm
Bureau

00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
Bureau
 
00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
supports it Timberland Association
 
00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
supports it
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire Wildlife Federation
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
along with fish and games so I think
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
would you know you get those folks to
 
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:00.770 align:start position:0%
would you know you get those folks to
say

00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
that this really protects um landowners
 
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
rights and uh and and and funding
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
hunting as well I think we we've got a
 
00:56:10.609 --> 00:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
pretty good place Colonel Jordan is here
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
who can talk a lot about their
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
experience with game cameras the kind of
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
complaints they're getting the issues
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
they're running into and why the way we
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
put together
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
the details of this I think will work so
 
00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
glad to take any questions uh on it and
 
00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:26.809 align:start position:0%
glad to take any questions uh on it and
um

00:56:26.809 --> 00:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman are there any
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
questions for Senator Waters
 
00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
okay I have one myself yes
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
um Senator Waters we've heard uh some
 
00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
people via email and such that are
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
hesitant with putting their name on the
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
camera they don't have a problem with a
 
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
phone number
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
um but we also heard from fish and game
 
00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
that they would be happy to entertain
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
the fact that somebody could write their
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
license number their hunting license
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
number on there which makes it
 
00:56:59.329 --> 00:56:59.339 align:start position:0%
identifiable if somebody calls fish and
 
00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
game and says it's this license number
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
they can figure out who it is but it
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
prevents somebody from being doxxed by
 
00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:07.140 align:start position:0%
an anti-hunter if they don't have their
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
name on there where it says name and
 
00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
contact information in the bill would
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
you be open to that being modified to
 
00:57:16.609 --> 00:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
just say uh somehow they're identifying
 
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
information and phone number thanks
 
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
sounds like a good idea to me thank you
 
00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
uh I do have a follow-up question uh the
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
section that does not prohibit and has
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
all the exceptions in it I heard from
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
some landowners that would still like to
 
00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
know that fish and games putting a
 
00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
camera on their property or that uh
 
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
you know any of these other reasons is
 
00:57:41.809 --> 00:57:41.819 align:start position:0%
there a reason why the landowner is not
 
00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
being notified if it's a fish and game
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
looking for a an animal and wanted to do
 
00:57:48.049 --> 00:57:48.059 align:start position:0%
some research on their property or if
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's a scientist putting a camera out or
 
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
any of these other situations because I
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
heard from some landowners that said
 
00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:54.839 align:start position:0%
yeah this is well and good but I want to
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
know efficient games doing it too
 
00:57:59.210 --> 00:57:59.220 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks for that on it's an
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
interesting point
 
00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
um and I think Colonel Jordan and others
 
00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:05.579 align:start position:0%
will address it I I do think that
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
you know when you get into that let's
 
00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
consider carefully if it's a warrant
 
00:58:14.809 --> 00:58:14.819 align:start position:0%
you know maybe you don't want to do that
 
00:58:17.329 --> 00:58:17.339 align:start position:0%
um if there are some other purposes
 
00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:20.460 align:start position:0%
but I I think that that probably could
 
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
be wiggled to to deal with the concern
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
that you're mentioning while also
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
protecting the kind of needs of the
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
department in law enforcement
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
thank you and anybody else have a
 
00:58:37.789 --> 00:58:37.799 align:start position:0%
question now yes uh representative Smith
 
00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you senator
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I I have a two or
 
00:58:44.569 --> 00:58:44.579 align:start position:0%
three questions which I just go with
 
00:58:44.579 --> 00:58:45.710 align:start position:0%
three questions which I just go with
them

00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
one at a time I'll give you follow-ups
 
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
as needed
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on uh the Chairman's
 
00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:52.549 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on uh the Chairman's
comments

00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:58:52.559 --> 00:58:53.829 align:start position:0%
comments
um

00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
regarding actually let me just go back
 
00:59:00.289 --> 00:59:00.299 align:start position:0%
a lot of landowners are absentee
 
00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
landowners large tracts of land they're
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
not present don't you think this will be
 
00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:05.220 align:start position:0%
logistical headache for them to try to
 
00:59:07.609 --> 00:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
accommodate say 100 200 requests for
 
00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
game cam replacements
 
00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
that's your question
 
00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:14.990 align:start position:0%
that's your question
um

00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
you know if they're absentee I mean it's
 
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
an interesting thought I mean I I'm kind
 
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:21.180 align:start position:0%
of pausing because I it's hard for me to
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
imagine 100 200 requests I mean you know
 
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
how Hunters are when they stake out
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
there where they're going to hunt and
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
they're very they're very careful about
 
00:59:29.809 --> 00:59:29.819 align:start position:0%
what we're looking and where they hunt
 
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
maybe have for several years and where
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
they're gonna Place their cameras so
 
00:59:34.559 --> 00:59:35.270 align:start position:0%
they're gonna Place their cameras so
um

00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
and I would say if you're an absentee
 
00:59:37.079 --> 00:59:38.150 align:start position:0%
and I would say if you're an absentee
landlord

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
maybe you just put out that's one reason
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
of the permission thing you just posted
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
you want to put your camera out go ahead
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
if you don't like that idea then people
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
can contact you and you know you're if
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
you're the owner of record and
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
I mean I I
 
00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:55.609 align:start position:0%
I mean I I
I

00:59:55.609 --> 00:59:55.619 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
I'm really afraid that we're going to
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
get to a situation where more and more
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
land is unavailable for hunting
 
01:00:03.049 --> 01:00:03.059 align:start position:0%
you know and and keeping keeping Land
 
01:00:05.809 --> 01:00:05.819 align:start position:0%
open for hunting is really important and
 
01:00:07.849 --> 01:00:07.859 align:start position:0%
I was concerned that
 
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
you know the game camera issue if we
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
didn't do something about it might
 
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
um end up just more and more owners
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
might just post their land and that that
 
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
to me would be a terrible outcome
 
01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
um so I understand the problem you're
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
identifying I'm not you know I don't
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
think it's unmanageable frankly under
 
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:00:32.809 --> 01:00:32.819 align:start position:0%
thank you um what are the posting
 
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:35.220 align:start position:0%
requirements for example no trespassing
 
01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:37.079 align:start position:0%
signs have to be I think one every 300
 
01:00:37.079 --> 01:00:37.970 align:start position:0%
signs have to be I think one every 300
feet

01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
feet
 
01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
is this going to have a minimum number
 
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
of signs or some property boundaries
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
could be three four five six eight miles
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
long how do you go about ensuring
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
posting requirements are met
 
01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind I'll let Colonel
 
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
Jordan talk talk through that okay
 
01:00:53.569 --> 01:00:53.579 align:start position:0%
perhaps it
 
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
anything else one more follow-up
 
01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
follow-up again
 
01:00:58.490 --> 01:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
um on a different topic regarding
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
labeling of the camera what is to
 
01:01:02.089 --> 01:01:02.099 align:start position:0%
prevent someone from putting Humphrey
 
01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
Bogart on the camera with the fictitious
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
phone number because anyone could put
 
01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:07.140 align:start position:0%
anything they want to satisfy the
 
01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:08.870 align:start position:0%
anything they want to satisfy the
requirements

01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um if people choose to
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
break the law they can find all kinds of
 
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:16.140 align:start position:0%
creative ways to do it but I kind of
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
know the Humphrey Bogart isn't doing
 
01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
much hunting anymore but I mean I don't
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
mean to be facetious I think that
 
01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:22.980 align:start position:0%
there's a if there's a if somebody has
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
falsified a record on that they are
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
potentially subject for a violation and
 
01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
I suspect Fish and Game officers might
 
01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:35.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:38.809 --> 01:01:38.819 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative Ming
 
01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
um thank you Senator waters for taking
 
01:01:48.049 --> 01:01:48.059 align:start position:0%
my question uh the 24-hour waiting
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
period it says remote viewing does that
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
mean only game cameras that transmit
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
photos and videos or is that is it
 
01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
supposed to include a game camera that
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
you have to actually go
 
01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your question my
 
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
understanding of the technology is that
 
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh you're downloading it the images
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
so it is remote
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
you're receiving a remote I don't know
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I could understood the
 
01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:19.980 align:start position:0%
question but uh nope follow it follow up
 
01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
um so I have a game camera that doesn't
 
01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:26.819 align:start position:0%
transmit pictures I can pick it up and
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
view the pictures on the camera itself
 
01:02:30.119 --> 01:02:31.069 align:start position:0%
view the pictures on the camera itself
um

01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:31.079 --> 01:02:32.450 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:36.289 --> 01:02:36.299 align:start position:0%
it's I I wouldn't necessarily classify
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
that as
 
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
remote is is the intent that it should
 
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
all cameras all game cam all game
 
01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:48.299 align:start position:0%
cameras or is it
 
01:02:50.089 --> 01:02:50.099 align:start position:0%
are they the game cameras if you don't
 
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
mind if I step in uh Senator uh the the
 
01:02:55.849 --> 01:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
key word here is uh remotely viewing
 
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
okay here
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
um and we went through this with the
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
bill last year uh it's it does not
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
mean that the ones you have to go out
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
and take the camera card out or to view
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
it out on the camera itself has to have
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
that 24 hour period it's only when
 
01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
you've when you've viewed the image of
 
01:03:13.549 --> 01:03:13.559 align:start position:0%
the animal remotely and that's why it
 
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
says remotely viewing in there thank you
 
01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and I think you know that
 
01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
that's the way I I think that's what it
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
does say so I just checked to make sure
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
it had the word remotely viewing still
 
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
in it I was like well did that fall out
 
01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
somehow yeah and I think that if
 
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
somebody comes out and you know they're
 
01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
not getting them remotely they come out
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
and they look at them I don't think the
 
01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
24 I don't think the 24 hours
 
01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
the deer comes to see you yep undown on
 
01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
the camera they're gonna be pretty
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
scarce anyways okay is that it uh yeah
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you representative Ming
 
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions I will ask
 
01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
you one more on as I as I let you go
 
01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
have you thought about putting a
 
01:03:52.609 --> 01:03:52.619 align:start position:0%
companion bill in through criminal
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
justice because as I pointed out to uh
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
the Timberland Owners Association the
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
Farm Bureau and the Wildlife Federation
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of these cameras because
 
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
they've come down in price and they're
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
so available are being used uh by people
 
01:04:08.089 --> 01:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
who are not hunters and putting these
 
01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
regulations in the hunting codes does
 
01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
not provide for penalties for their
 
01:04:15.730 --> 01:04:15.740 align:start position:0%
misuse on the criminal side
 
01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:18.380 align:start position:0%
for somebody who say
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
is using it as a private detective to
 
01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
see if somebody is uh saying that
 
01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
they're disabled and taking work
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
workman's comp when they're not does not
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
prohibit the use by stalkers to stalk
 
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
somebody does not prohibit the use by
 
01:04:37.569 --> 01:04:37.579 align:start position:0%
wild wildlife viewers who aren't Hunters
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
so if I'm a bird watcher and I want to
 
01:04:42.289 --> 01:04:42.299 align:start position:0%
go out and put the cameras bird watching
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not hunting I don't have a hunter's
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
license I don't need a hunting license
 
01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
but uh and or if I'm just out there
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
looking for Sasquatch right these
 
01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
cameras are used for all kinds of
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
purposes and this putting it in the
 
01:04:59.329 --> 01:04:59.339 align:start position:0%
hunting regulations is only fixing a
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
part of the problem
 
01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
so uh if you have any interest uh we
 
01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
should talk on yeah putting a criminal
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
criminal side companion bill through
 
01:05:12.289 --> 01:05:12.299 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks and um you know let's let's
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
think about that for next year there's
 
01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
some things to check because we we have
 
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:18.299 align:start position:0%
done some legislation on drones and
 
01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
other kinds of forms there is indeed and
 
01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
Neil Kirk is here today yeah and I mean
 
01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
I actually worked on many years ago when
 
01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
I put in some drone legislation which we
 
01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
passed um
 
01:05:30.049 --> 01:05:30.059 align:start position:0%
worked with what trail cameras are not
 
01:05:31.849 --> 01:05:31.859 align:start position:0%
drones yeah no I know I know but I'm
 
01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
just saying I I think I I'd like to
 
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
check and see just where we're at now in
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
statute absolutely and if we're not
 
01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
covered I you know I think that that's
 
01:05:42.049 --> 01:05:42.059 align:start position:0%
something that probably does need to be
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
this in this in this times aren't they
 
01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:48.299 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you thank you
 
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:53.329 --> 01:05:53.339 align:start position:0%
the chair will now call uh Robert
 
01:05:55.970 --> 01:05:55.980 align:start position:0%
Johnson II who's in support of the bill
 
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
and has asked for three to four minutes
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna try to hold everybody to their
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
time if you don't mind
 
01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:06.059 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Rob Johnson
 
01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire Farm
 
01:06:09.289 --> 01:06:09.299 align:start position:0%
Bureau as a federation's policy director
 
01:06:11.089 --> 01:06:11.099 align:start position:0%
and I do have written testimony that I
 
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
can provide to the committee but this
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
issue came about originally at least on
 
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
our side of the things was when House
 
01:06:20.329 --> 01:06:20.339 align:start position:0%
Bill 490 was introduced last session and
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
that was relative to the use of
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
live-action game cameras which for those
 
01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
of you that aren't aware
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
um the question was asked earlier about
 
01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
that the 24 hours and fish and game
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
rules in within the rules it prohibits
 
01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
the use of using that image within a
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
24-hour period I mean it's in rules not
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
in law and that's what this partially
 
01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
does but it came about with the use of
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
the live action was was we didn't take a
 
01:06:45.049 --> 01:06:45.059 align:start position:0%
position on that portion of the bill
 
01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
that we it was we had landowners that
 
01:06:49.809 --> 01:06:49.819 align:start position:0%
were surprised to learn
 
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
as I was in much of our leadership that
 
01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
you did not need landowner permission to
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
place a a camera on private property so
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
at that hearing we requested this
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
potentially this requirement in in our
 
01:07:08.329 --> 01:07:08.339 align:start position:0%
initial uh the information we provided
 
01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
the committee was based on information
 
01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
from a law in the state of Maine that
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
that requires land on permission as to
 
01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
other states Wisconsin being another
 
01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:19.130 align:start position:0%
other states Wisconsin being another
um

01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:19.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
I guess the one thing we'd like like you
 
01:07:22.609 --> 01:07:22.619 align:start position:0%
to know and what we've worked on this
 
01:07:24.529 --> 01:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
this language where the Timberland
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
owners has been stated earlier with with
 
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Federation and with fish and
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
game but we would like to make the
 
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
committee clear that uh you know we're
 
01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
an organization that is uh includes many
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
devoted Hunters made up of people that
 
01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:43.140 align:start position:0%
hunt and we strongly support we will
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
title is to defend the states long time
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
tradition of public access to private
 
01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:50.780 align:start position:0%
land our members many are proud to to
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
have our lands used for recreational
 
01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.470 align:start position:0%
have our lands used for recreational
purposes

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.990 align:start position:0%
purposes
uh

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
we just believe that it is a courtesy
 
01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
and a landowner should have the right to
 
01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
say no
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh if uh if somebody were to post a
 
01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
camera more more often than not a
 
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
landowner is going to just want to know
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
that the cameras are there who put them
 
01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:15.059 align:start position:0%
up where they are they may want to say
 
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
no I'm not over here but over here they
 
01:08:18.289 --> 01:08:18.299 align:start position:0%
may want them taken down at a certain
 
01:08:21.709 --> 01:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
time but uh you know in effect and I say
 
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
it in my letter that that a a camera
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
posted on private property without me as
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
a lender or knowing who put it up or
 
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
where it is it's a surveillance device
 
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll leave it at that Mr chair
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time thank you
 
01:08:40.729 --> 01:08:40.739 align:start position:0%
thank you were there any questions
 
01:08:44.209 --> 01:08:44.219 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:47.699 align:start position:0%
I will now call Diane Richardson uh who
 
01:08:50.329 --> 01:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
opposes the bill and has asked for five
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
minutes and does have written testimony
 
01:08:54.349 --> 01:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
oh and Sir if you want to hand your
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
testimony down uh to representative Ming
 
01:08:58.130 --> 01:08:58.140 align:start position:0%
he'll make sure we all get a copy of it
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
and just for anybody who else who has
 
01:09:03.169 --> 01:09:03.179 align:start position:0%
any uh we'll just follow the protocol of
 
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
putting it on the table here by
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
representative Ming and then he'll take
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
and make sure we all get a copy thank
 
01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:14.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Diane Richardson I live in
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
the Lake Sunapee region I'm here to
 
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
testify against SB 14 as it's currently
 
01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:23.209 align:start position:0%
testify against SB 14 as it's currently
written

01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
I want to start by saying I absolutely
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
understand why this bill has come about
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
I know about several of the incidences
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
landowners have complained about and I
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
completely agree that no landowner
 
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
should be afraid to use their land for
 
01:09:39.289 --> 01:09:39.299 align:start position:0%
fear being surveilled I also agree that
 
01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
currently landowners do not have any way
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
of knowing if the cameras are owned by
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
hunters nature Watchers or criminals
 
01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
while hunters and nature Watchers do not
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
want to get any humans on camera the
 
01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
landowners don't always understand that
 
01:09:57.290 --> 01:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
however I also believe
 
01:09:59.870 --> 01:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
that this bill as written has several
 
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
potential problems and I'd really like
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
to see those results so we can reach an
 
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
agreeable compromise
 
01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
this bill would require the labeling of
 
01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
all cameras with the name and contact
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
information and as
 
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned that that could
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
allow the doxing and harassment of
 
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
Hunters by anti-hunters animal rights
 
01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
activists and also the targeting of
 
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
Hunters by others who might have some
 
01:10:24.610 --> 01:10:24.620 align:start position:0%
sort of a beef with somebody
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
this would increase property theft
 
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
vandalism as well as increase the odds
 
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
of a conflict in and out of the woods
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
a name on a camera could be potentially
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
dangerous a telephone number though oh
 
01:10:39.490 --> 01:10:39.500 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm all for that
 
01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
would change cell camera hunting
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
prohibition from the current same
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
calendar day to within 24 hours
 
01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
this will effectively eliminate all
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
hunting in the areas with cell cameras
 
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
unless the hunter turns off transmission
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
more than 24 hours before hunting the
 
01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:58.189 align:start position:0%
more than 24 hours before hunting the
area

01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:11:00.169 --> 01:11:00.179 align:start position:0%
and will increase the enforcement
 
01:11:00.179 --> 01:11:03.590 align:start position:0%
and will increase the enforcement
difficulty

01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:05.689 --> 01:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
it would require written permission for
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
the placement of any camera cell or
 
01:11:10.189 --> 01:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
non-cell on any private land including
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
current use recreational
 
01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
the exception listed is state-owned or
 
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
managed land
 
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
town or county-owned lands are not
 
01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
listed as an exemption exception they
 
01:11:25.010 --> 01:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
are not privately owned and they should
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
be accepted Exempted
 
01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
current use recreational land tax
 
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:33.480 align:start position:0%

hunting fishing or nature observation
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
cameras absolutely fit nature
 
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.729 align:start position:0%
cameras absolutely fit nature

01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:40.739 align:start position:0%
observation
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that are not even
 
01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
Hunters utilize game cameras there's an
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
entire social media groups dedicated to
 
01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
such non-hunter game camera nature
 
01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:49.910 align:start position:0%
such non-hunter game camera nature
photos

01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
photos
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
game cameras are definitely I'd argue

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
must allow all of the following

approval of local assistance officials
 
01:12:53.149 --> 01:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
end quote
 
01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
additionally this law change will result
 
01:12:57.169 --> 01:12:57.179 align:start position:0%
in much more land being posted
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%

Hampshire
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
because landowners will get very tired
 
01:13:03.530 --> 01:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
of being asked permission and will just
 
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
post the land to stop the phone calls
 
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
and door knocking
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
Southeast New Hampshire has literally
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
hundreds of cameras out there that would
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
now need permission slips
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
my ideas for compromise are all cameras
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
labeled clearly with a valid working
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
telephone number only
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%

alternatively simply ban cell cameras

and current use Tech recreational tax
 
01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:07.620 align:start position:0%

01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
for those that would put it on the
 
01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
hunter or the nature Watcher to go to
 
01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
the town clerk and confirm current use

01:14:25.490 --> 01:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there

the chair will put on his glasses and
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
call Dennis Ward who is supporting the
 
01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
bill and needs five minutes
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
if you can keep it to your time or
 
01:14:49.370 --> 01:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
slightly less that'd be appreciated
 
01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me I probably won't
 
01:14:56.689 --> 01:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
need five minutes I I just overstate
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
just in case uh for the record I am
 
01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
Dennis Ward I'm a retired Dairy Farmer
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
from up in Northern New Hampshire Monroe
 
01:15:06.729 --> 01:15:06.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire actually
 
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
I own some parcels of land that Hunters
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
hunt on my Farm's been in my family for
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
more than 200 years and and uh
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
um to be honest I I have really good
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
rapport with all the hunters up there
 
01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
that hunt my property uh some of them
 
01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
and probably most of them come to me and
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
say I'm going to hunt on your land do
 
01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
you mind and I totally appreciate it uh
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
my wife my family and I and and my
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
brothers sisters all of us walked the
 
01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
woods on my property on property they
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
all own
 
01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
um quite a bit one weekend we're getting
 
01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
a little older so we don't so much
 
01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
anymore but but I would be very
 
01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
distressed if I got up there and found
 
01:15:57.169 --> 01:15:57.179 align:start position:0%
game cameras uh that I didn't know were
 
01:16:00.669 --> 01:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
there I have never posted my property
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
because the hunters have been good they
 
01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
come ask me or or I've had Hunters say I
 
01:16:09.649 --> 01:16:09.659 align:start position:0%
got a deer up on yours you want to slice
 
01:16:12.649 --> 01:16:12.659 align:start position:0%
of meat or something and and uh
 
01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to have people out there we
 
01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
have a lot that's almost 100 acres and
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
and we went to the school and said use
 
01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
it for your kids they've taken the
 
01:16:25.689 --> 01:16:25.699 align:start position:0%
students up there they've built a
 
01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
three-sided shelter
 
01:16:30.290 --> 01:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
um out of trees from up there that they
 
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
cut they do outdoor classes up there
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
they even have had some of their classes
 
01:16:38.050 --> 01:16:38.060 align:start position:0%
go up on a weekend and stay overnight
 
01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
we're happy to have people use it but
 
01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:43.490 align:start position:0%
we're happy to have people use it but
um

01:16:43.490 --> 01:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
my mindset and and it's similar to those
 
01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
that I talk to is that this is my
 
01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
property I I do the upkeep on it I log
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
it as uh conservatively and as
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
conscious of the environment as I can
 
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
I think if somebody wants to use the
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
property that I'm caring for they should
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
let me know and I've had people say to
 
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
me they were surprised that it wasn't
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
already a law that they had to get
 
01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
permission to put something like game
 
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
cameras up there it's the same with the
 
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
tree stands people whether they injure a
 
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
tree or not people think that they ought
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
to asked the owner first
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
but anyway I support this most of the
 
01:17:35.209 --> 01:17:35.219 align:start position:0%
people the landowners that I talk to up
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
in Northern New Hampshire support this
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
um so appreciate your no I I would like
 
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
to talk to one point there's some been
 
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:45.300 align:start position:0%
some suggestions of changes I don't
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
think you can make this perfect
 
01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
you can have 18 pages of legislation to
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
get all of the details that might be
 
01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
missed but I think we have to trust and
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
understand that that you need to get the
 
01:18:04.729 --> 01:18:04.739 align:start position:0%
basic concept down and and I think fish
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
and game is is been very good they've
 
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
um I don't remember if it was fish and
 
01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
game or the police department but one or
 
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
the other has been to me and said hey
 
01:18:16.669 --> 01:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to do something involves
 
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
your property and I don't remember what
 
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
it was for now but but fish and game is
 
01:18:24.410 --> 01:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
very good at unless they have to keep it
 
01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
secret they talk to the landowners and
 
01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
and let them know what they're doing so
 
01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
that's not an issue as far as I'm
 
01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
concerned but anyway thank you thank you
 
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
for your testimony are there any
 
01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:37.070 align:start position:0%
for your testimony are there any
questions

01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question based on your
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
testimony it sounds like you have a
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
great working relationship with the
 
01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:47.699 align:start position:0%
hunters that come to your land is that
 
01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
correct I do yes so then if you have
 
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
this great relationship now how is this
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:56.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:59.390 align:start position:0%
um
well

01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
I'm a bit conservative and I watch
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
what's happening in government
 
01:19:06.649 --> 01:19:06.659 align:start position:0%
Nationwide not as much in New Hampshire
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
but Nationwide and some in New Hampshire
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
and there's so much creep into the
 
01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
rights of of property owners I'm
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about it you you allow Hunters
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
without getting permission now
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
even nature people that are looking at
 
01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
nature this is fine it's not a big deal
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
but when does it move to uh somebody
 
01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
spying on me or trying to find out what
 
01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
I'm doing that I shouldn't be doing or
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
whatever I you know I just I think it's
 
01:19:38.209 --> 01:19:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any further
 
01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:41.990 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any further
questions

01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
01:19:47.689 --> 01:19:47.699 align:start position:0%
the chair now recognizes and calls Neil
 
01:19:47.699 --> 01:19:49.070 align:start position:0%
the chair now recognizes and calls Neil
Kirk

01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
Kirk
 
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
supports the bill and asks for two
 
01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:52.790 align:start position:0%
supports the bill and asks for two
minutes

01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record I'm
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
Neil Kirk I live in Ware and I'm
 
01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
this bill is very important because of
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
its privacy aspect
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why folks keep their
 
01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:09.260 align:start position:0%
land open and don't post it is because
 
01:20:12.410 --> 01:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
they have no problem with Hunters bird
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
watchers and everyone else coming on
 
01:20:16.010 --> 01:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
their land and doing things
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
if you change that
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
accuse me if technology changes that
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
and so without further legislation
 
01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
anyone coming on my property or a
 
01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
property can put up a camera and see
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
what I'm doing with my wife or whatever
 
01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
I happen to be doing with my friends and
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
Neighbors when we walk the property
 
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have an adverse reaction to
 
01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:42.590 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have an adverse reaction to
that

01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.570 --> 01:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
I don't want what I'm doing to be
 
01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
available for some public sitting in the
 
01:20:49.330 --> 01:20:49.340 align:start position:0%
in a bar somewhere watching it
 
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
it's just not the kind of thing that I
 
01:20:57.649 --> 01:20:57.659 align:start position:0%
expected so
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take Ria I'm going to react
 
01:21:02.030 --> 01:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
to that retroactively you're changing
 
01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
the rules so I'm going to take my land
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
out of conservation status I'm not going
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
to put my land into conservation status
 
01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
I'm going to post my land
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
you will find that the available land
 
01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
for hunting and bird watching decreases
 
01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
immediately by those people who are
 
01:21:22.030 --> 01:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
upset that retroactively after they've
 
01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
done expecting done put their land into
 
01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
conservation expecting certain things
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
find out that's not the case technology
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
has changed the way we do things and the
 
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
legislature is an obligation to make
 
01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:33.890 align:start position:0%
legislature is an obligation to make
sure

01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
that we protect those people who have
 
01:21:37.850 --> 01:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
expectations of privacy on their own
 
01:21:40.010 --> 01:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
property even when they open it up to
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
others not expecting to be spied on
 
01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know how you deal with some of
 
01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
the other issues in this bill it's not
 
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
it's not my area of expertise but I
 
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
think the chairman was right when he
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
suggested before that not only should
 
01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
this issue cover Hunters but it should
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
cover other people accessing that
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
property who are not Hunters
 
01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
to protect the privacy of the landowner
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
now some landowners may not care and
 
01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
but the point is that you give people
 
01:22:11.570 --> 01:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
the option to say yes I accept these
 
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
cameras on my property or I don't and
 
01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
not be surprised when they're out with
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
their honey necking in the woods so to
 
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
speak finding their own candid camera
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
and everybody in the local bar room is
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
laughing at them
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
this is a very important bill from a
 
01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
privacy point of view and I hope you
 
01:22:27.649 --> 01:22:27.659 align:start position:0%
folks will do the right thing thank you
 
01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
thank you rep former representative and
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Neil Kirk it's good to see
 
01:22:34.729 --> 01:22:34.739 align:start position:0%
you again and it's good to hear that
 
01:22:35.930 --> 01:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
you're still out necking in the woods
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
with your wife
 
01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that she'll appreciate the
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
fact I've made that public but
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
nonetheless yes
 
01:22:45.709 --> 01:22:45.719 align:start position:0%
representative Smith you're recognized
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm just going off
 
01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
quick my own personal memory
 
01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
um game cameras have been around
 
01:22:56.810 --> 01:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
probably 30 years with film meaning I
 
01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
remember back in the day I would have to
 
01:22:59.630 --> 01:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
go in swap the film out and get it
 
01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
developed to get pictures digital
 
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
cameras probably been around about 20
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
years where you just take the SD card
 
01:23:06.770 --> 01:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
out live action cameras I think have
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
been around maybe 10 years
 
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
so this technology in many forms has
 
01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
been around for almost 30 years and it
 
01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
has transformed to what we see today
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
with these live action cameras but the
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
point is what has changed over the last
 
01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
10 years that these cameras have been
 
01:23:25.370 --> 01:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
around the live action ones and today
 
01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question very simply
 
01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
the price has gone down and everybody
 
01:23:31.729 --> 01:23:31.739 align:start position:0%
can have these simple as that the fact
 
01:23:33.770 --> 01:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
that technology is very expensive means
 
01:23:35.630 --> 01:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
that it's not readily available when it
 
01:23:37.070 --> 01:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
becomes cheap it's readily available
 
01:23:39.410 --> 01:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
everybody uses it and that's the reason
 
01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
thank you and get a representative Brown
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you explain for
 
01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:54.140 align:start position:0%
me a little bit what you mean by uh
 
01:23:57.250 --> 01:23:57.260 align:start position:0%
retroactively that this this changes
 
01:23:59.570 --> 01:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
retroactively the way the law was can
 
01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
you just clarify for me thank you I
 
01:24:03.410 --> 01:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
probably I shouldn't have used the word
 
01:24:06.169 --> 01:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
changes the law retroactively but it
 
01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:13.610 --> 01:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
honorable Kirk welcome good to see you
 
01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:21.950 align:start position:0%
honorable Kirk welcome good to see you
sir

01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
undercurrent use currently allows folks
 
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
to have access to land open access to
 
01:24:28.679 --> 01:24:29.750 align:start position:0%
to have access to land open access to
land

01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
land
 
01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
do you believe that under those current
 
01:24:35.689 --> 01:24:35.699 align:start position:0%
use laws and having the ability to have
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
open access to land gives you a right
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
to surveil that property of another
 
01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.790 align:start position:0%
to surveil that property of another
individual

01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
personally no and I think that's the
 
01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
issue before the uh the house with this
 
01:24:50.810 --> 01:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:51.709 align:start position:0%
particular bill
um

01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:51.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
especially in New Hampshire where we're
 
01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
pretty individualistic and protect our
 
01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
own privacy rights look at that recent
 
01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment that passed
 
01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
with 81 percent of the vote
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
um we expect certain things and when
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
those expectations don't come about
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
we react
 
01:25:13.370 --> 01:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
and one of the things we expect is that
 
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
when we open our property to others
 
01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to go there look at it
 
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
ride horses whatever they're going to do
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
but they're not going to do the kinds of
 
01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
things we don't expect them to do and
 
01:25:24.770 --> 01:25:24.780 align:start position:0%
that includes surveillance unintentional
 
01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
or intentional we just don't expect that
 
01:25:29.630 --> 01:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
and I think to the extent that that is
 
01:25:31.570 --> 01:25:31.580 align:start position:0%
now possible and apparently legal
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
possible in terms of economics legal in
 
01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
terms of the fact that apparently it's
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
not prohibited by law I think folks in
 
01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire look to the legislature to
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
protect them to to resolve that issue
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:48.649 --> 01:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
 
01:25:51.169 --> 01:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:25:52.970 --> 01:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr
 
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you again for my uh
 
01:25:56.090 --> 01:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:25:58.729 --> 01:25:58.739 align:start position:0%
in an open public area there is no
 
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy that's that's
 
01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
fact that's law meaning you're walking
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
through the woods you're in a parking
 
01:26:05.689 --> 01:26:05.699 align:start position:0%
lot you're in a public space here
 
01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
there's no expectation of privacy so I
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
hear this talk about privacy privacy
 
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
privacy these game cameras are invading
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
privacy but in reality they're in open
 
01:26:17.149 --> 01:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
space they're in an area where if I want
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
to go with my telephoto camera take
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
pictures I'm free to do so I don't see
 
01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
the difference here
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
between open space whether it's a live
 
01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
action camera or someone with a cell
 
01:26:29.209 --> 01:26:29.219 align:start position:0%
phone camera
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question I I do see a
 
01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
distinction the kinds of spaces that
 
01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
you're talking about are so-called quote
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
public spaces unquote the street
 
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
the public Courthouse
 
01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is private
 
01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:44.450 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is private
property

01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
and I think the expectations of privacy
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
are very different for that even where
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
private property is by the landowners
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
action or inaction open to the public I
 
01:26:56.330 --> 01:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
see a very great distinction between
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you Mr
 
01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you members of the
 
01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:07.430 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you members of the
committee

01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:14.090 align:start position:0%
 
Nick

01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
Nick
 
01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:16.430 align:start position:0%
Nick
Spader

01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
Spader
 
01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:19.610 align:start position:0%
Spader
okay

01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
so my name is Nick spadero I live in
 
01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
Ware uh thank you for taking my
 
01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:29.750 align:start position:0%
Ware uh thank you for taking my
statement

01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
I see a couple of additional issues with
 
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:27:36.530 --> 01:27:36.540 align:start position:0%
um ones that Diane uh didn't mention she
 
01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
did a good job of listing a lot of them
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
my first one is that no one mentioned
 
01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
what the fee is if you are caught with a
 
01:27:45.890 --> 01:27:45.900 align:start position:0%
game camera and the fee as listed in the
 
01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
bill is a thousand dollars per offense
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
and to me that's pretty harsh if this
 
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
bill passes it goes into effect 60 days
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
after it passes and so some people like
 
01:28:00.169 --> 01:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
me have dozens of cameras out in the
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
woods and I'm gonna have to do a Mad
 
01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
Dash to try to remember and find every
 
01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
single one of them and if I miss a
 
01:28:07.729 --> 01:28:07.739 align:start position:0%
couple and my name and phone number is
 
01:28:09.410 --> 01:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
already on my game camera I'm gonna get
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
a call from fish and game and I could be
 
01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
in for thousands of dollars and to me
 
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
when you can do a lot of things
 
01:28:17.689 --> 01:28:17.699 align:start position:0%
illegally in the woods
 
01:28:19.490 --> 01:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
um hunting things out of season poaching
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
the wrong gender of animal it this fee
 
01:28:23.689 --> 01:28:23.699 align:start position:0%
schedule just doesn't fit with
 
01:28:25.149 --> 01:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
01:28:28.490 --> 01:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago I shot a male turkey
 
01:28:30.410 --> 01:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
which is referred to as a Tom And
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
there's a female turkey in the grass
 
01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
next to him and I didn't see her in two
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
of my pellets from my shotgun struck her
 
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
in the head and unfortunately killed her
 
01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
so I called fish and game they came down
 
01:28:41.629 --> 01:28:41.639 align:start position:0%
and gave me a 200 fee and took the bird
 
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
and I thought 200 was a little excessive
 
01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:45.780 align:start position:0%
for my first offense and an honest
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
mistake and so to charge people a
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for a game camera when
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
people have dozens out there could be
 
01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
excessive in my opinion
 
01:28:57.890 --> 01:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
the other thing that's not mentioned and
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
I do sympathize with folks landowners
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
I'm a landowner myself that thought that
 
01:29:05.209 --> 01:29:05.219 align:start position:0%
this was already the law uh it makes
 
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
sense when you when you first hear it
 
01:29:08.930 --> 01:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
that it would be law but I'm going to
 
01:29:11.530 --> 01:29:11.540 align:start position:0%
list the states that do not require
 
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
permission to place a game camera on
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
private land Massachusetts does not
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
require Vermont does not require Rhode
 
01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:20.639 align:start position:0%
Island does not require New Jersey does
 
01:29:22.850 --> 01:29:22.860 align:start position:0%
not require a New York does not require
 
01:29:25.729 --> 01:29:25.739 align:start position:0%
it Connecticut does not require it so I
 
01:29:27.410 --> 01:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
don't think that the great state of New
 
01:29:30.169 --> 01:29:30.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be in a club with all
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
those other states and have more
 
01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
restrictive game camera access than
 
01:29:35.629 --> 01:29:35.639 align:start position:0%
States like New York Massachusetts
 
01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:48.590 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
today

01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
chair now calls Chris Fife
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
who's asked for three to five minutes
 
01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:54.900 align:start position:0%
and supports the bill and does have
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
written testimony so if you could just
 
01:29:58.370 --> 01:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
leave that over there for representative
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
Ming that would be fantastic and thank
 
01:30:03.290 --> 01:30:03.300 align:start position:0%

01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:14.689 align:start position:0%
you representative Ming for taking the
handouts

01:30:14.689 --> 01:30:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:17.820 align:start position:0%

uh I have much of what I'm going to say
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
in the written comments that I'm passing
 
01:30:42.290 --> 01:30:42.300 align:start position:0%
around uh those apply to both SB 14 and
 
01:30:45.169 --> 01:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
15 so I will just focus on SB 14 right
 
01:30:45.179 --> 01:30:45.950 align:start position:0%
15 so I will just focus on SB 14 right
now

01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:45.960 align:start position:0%

we recognize that New Hampshire has a

rich hunting tradition and Heritage
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's underpinned by Hunter's respect
 
01:31:28.129 --> 01:31:28.139 align:start position:0%
for private landowners who allow them to
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
access to conduct private property
 
01:31:32.689 --> 01:31:32.699 align:start position:0%
warehouser recognizes that this
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
tradition supports sound game management
 
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
as well as important recreational
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
economies in the small communities Where
 
01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
We own land
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
we welcome hunting and fishing and other
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
dispersed Recreation on our property and
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
strive to maintain a relationship of
 
01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
mutual respect with Hunters
 
01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
these users are often the first ones to
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
alert us if there are any issues out on
 
01:31:57.770 --> 01:31:57.780 align:start position:0%
the land and that's important to us they
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
act as another set of eyes when we don't
 
01:32:03.729 --> 01:32:03.739 align:start position:0%
have our own Foresters in an area
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
on a routine basis
 
01:32:07.199 --> 01:32:08.629 align:start position:0%
on a routine basis
foreign

01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
game cameras however aren't really an
 
01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
essential part of New Hampshire's
 
01:32:14.689 --> 01:32:14.699 align:start position:0%
hunting tradition in fact they're
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
relatively new technology that can
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
conduct surveillance of a landowner's
 
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
property without landowners knowledge
 
01:32:22.850 --> 01:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
I know we this was addressed to the
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
committee and I would agree with the uh
 
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
the comments that were made prior to my
 
01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
what I said about the technology and the
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
price of the technology recognizing that
 
01:32:34.129 --> 01:32:34.139 align:start position:0%
it has been out for a while but the the
 
01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
price is such now that really any hunter
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
can can get a hold of game camera and
 
01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
put those out
 
01:32:43.490 --> 01:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
landowners don't have any opportunity to
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
view the images or the data captured by
 
01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
the cameras and usually no knowledge of
 
01:32:50.209 --> 01:32:50.219 align:start position:0%
where the cameras are placed so sb14's
 
01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
requirement for permission to place the
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
game camera on private properties kind
 
01:32:57.649 --> 01:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
is a common sense step really respecting
 
01:32:59.570 --> 01:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
landowners rights while maintaining New
 
01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's hunting tradition
 
01:33:04.010 --> 01:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
when a hunter contacts us asking
 
01:33:06.110 --> 01:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
permission to place a game camera it
 
01:33:07.729 --> 01:33:07.739 align:start position:0%
provides an opportunity for us to ensure
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
that we do not have operational plans
 
01:33:12.169 --> 01:33:12.179 align:start position:0%
for that location this communication
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
helps us to avoid conflict and to
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
provide a safe experience for the hunter
 
01:33:19.729 --> 01:33:19.739 align:start position:0%
for loggers and for our Foresters
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
I know that I'm speaking for many of the
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
other large landowners and managers in
 
01:33:25.970 --> 01:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
Northern New Hampshire when I say that
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
sb14 will strengthen New Hampshire's
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
hunting tradition encouraging landowners
 
01:33:32.090 --> 01:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
to continue to generously share their
 
01:33:34.250 --> 01:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
land with recreational users a practice
 
01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
that benefits our local communities and
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:33:39.770 --> 01:33:39.780 align:start position:0%
so as a New Hampshire Timberland owner
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
warehouser respectfully urges the
 
01:33:44.689 --> 01:33:44.699 align:start position:0%
committee to pass SB 14 as presented
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
and if I could I would just like to say
 
01:33:48.370 --> 01:33:48.380 align:start position:0%
a couple of things
 
01:33:50.689 --> 01:33:50.699 align:start position:0%
just to make the point that this bill
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
this law would not only apply to Hunters
 
01:33:55.010 --> 01:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
as I understand it but to anybody who
 
01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
puts a game camera in the woods and I
 
01:34:00.530 --> 01:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
don't know if littering falls under fish
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
and game laws and I didn't have a chance
 
01:34:04.729 --> 01:34:04.739 align:start position:0%
to look at that but I will say that the
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
forest rangers and the wardens are
 
01:34:09.649 --> 01:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
always very helpful and responsive to
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
landowners to us as a landowner if we
 
01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
have issues with littering in helping us
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
figure that out so they act as
 
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
the uh they their law enforcement
 
01:34:23.110 --> 01:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
capabilities help us on issues Beyond
 
01:34:26.689 --> 01:34:26.699 align:start position:0%
just straight forestry issues or fish
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
and game issues and I so I think the
 
01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
game camera being put out whether it's
 
01:34:31.850 --> 01:34:31.860 align:start position:0%
put out by someone specifically for
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
hunting or for another purpose would
 
01:34:37.129 --> 01:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
still they would still be our go-to for
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
the first point of contact if we had a
 
01:34:40.729 --> 01:34:40.739 align:start position:0%
question about that
 
01:34:40.739 --> 01:34:43.070 align:start position:0%
question about that
uh

01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:46.010 --> 01:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
we also would be very interested in
 
01:34:49.610 --> 01:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
helping any hunter who was being
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
harassed in working with Fish and Game
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
to pursue whoever was doing the
 
01:34:59.209 --> 01:34:59.219 align:start position:0%
harassment uh in whatever method was
 
01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
necessary to to prevent that it's very
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
important to us that Hunters can still
 
01:35:07.970 --> 01:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
use our property that that tradition is
 
01:35:11.090 --> 01:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
upheld and you know we would see that as
 
01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
a real affront to that tradition and and
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
just frankly to common decency and
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
respect for hunters out on that property
 
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.270 align:start position:0%
respect for hunters out on that property
so

01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think the name and the the
 
01:35:23.930 --> 01:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
requirements of a name and a phone
 
01:35:27.050 --> 01:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
number should be a concern here and it
 
01:35:29.209 --> 01:35:29.219 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful to the landowner
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
in being able to communicate with the
 
01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
owner of the camera so I thank you for
 
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
your time and I'd be happy to answer any
 
01:35:39.410 --> 01:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
01:35:44.450 --> 01:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr
 
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
question I want to thank you for you
 
01:35:51.410 --> 01:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
wirehousers 24 000 acres and behalf of
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
the people keeping it open for hunting
 
01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
because that's an incredible amount of
 
01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.430 align:start position:0%
because that's an incredible amount of
land

01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
land
 
01:35:57.110 --> 01:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
um don't you think this will be a
 
01:35:59.090 --> 01:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
logistical nightmare for
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
owning so much land you theoretically
 
01:36:03.050 --> 01:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
could get bombarded with thousands of
 
01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
requests from hunters for permission to
 
01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
place cameras on your land how would you
 
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
go about implementing something such a
 
01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
great magnitude thank you for that
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
question yeah that's certainly something
 
01:36:18.169 --> 01:36:18.179 align:start position:0%
that when we first read this bill was
 
01:36:20.689 --> 01:36:20.699 align:start position:0%
one of our bigger questions and I think
 
01:36:22.729 --> 01:36:22.739 align:start position:0%
the provision in here to be able to post
 
01:36:27.410 --> 01:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
to allow cameras if that comes to be if
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
we find there's a huge number of
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
requests that would be an option we
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
could take my experience in working with
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
the land base in New Hampshire is that
 
01:36:39.770 --> 01:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
I would anticipate I would be surprised
 
01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
if there were more than a dozen or so
 
01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
requests for this
 
01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
so that's something we'll have to see as
 
01:36:49.610 --> 01:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
this plays out but I think the knowing
 
01:36:52.970 --> 01:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
whose camera it is that that is more
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
important to us at this point and and
 
01:36:58.810 --> 01:36:58.820 align:start position:0%
having people request permission then
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
the next step for us would be figuring
 
01:37:04.810 --> 01:37:04.820 align:start position:0%
out if we need to do go the posting
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative Brown
 
01:37:13.790 --> 01:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair uh and thank you
 
01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
taking my question you bring up an
 
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
interesting point and I'm mentioning
 
01:37:18.530 --> 01:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
this just so maybe we can when the
 
01:37:19.970 --> 01:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
colonel comes up we can talk about this
 
01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:22.310 align:start position:0%
colonel comes up we can talk about this
later

01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:25.490 --> 01:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh were you saying if I understood you
 
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
correctly because of the definition of
 
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
game camera as it's put in this law
 
01:37:32.450 --> 01:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
which has any device capable of
 
01:37:36.050 --> 01:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
that you would read that to say it
 
01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:39.410 align:start position:0%
that you would read that to say it
covers

01:37:39.410 --> 01:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
covers
 
01:37:42.169 --> 01:37:42.179 align:start position:0%
any situation where someone so the
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
fishing game this large efficient game
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
would then cover

anyone that puts a camera that fits this
 
01:37:50.159 --> 01:37:51.649 align:start position:0%
anyone that puts a camera that fits this
definition

01:37:51.649 --> 01:37:51.659 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:37:53.450 --> 01:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
regardless of why they're putting it out
 
01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
there I think I think that's what you
 
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
said if I if I even made that even
 
01:37:59.110 --> 01:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
partially clear I'm sorry
 
01:38:00.890 --> 01:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
maybe the current will kind of address
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
that later but thank you yeah that's a
 
01:38:04.910 --> 01:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
good point I think
 
01:38:07.850 --> 01:38:07.860 align:start position:0%
I think I probably was not clear in in
 
01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
stating that either because I'm
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
certainly not an expert on that but I
 
01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
guess the point I will make is that fish
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
and game is often the one that we as a
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
landowner will go to first because they
 
01:38:21.890 --> 01:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
do represent they and the four strangers
 
01:38:24.050 --> 01:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
represent the law enforcement that deals
 
01:38:26.810 --> 01:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
with issues on Forest land especially in
 
01:38:30.530 --> 01:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
the North country and so uh I've I
 
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate you following up and I'll be
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
very interested to hear the Colonel's
 
01:38:36.890 --> 01:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
response to that as well
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:38:41.930 --> 01:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
the chair calls Walter Lacy uh so
 
01:38:47.810 --> 01:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
supports the bill and has asked for two
 
01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:53.450 align:start position:0%
supports the bill and has asked for two
minutes

01:38:53.450 --> 01:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
I've discovered a in a hearing issue and
 
01:38:58.970 --> 01:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
a setting like this and I
 
01:39:02.570 --> 01:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:05.930 --> 01:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
I am Walter Lacy from Keene and my wife
 
01:39:09.250 --> 01:39:09.260 align:start position:0%
and I own 650 acres of land in Keene
 
01:39:12.050 --> 01:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
Swansea and Chesterfield
 
01:39:14.209 --> 01:39:14.219 align:start position:0%
although not a hunter myself I believe
 
01:39:16.729 --> 01:39:16.739 align:start position:0%
very strongly in traditional uses of the
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
land and hunting is certainly one of
 
01:39:18.719 --> 01:39:19.729 align:start position:0%
land and hunting is certainly one of
them

01:39:19.729 --> 01:39:19.739 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
our land has always been open to hunting
 
01:39:24.290 --> 01:39:24.300 align:start position:0%
and trapping I can't imagine that
 
01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:25.610 align:start position:0%
and trapping I can't imagine that
changing

01:39:25.610 --> 01:39:25.620 align:start position:0%
changing
 
01:39:27.649 --> 01:39:27.659 align:start position:0%
that being said I have had a problem
 
01:39:30.010 --> 01:39:30.020 align:start position:0%
with tree stands over the years twice
 
01:39:33.169 --> 01:39:33.179 align:start position:0%
associated with game cameras in two
 
01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
instances healthy valuable oak trees are
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
damaged none of the stands or cameras
 
01:39:41.450 --> 01:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
had contact information on them and all
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
my efforts to communicate with the
 
01:39:45.770 --> 01:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
owners by leaving my contact information
 
01:39:47.570 --> 01:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
on flagging tape
 
01:39:49.970 --> 01:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
was unsuccessful
 
01:39:51.890 --> 01:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
in the most recent isn't it because of
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
the nature of the camera involved a fish
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
and game officer was able to identify
 
01:39:58.850 --> 01:39:58.860 align:start position:0%
the offender
 
01:40:00.770 --> 01:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
the mutual benefits of having contact
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
information on this equipment seem
 
01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:04.250 align:start position:0%
information on this equipment seem
undeniable

01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
undeniable
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
a simple phone call could clear up any
 
01:40:09.169 --> 01:40:09.179 align:start position:0%
question a landowner might have and a
 
01:40:11.450 --> 01:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
hunter might get back a misplaced stand
 
01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
or camera
 
01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
the increasing use and sophistication of
 
01:40:17.930 --> 01:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
game cameras should require permission
 
01:40:21.050 --> 01:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
for their use on private land
 
01:40:23.450 --> 01:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
the idea that something is allowed in my
 
01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:24.649 align:start position:0%
the idea that something is allowed in my
backyard

01:40:24.649 --> 01:40:24.659 align:start position:0%
backyard
 
01:40:28.010 --> 01:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
but not yours is unacceptable
 
01:40:30.530 --> 01:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
it all seems to me a matter of common
 
01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:32.570 align:start position:0%
it all seems to me a matter of common
courtesy

01:40:32.570 --> 01:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
courtesy
 
01:40:34.189 --> 01:40:34.199 align:start position:0%
if you want to leave a piece of gear on
 
01:40:35.689 --> 01:40:35.699 align:start position:0%
someone else's land
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
you get permission put your name on it
 
01:40:41.390 --> 01:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
what could be simple than that
 
01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
I don't like to see land posted I think
 
01:40:46.970 --> 01:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
it's a short-sighted measure
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
if the common sense requirements of
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
Senate bill is 14 and 15 are not enacted
 
01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:53.149 align:start position:0%
Senate bill is 14 and 15 are not enacted
however

01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:53.159 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid land owners may be left with
 
01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
no other choice
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
with privileges
 
01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:13.390 align:start position:0%
with privileges
comes

01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
I understand I think you hit the button
 
01:41:17.930 --> 01:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
for the mic with your hand when you were
 
01:41:20.930 --> 01:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
I got the impression that you were also
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
talking about the the next bill as well
 
01:41:27.169 --> 01:41:27.179 align:start position:0%
so uh if do you have written copies of
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
that I do yes okay if you could hand
 
01:41:30.590 --> 01:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
that down we will consider it for both
 
01:41:31.850 --> 01:41:31.860 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much for your time
 
01:41:34.609 --> 01:41:34.619 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much make
 
01:41:38.689 --> 01:41:38.699 align:start position:0%
sure you pass a copy down to or your
 
01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:47.090 --> 01:41:47.100 align:start position:0%
chair now calls
 
01:42:01.370 --> 01:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:02.990 --> 01:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:42:04.490 --> 01:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
Chuck Souther my wife Diane and I own a
 
01:42:10.250 --> 01:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
farm here in Concord
 
01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:11.090 align:start position:0%
farm here in Concord
um

01:42:11.090 --> 01:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:14.930 --> 01:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
I want to say that we love Hunters we
 
01:42:16.850 --> 01:42:16.860 align:start position:0%
have numerous Hunters that utilize the
 
01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
property we do ask however that they
 
01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:20.580 align:start position:0%
have permission
 
01:42:23.149 --> 01:42:23.159 align:start position:0%
and we do this because we are in a large
 
01:42:25.129 --> 01:42:25.139 align:start position:0%
part a pick your own Farm
 
01:42:27.530 --> 01:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
and open to the public we encourage our
 
01:42:30.649 --> 01:42:30.659 align:start position:0%
customers to not only do the pick your
 
01:42:33.290 --> 01:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
own thing but spend some time on the
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
farm bring a picnic lunch go down in the
 
01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
hay Fields walk through the woods on our
 
01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:39.229 align:start position:0%
hay Fields walk through the woods on our
trails

01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
trails
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
um so that that's all part of what we do
 
01:42:43.729 --> 01:42:43.739 align:start position:0%
and we think that they have a reasonable
 
01:42:45.169 --> 01:42:45.179 align:start position:0%
right to expect that they're not under
 
01:42:47.390 --> 01:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
surveillance doing that when we give
 
01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
permission to the hunters and when we
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons we do that is to make
 
01:42:52.669 --> 01:42:52.679 align:start position:0%
sure that the hunters we get permission
 
01:42:54.530 --> 01:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
to understand that there will be members
 
01:42:56.689 --> 01:42:56.699 align:start position:0%
of the public on those Trails
 
01:42:58.990 --> 01:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
specifically on weekends
 
01:43:01.970 --> 01:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
but also to find out a little bit more
 
01:43:03.290 --> 01:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
about what they're doing while they're
 
01:43:05.689 --> 01:43:05.699 align:start position:0%
out there the same goes for for tree
 
01:43:09.050 --> 01:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
stands when this all came up I was kind
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
of surprised as I think a lot of
 
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
landowners were to find out that we
 
01:43:13.609 --> 01:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
can't remove cameras that we don't know
 
01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
who put them there or why
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
um that just seems wrong to me you know
 
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
on my own property and what I kind of go
 
01:43:24.530 --> 01:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
back to when all this is when I was a
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
teenager and my father and uncles taught
 
01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
me how to hunt and when I took Hunter
 
01:43:32.090 --> 01:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
education which I'm thinking about it
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
here seeing was more than 50 years ago
 
01:43:36.530 --> 01:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
the thing that I remember the most was
 
01:43:38.050 --> 01:43:38.060 align:start position:0%
responsibility responsibility
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility for when you go on
 
01:43:41.689 --> 01:43:41.699 align:start position:0%
somebody else's property you're
 
01:43:43.129 --> 01:43:43.139 align:start position:0%
responsible for your actions you're
 
01:43:45.290 --> 01:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
responsible for your bullet responsible
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
for everything it just seems to me that
 
01:43:49.010 --> 01:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
that's what this really comes down to is
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
it not unreasonable to ask somebody
 
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
that's going to do something on your
 
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
property to ask permission
 
01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
that's just basic responsibility we went
 
01:43:59.390 --> 01:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
through this several years ago with the
 
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
arrow issue it's not doesn't seem to be
 
01:44:04.129 --> 01:44:04.139 align:start position:0%
a problem now to put names and addresses
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
on their arrows so that we don't find
 
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
them in our hay and my Dairy farming
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
friends don't find it in their silage so
 
01:44:13.189 --> 01:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
that's what this kind of came down to I
 
01:44:15.770 --> 01:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
support the bill and I hope that you can
 
01:44:18.890 --> 01:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
pass it thank you thank you sir are
 
01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
there any questions
 
01:44:22.669 --> 01:44:22.679 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
today you have written testimony please
 
01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:26.820 align:start position:0%
pass it to representative Ming if there
 
01:44:28.490 --> 01:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
aren't enough copies the clerk will make
 
01:44:31.129 --> 01:44:31.139 align:start position:0%
copies for the committee
 
01:44:33.290 --> 01:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
the chair calls Stephen wood who
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
supports the bill and has asked for
 
01:44:36.530 --> 01:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
three minutes
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:52.450 --> 01:44:52.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:54.830 --> 01:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
01:44:57.770 --> 01:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
to you I am Stephen wood uh I and my
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
family own about 900 and some odd acres
 
01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
in Lebanon in Plainfield and we manage
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
poverty Lane Orchards and Farnam
 
01:45:08.209 --> 01:45:08.219 align:start position:0%
hillsiders there
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
um and we post our land and I have just
 
01:45:13.970 --> 01:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
handed around uh signs of our of our
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
about copies of our signs we we welcome
 
01:45:20.209 --> 01:45:20.219 align:start position:0%
hunters and always have
 
01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
but we want them to show us the respect
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
of asking permission pretty
 
01:45:26.629 --> 01:45:26.639 align:start position:0%
straightforward we have had a wonderful
 
01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
relationship with Hunters therefore
 
01:45:31.010 --> 01:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
um and I suppose I could have brought
 
01:45:32.810 --> 01:45:32.820 align:start position:0%
you great big stacks of the permissions
 
01:45:35.390 --> 01:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
that we've handed out but
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
um we always have a lot of hunters on
 
01:45:39.169 --> 01:45:39.179 align:start position:0%
the land
 
01:45:41.390 --> 01:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
we also sometimes have to close part of
 
01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
our land because we like Chuck Souther
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
have a pick your own Orchard we have
 
01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
walked through the woods this year we
 
01:45:47.689 --> 01:45:47.699 align:start position:0%
closed a couple hundred acres until
 
01:45:47.699 --> 01:45:49.010 align:start position:0%
closed a couple hundred acres until
Thanksgiving

01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving
 
01:45:52.250 --> 01:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
not a single Hunter complaint even
 
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
people were accustomed to hunt there
 
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
they had another several hundred acres
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
of land to hold on and they where they
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
knew they were welcome
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
um but also the one of the good things
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
about these this relationship is they
 
01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
will encourage other Hunters to ask
 
01:46:10.669 --> 01:46:10.679 align:start position:0%
permission it seems to me New Hampshire
 
01:46:13.970 --> 01:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
has a long history of of supporting the
 
01:46:15.770 --> 01:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
writers rights of hunters which we
 
01:46:17.209 --> 01:46:17.219 align:start position:0%
support as well
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
but also of profound respect for private
 
01:46:23.209 --> 01:46:23.219 align:start position:0%
property and for personal
 
01:46:23.219 --> 01:46:25.129 align:start position:0%
property and for personal
privacy

01:46:25.129 --> 01:46:25.139 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
01:46:27.229 --> 01:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
this bill is about all of those things
 
01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
and it's also Chuck Souther was speaking
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
of respect it's about that and common
 
01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
courtesy civility
 
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
we own this land we pay taxes on this
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
land we care for this land
 
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
and it is not very difficult to ask us
 
01:46:48.890 --> 01:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
permission it's very rare for us to deny
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
permission there has to be something
 
01:46:54.050 --> 01:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
pretty egregious for for us to say no
 
01:46:56.209 --> 01:46:56.219 align:start position:0%
um but we also find that as I say the
 
01:46:57.950 --> 01:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
hunters we don't police Our Land The
 
01:46:59.930 --> 01:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
Hunters police the land the hunters tell
 
01:47:01.609 --> 01:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
us where there are stands that that that
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
don't have names on them how to sell us
 
01:47:05.689 --> 01:47:05.699 align:start position:0%
that there are people parking where they
 
01:47:08.689 --> 01:47:08.699 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be parking and you know yes
 
01:47:11.090 --> 01:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
those very welcoming signs we've passed
 
01:47:13.970 --> 01:47:13.980 align:start position:0%
around uh which basically say you're
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
welcome to use this land just please ask
 
01:47:18.410 --> 01:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
permission for a few things
 
01:47:20.450 --> 01:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
some of them wind up on the ground with
 
01:47:23.450 --> 01:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
bullets in them you know or Tires over
 
01:47:26.450 --> 01:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
them the hunters usually put them back
 
01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:28.010 align:start position:0%
them the hunters usually put them back
up

01:47:28.010 --> 01:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:47:29.810 --> 01:47:29.820 align:start position:0%
because we have developed this respect
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
for relationship but it is founded in
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
part on the courtesy of them respecting
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
our private property rights and asking
 
01:47:41.209 --> 01:47:41.219 align:start position:0%
permission this bill seems to be an
 
01:47:43.729 --> 01:47:43.739 align:start position:0%
absolutely sensible extension of that in
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
the modern world
 
01:47:50.209 --> 01:47:50.219 align:start position:0%
um and if we start finding that we
 
01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
can't insist on that
 
01:47:55.370 --> 01:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
we'll have one alternative which is to
 
01:47:57.290 --> 01:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
take those very friendly yellow signs
 
01:47:57.300 --> 01:47:58.870 align:start position:0%
take those very friendly yellow signs
down

01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:48:02.090 --> 01:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
make a phone call and order hundreds of
 
01:48:04.490 --> 01:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
bright red no trespassing signs that's
 
01:48:06.290 --> 01:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
about the last thing we want to do and
 
01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%
the people who've said if if you don't
 
01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
move forward with this sort of
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
legislation you're going to see more
 
01:48:15.229 --> 01:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
land posted to all of our detriment I
 
01:48:16.250 --> 01:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
think are right
 
01:48:19.729 --> 01:48:19.739 align:start position:0%
so I vigorously urge you to support this
 
01:48:19.739 --> 01:48:20.990 align:start position:0%
so I vigorously urge you to support this
bill

01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:48:23.570 --> 01:48:23.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for for your patience and
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
attention thank you sir
 
01:48:27.229 --> 01:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
there any questions
 
01:48:28.850 --> 01:48:28.860 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr
 
01:48:30.169 --> 01:48:30.179 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
question it appears you have an
 
01:48:34.990 --> 01:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
incredible system there of Hunter access
 
01:48:38.689 --> 01:48:38.699 align:start position:0%
a good system of cooperation no problems
 
01:48:41.870 --> 01:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh according to your testimony so why
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
would a bill like this be needed based
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
upon the system that you have that's in
 
01:48:47.090 --> 01:48:47.100 align:start position:0%
place that seems to work so well a bill
 
01:48:48.890 --> 01:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
like this is needed sir because of what
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
others have said which is that which is
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
that the people people don't know how to
 
01:48:56.689 --> 01:48:56.699 align:start position:0%
act and this stuff is very well
 
01:48:58.910 --> 01:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
available to all sorts of people
 
01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
I just I I want to make sure people know
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to spend the money to go
 
01:49:09.649 --> 01:49:09.659 align:start position:0%
put something like game cameras uh take
 
01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
our signs down and add a line about game
 
01:49:14.930 --> 01:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
cameras I want to just be able to rely
 
01:49:17.810 --> 01:49:17.820 align:start position:0%
on people asking permission and getting
 
01:49:21.129 --> 01:49:21.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:24.290 --> 01:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
this law would
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
I agree if you're implying that it's a
 
01:49:30.290 --> 01:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
Pity that we were we need this sort of
 
01:49:32.750 --> 01:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
clarity in law now but I'm afraid I
 
01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
think we do need this sort of clarity
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
alone now so it's not going to improve
 
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
on our circumstance with Hunters it's
 
01:49:40.970 --> 01:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
doing just going to further clarify the
 
01:49:42.590 --> 01:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
circumstance the deal
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
and it's not a system it's just our
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
communicating with with the people who
 
01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
are welcome to use our land what our
 
01:49:52.010 --> 01:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
expectations are and they're behaving
 
01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
accordingly I mean I guess that's a
 
01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
system I don't know I don't think I
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
don't think this is a systems engineer I
 
01:50:00.410 --> 01:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
just made a welcoming sign quite a lot
 
01:50:03.070 --> 01:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
we've had those signs up for
 
01:50:07.490 --> 01:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
25 years or something so
 
01:50:10.669 --> 01:50:10.679 align:start position:0%
thank you sir representative goalie
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for coming
 
01:50:15.590 --> 01:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
and testifying yes sir
 
01:50:18.830 --> 01:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
seeing you requiring permission for
 
01:50:20.410 --> 01:50:20.420 align:start position:0%
hunting on your properties do you get
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed with calls or is it just an
 
01:50:24.890 --> 01:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
appreciative thing to understand who's
 
01:50:26.450 --> 01:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
on your property
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
we don't get overwhelmed with calls
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:50:35.209 --> 01:50:35.219 align:start position:0%
I remembered again we're in Lebanon in
 
01:50:35.219 --> 01:50:36.649 align:start position:0%
I remembered again we're in Lebanon in
Plainfield

01:50:36.649 --> 01:50:36.659 align:start position:0%
Plainfield
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
um I remember a day when I thought we
 
01:50:39.890 --> 01:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
might be getting overwhelmed with
 
01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:41.870 align:start position:0%
might be getting overwhelmed with
hudders

01:50:41.870 --> 01:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
hudders
 
01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:43.310 align:start position:0%
hudders
um

01:50:43.310 --> 01:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:44.990 --> 01:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not sure where the edge of
 
01:50:49.970 --> 01:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed is with all that land I'm
 
01:50:52.370 --> 01:50:52.380 align:start position:0%
perfectly comfortable giving
 
01:50:55.970 --> 01:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
the 20 or 30 people who ask permission
 
01:50:58.010 --> 01:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
we usually have discussions about where
 
01:51:00.770 --> 01:51:00.780 align:start position:0%
other people are hunting
 
01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
um and as I say we we asked them not to
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
go certain places during periods
 
01:51:09.290 --> 01:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
but uh but no I mean I
 
01:51:13.070 --> 01:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
um I suppose if we got overwhelmed
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
um if it became a real profound nuisance
 
01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
we'd have to rethink but we've never had
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
to rethink I mean we've got I've got
 
01:51:22.189 --> 01:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
this stack of files I don't know why we
 
01:51:24.050 --> 01:51:24.060 align:start position:0%
even keep the files but we you know we
 
01:51:25.070 --> 01:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
have it
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's not like perforated we they fill
 
01:51:29.870 --> 01:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
out the whole thing and we keep one part
 
01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
and they take one part that says they
 
01:51:34.250 --> 01:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
have permission to hunt on our land and
 
01:51:35.930 --> 01:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
ours says what their license number and
 
01:51:37.790 --> 01:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
name and phone number and contact info
 
01:51:40.010 --> 01:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
is and that's that and like their their
 
01:51:41.930 --> 01:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
hunting license number as well
 
01:51:44.209 --> 01:51:44.219 align:start position:0%
and we get out of state Hunters as well
 
01:51:46.850 --> 01:51:46.860 align:start position:0%
I'm on occasion I mean if yeah okay
 
01:51:49.129 --> 01:51:49.139 align:start position:0%
here's a denial
 
01:51:51.709 --> 01:51:51.719 align:start position:0%
seven guys show up from Massachusetts
 
01:51:55.370 --> 01:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
well seven guys show up from anywhere
 
01:51:57.229 --> 01:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
one of them's looking a little bit tight
 
01:51:58.669 --> 01:51:58.679 align:start position:0%
and they all want to go out and Hunt
 
01:51:58.679 --> 01:52:00.709 align:start position:0%
and they all want to go out and Hunt
together

01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:52:03.649 --> 01:52:03.659 align:start position:0%
not today sir you know I mean we don't
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
we'll drop we don't let huge parties of
 
01:52:09.290 --> 01:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
people hunt together but that's out of
 
01:52:10.910 --> 01:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
respect to the other Hunters as much as
 
01:52:13.010 --> 01:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
anything else and also to our neighbors
 
01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
and you know whatever
 
01:52:17.149 --> 01:52:17.159 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative Khan
 
01:52:21.770 --> 01:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
taking my question is it possible that
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh only few property owners have their
 
01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
telephone number written in the property
 
01:52:33.229 --> 01:52:33.239 align:start position:0%
that's why no not too many Hunters can
 
01:52:36.169 --> 01:52:36.179 align:start position:0%
reach out to the property owners I
 
01:52:37.609 --> 01:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
thought it was required on a well
 
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
actually of course it's only required if
 
01:52:41.689 --> 01:52:41.699 align:start position:0%
you're posting your land
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I mean it's a it's an
 
01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:46.679 align:start position:0%
easy matter of record to find out who
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
owns a piece of land all the the the
 
01:52:51.229 --> 01:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
town databases they've all got I mean
 
01:52:53.570 --> 01:52:53.580 align:start position:0%
the property property maps are pretty
 
01:52:55.490 --> 01:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
good now technology is pretty good on
 
01:52:57.770 --> 01:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
that now you can you can you can find a
 
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
landowner quite easily so sorry but I
 
01:53:01.609 --> 01:53:01.619 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that question
 
01:53:04.790 --> 01:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
sir follow-up Mr chairman follow-up I
 
01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
just want to make this uh not a question
 
01:53:08.930 --> 01:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
but a statement that I have full support
 
01:53:11.570 --> 01:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
of your ownership of your property and
 
01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
your rights
 
01:53:14.689 --> 01:53:14.699 align:start position:0%
I think that's very kind of you to say
 
01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:16.199 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:53:18.169 --> 01:53:18.179 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:53:23.149 --> 01:53:23.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attention
 
01:53:26.689 --> 01:53:26.699 align:start position:0%
the chair will now call Joyce Brady who
 
01:53:28.129 --> 01:53:28.139 align:start position:0%
supports the bill and has asked for two
 
01:53:28.139 --> 01:53:29.270 align:start position:0%
supports the bill and has asked for two
minutes

01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:53:31.090 --> 01:53:31.100 align:start position:0%
if you could please stay to your time
 
01:53:34.370 --> 01:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
that'd be great
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record
 
01:53:38.450 --> 01:53:38.460 align:start position:0%
Joyce Brady I'm New Hampshire Farm
 
01:53:40.970 --> 01:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
Bureau president I'm a landowner and I'm
 
01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
a farmer
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
the unfortunate thing of testifying near
 
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
the end is everybody's already said
 
01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:47.810 align:start position:0%
the end is everybody's already said
everything

01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:53:50.689 --> 01:53:50.699 align:start position:0%
that could be a good thing right so now
 
01:53:52.729 --> 01:53:52.739 align:start position:0%
I have other things to say
 
01:53:54.770 --> 01:53:54.780 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire is a very unique State
 
01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
there's very few States and I'm I
 
01:53:58.570 --> 01:53:58.580 align:start position:0%
apologize I don't know exactly how many
 
01:54:02.990 --> 01:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
that give the privilege of hunting as
 
01:54:06.050 --> 01:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
long as the land's not posted
 
01:54:08.810 --> 01:54:08.820 align:start position:0%
so when the gentleman had had testified
 
01:54:11.470 --> 01:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
that our neighboring states don't
 
01:54:15.169 --> 01:54:15.179 align:start position:0%
require permission for cameras he forgot
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
to mention that they all require written
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
permission to hunt
 
01:54:19.199 --> 01:54:21.770 align:start position:0%
permission to hunt
anytime

01:54:21.770 --> 01:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
anytime
 
01:54:24.169 --> 01:54:24.179 align:start position:0%
so a lot of states you have to have
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
written permission to hunt
 
01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
anytime anywhere so New Hampshire
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
allows a very unique privilege to
 
01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:35.510 align:start position:0%
allows a very unique privilege to
Hunters

01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
Hunters
 
01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:38.820 align:start position:0%
the landowners in New Hampshire have the
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
right to make a decision do they want to
 
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
allow these Hunters
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
or do they not they post their land or
 
01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
they don't if they're in current use
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
there are other ways
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
um to have restrictions
 
01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:55.609 align:start position:0%
um to have restrictions
um

01:54:55.609 --> 01:54:55.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:58.430 --> 01:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
but it's the landowner's right to make
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
that decision
 
01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
as a hunter having a privilege
 
01:55:05.810 --> 01:55:05.820 align:start position:0%
you need to respect
 
01:55:08.570 --> 01:55:08.580 align:start position:0%
the owner the land you need to
 
01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate that privilege and out of
 
01:55:13.870 --> 01:55:13.880 align:start position:0%
appreciation and maybe it's just because
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
I grew up
 
01:55:18.169 --> 01:55:18.179 align:start position:0%
many years you know I'm one of the old
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
school people now I hate to say that but
 
01:55:23.090 --> 01:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
I am and it's about appreciation it's
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
about respect common courtesy we have
 
01:55:29.209 --> 01:55:29.219 align:start position:0%
seen more and more people moving up to
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
our state with a different mindset I
 
01:55:33.649 --> 01:55:33.659 align:start position:0%
think that's part of the problem between
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
the cheaper cameras and everybody has
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
access to them
 
01:55:40.729 --> 01:55:40.739 align:start position:0%
along with just a different mindset and
 
01:55:43.370 --> 01:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
we need to protect our landowners and
 
01:55:45.410 --> 01:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
give them the rights that they have
 
01:55:47.450 --> 01:55:47.460 align:start position:0%
through paying their taxes in their
 
01:55:51.470 --> 01:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
mortgage to say yes or no to cameras and
 
01:55:52.689 --> 01:55:52.699 align:start position:0%
let the hunter
 
01:55:55.729 --> 01:55:55.739 align:start position:0%
appreciate their privilege
 
01:55:57.770 --> 01:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
by making them at it's actually a sad
 
01:55:59.890 --> 01:55:59.900 align:start position:0%
day that they're we're here testifying
 
01:56:03.050 --> 01:56:03.060 align:start position:0%
asking Allah to be passed
 
01:56:05.149 --> 01:56:05.159 align:start position:0%
to make Hunters understand that they
 
01:56:07.310 --> 01:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
have a privilege and they should
 
01:56:09.950 --> 01:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%

01:57:01.910 --> 01:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
we see this as a great a balance strikes
 
01:57:04.010 --> 01:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
the right balance between protecting the
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
ability to continue the traditional open
 
01:57:08.810 --> 01:57:08.820 align:start position:0%
land use policies in New Hampshire as
 
01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:12.060 align:start position:0%

01:57:13.970 --> 01:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
respecting the privilege of the use of
 
01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
private land I forgot to bring the math
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%
math with me today but for every you
 
01:57:20.450 --> 01:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
know the math works out to roughly every
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
acre that's owned and managed by the
 
01:57:24.350 --> 01:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
state these guys in the back of the room
 
01:57:27.050 --> 01:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
here they manage about a hundred
 
01:57:28.370 --> 01:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
um so it's incredibly important to
 
01:57:30.290 --> 01:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
Sportsmen around the state that these
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
lands remain active and open for all
 
01:57:34.570 --> 01:57:34.580 align:start position:0%
recreational uses including Hunting
 
01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
Fishing and trapping
 
01:57:38.990 --> 01:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
um when we originally
 
01:57:40.970 --> 01:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
um started talking about this bill we
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
went down and we met with folks in the
 
01:57:44.450 --> 01:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
timber Timberland owners well the Farm
 
01:57:45.950 --> 01:57:45.960 align:start position:0%

01:57:47.689 --> 01:57:47.699 align:start position:0%
stories that these folks have had about

negative interactions with you know you
 
01:57:51.470 --> 01:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
know these guys will be the first person
 
01:57:53.450 --> 01:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
to tell you that 99 of the hunters are
 
01:57:56.209 --> 01:57:56.219 align:start position:0%
great but it's always the one percent
 
01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
um that they have some trouble with so
 
01:58:01.310 --> 01:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
we see this bill as a great balance game
 
01:58:03.709 --> 01:58:03.719 align:start position:0%
cameras are great piece of technology
 
01:58:05.629 --> 01:58:05.639 align:start position:0%
um when you're looking to recruit Young
 
01:58:08.450 --> 01:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
Folks into hunting a game camera is a
 
01:58:10.430 --> 01:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
great way to do it nothing gets a kid
 
01:58:11.930 --> 01:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
more excited than seeing the bear the
 
01:58:14.149 --> 01:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
deer on the camera and saying this is
 
01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:16.199 align:start position:0%

home so we want to we encourage uh you
 
01:58:20.450 --> 01:58:20.460 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:59:21.530 --> 01:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
I support the bill
 
01:59:24.589 --> 01:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
and in talking with
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
family neighbors friends as well as
 
01:59:31.010 --> 01:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
other Sportsmen and whatever is what's
 
01:59:33.950 --> 01:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
kind of helped me form my opinion I have
 
01:59:35.930 --> 01:59:35.940 align:start position:0%
to this day not had
 
01:59:38.810 --> 01:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
any abuse but one thing that has gotten
 
01:59:41.570 --> 01:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
my concern is and you've heard it over
 
01:59:43.250 --> 01:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
and over privacy
 
01:59:45.830 --> 01:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
I have a driveway that's a half a mile
 
01:59:48.770 --> 01:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
long off of a back road it's dead end
 
01:59:50.930 --> 01:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
nobody goes by the house or anything
 
01:59:54.770 --> 01:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
else on that driveway there's two very
 
01:59:57.050 --> 01:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
good deer Crossings
 
02:00:00.770 --> 02:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
and I don't mind people using for
 
02:00:05.089 --> 02:00:05.099 align:start position:0%
hunting but one of my big concerns is if
 
02:00:09.410 --> 02:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to rob me rip off I a lot
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
of equipment is not on the lock and key
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
or whatever and they can set up the
 
02:00:17.149 --> 02:00:17.159 align:start position:0%
cameras and find out when me and my wife
 
02:00:19.790 --> 02:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
leave when we return and then go help
 
02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:22.189 align:start position:0%
leave when we return and then go help
themselves

02:00:22.189 --> 02:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:00:24.109 --> 02:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
other than that I guess pretty much
 
02:00:27.709 --> 02:00:27.719 align:start position:0%
everything has been said as a sportsman
 
02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
I believe we owe the other landowners
 
02:00:36.910 --> 02:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
the courtesy of uh getting permission
 
02:00:40.970 --> 02:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the privilege that they
 
02:00:43.490 --> 02:00:43.500 align:start position:0%

traditional hunting Wildlife managements
 
02:02:41.810 --> 02:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
a big part of healthy Forest talk to any
 
02:02:43.970 --> 02:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
land manager who's trying to manage an
 
02:02:46.250 --> 02:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
area trying to manage a hardwood stand
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
in an area with a high dense moose
 
02:02:50.570 --> 02:02:50.580 align:start position:0%
populations they will be pulling their
 
02:02:52.250 --> 02:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
hair out telling you I can't get any
 
02:02:54.589 --> 02:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
regeneration because that darn moose
 
02:02:56.330 --> 02:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
just keeps coming through and mowing my
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
sugar maple and Yellow Birch saplings
 
02:03:04.189 --> 02:03:04.199 align:start position:0%
um so we we support hunting our members
 
02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
are are
 
02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
really involved in hunting personally I
 
02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
am as well I hunt
 
02:03:14.990 --> 02:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
um but what I want to say is this Bill
 
02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
yes it's about game cameras but and I
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
think you've heard about this this is
 
02:03:22.729 --> 02:03:22.739 align:start position:0%
about privacy you heard the terms common
 
02:03:25.729 --> 02:03:25.739 align:start position:0%
courtesy respect
 
02:03:25.739 --> 02:03:26.570 align:start position:0%
courtesy respect
um

02:03:26.570 --> 02:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:28.729 --> 02:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is putting
 
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
a device on someone's piece of property
 
02:03:35.209 --> 02:03:35.219 align:start position:0%
that takes an image or a video and in
 
02:03:37.970 --> 02:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
some cases can send it anywhere
 
02:03:40.370 --> 02:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
and if you think about that if I have a
 
02:03:42.410 --> 02:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
piece of property and someone's out
 
02:03:45.290 --> 02:03:45.300 align:start position:0%
taking images and then without my cons
 
02:03:47.149 --> 02:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
without my knowledge
 
02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
that to me is invasive and you know as a
 
02:03:53.570 --> 02:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
landowner and as someone who's who owns
 
02:03:56.450 --> 02:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
property you know I should at least have
 
02:03:58.970 --> 02:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
the courtesy of saying you know
 
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
put if you're going to put a camera up
 
02:04:03.470 --> 02:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
great just put it on the back 40 or put
 
02:04:05.930 --> 02:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
it over here this is an area that I use
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
with my family I hike with my grandkids
 
02:04:13.310 --> 02:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
Etc so I for us this is a this is a
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
personal property issue this is a it's a
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
property rights issue and you've heard
 
02:04:21.410 --> 02:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
from landowners today of all size
 
02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
ownerships Geographic this isn't just a
 
02:04:27.530 --> 02:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County issue this isn't just a
 
02:04:29.089 --> 02:04:29.099 align:start position:0%
koas county issue you heard it from
 
02:04:32.030 --> 02:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
landowners from across the state
 
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
um as the price of cameras have come
 
02:04:36.169 --> 02:04:36.179 align:start position:0%
down they have Pro there are more out
 
02:04:39.229 --> 02:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
there on the landscape and so that is
 
02:04:42.050 --> 02:04:42.060 align:start position:0%
that is kind of what has brought us here
 
02:04:44.750 --> 02:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
is you know this proliferation of these
 
02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:46.430 align:start position:0%
is you know this proliferation of these
cameras

02:04:46.430 --> 02:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
02:04:47.930 --> 02:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
people own land for a lot of different
 
02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:49.370 align:start position:0%
people own land for a lot of different
reasons

02:04:49.370 --> 02:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
um they own it as an investment they own
 
02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
it for recreation they own it as a
 
02:04:55.370 --> 02:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
buffer from Neighbors or it is an
 
02:04:57.169 --> 02:04:57.179 align:start position:0%
extension of their their home property
 
02:05:00.109 --> 02:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
and they own it for Solitude and in some
 
02:05:02.270 --> 02:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
cases some of our members they own it
 
02:05:04.910 --> 02:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
for work I may be a logger and I may go
 
02:05:06.890 --> 02:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
out and buy a couple thousand acres
 
02:05:08.570 --> 02:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
because that's where I'm going to work
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
this next winter that's that's kind of
 
02:05:14.810 --> 02:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
why I own why I would buy it
 
02:05:16.669 --> 02:05:16.679 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
02:05:19.609 --> 02:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
this notion about privacy and rights of
 
02:05:21.890 --> 02:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
privacy I wanted to touch on that
 
02:05:23.629 --> 02:05:23.639 align:start position:0%
because people own land for different
 
02:05:25.850 --> 02:05:25.860 align:start position:0%
reasons there are also parts of that
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
property that may be on the back 40 that
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
are particularly special I have I've
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
been on I've had the benefit of being
 
02:05:34.550 --> 02:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
with many of my members well they'll
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
take go for a walk in their forest and
 
02:05:38.570 --> 02:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
they'll take you to an area this is a
 
02:05:40.669 --> 02:05:40.679 align:start position:0%
really this is a really special spot
 
02:05:43.070 --> 02:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
this is where my grandfathers my
 
02:05:44.570 --> 02:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
father's ashes are
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
or this is a lookout this is where I
 
02:05:50.209 --> 02:05:50.219 align:start position:0%
propose to my wife what have you and
 
02:05:52.189 --> 02:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
these are areas on people's property
 
02:05:54.649 --> 02:05:54.659 align:start position:0%
that really mean something to them and
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
so the thought of having a camera placed
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
there without their knowledge is really
 
02:06:01.129 --> 02:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
kind of an affront to them and they say
 
02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
you know you know this is it just isn't
 
02:06:04.199 --> 02:06:04.970 align:start position:0%
you know you know this is it just isn't
right

02:06:04.970 --> 02:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:06:07.490 --> 02:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
ask for permission and I can say yeah
 
02:06:10.070 --> 02:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
don't put it on that the corner by the
 
02:06:11.930 --> 02:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
the stone wall in the old apple tree
 
02:06:14.149 --> 02:06:14.159 align:start position:0%
that's an area that's special to me in
 
02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:16.679 align:start position:0%
my family and so you know it was
 
02:06:18.770 --> 02:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
suggested earlier in some of the earlier
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that well maybe you just do a
 
02:06:23.089 --> 02:06:23.099 align:start position:0%
300 foot buffer area well that doesn't
 
02:06:25.250 --> 02:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
cover those types of situations it just
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
02:06:27.119 --> 02:06:28.430 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
um

02:06:28.430 --> 02:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:30.890 --> 02:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
and again as I mentioned I've had
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
members call and
 
02:06:34.550 --> 02:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know as I've heard from our members
 
02:06:37.310 --> 02:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
in there are a lot of members that'll
 
02:06:39.410 --> 02:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
say you know this is a privacy if I have
 
02:06:39.420 --> 02:06:40.790 align:start position:0%
say you know this is a privacy if I have
children

02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
um and I have children you know that I
 
02:06:45.109 --> 02:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
take out on the property or my grandkids
 
02:06:48.770 --> 02:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
I don't want potentially an image kind
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
of going out and who knows where um and
 
02:06:54.589 --> 02:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
so that's that's an issue
 
02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
um the other piece is in you know these
 
02:07:00.970 --> 02:07:00.980 align:start position:0%
cameras when we conducted Timber sale
 
02:07:04.189 --> 02:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
they're out there on the property and
 
02:07:06.109 --> 02:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
you'll have Foresters or loggers come
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
along and they're getting ready they're
 
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
marking the wood they're setting laying
 
02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
out the sale and here's a camera
 
02:07:13.370 --> 02:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
now what if there isn't if it isn't
 
02:07:15.649 --> 02:07:15.659 align:start position:0%
labeled what do I do with it we've been
 
02:07:16.970 --> 02:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
told by New Hampshire Fish and Game
 
02:07:19.490 --> 02:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
department that's private property don't
 
02:07:20.810 --> 02:07:20.820 align:start position:0%
take it down
 
02:07:23.330 --> 02:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
well I'm trying to I'm trying to work
 
02:07:25.790 --> 02:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
here trying to get a job done you know
 
02:07:28.129 --> 02:07:28.139 align:start position:0%
and I'm told not to take it down I don't
 
02:07:30.410 --> 02:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
know who to contact I feel like I'm in a
 
02:07:33.410 --> 02:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
catch-22 I call fishing game I'm sure
 
02:07:35.450 --> 02:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
they'll come out and take it but as I
 
02:07:38.030 --> 02:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
think we heard earlier you know there's
 
02:07:40.850 --> 02:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
people have many cameras as I think I
 
02:07:42.169 --> 02:07:42.179 align:start position:0%
heard earlier in earlier testimony
 
02:07:45.169 --> 02:07:45.179 align:start position:0%
dozens of cameras and I may miss one or
 
02:07:47.390 --> 02:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
I may forget where I put them I've heard
 
02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
from some hunting guides they'll put out
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
dozens and dozens of cameras and it's
 
02:07:54.530 --> 02:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
part of their business and that's great
 
02:07:58.070 --> 02:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
and that's fine but again at least give
 
02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
me the courtesy or give me the option to
 
02:08:01.129 --> 02:08:01.139 align:start position:0%
say look
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
where are you putting them I'd like to
 
02:08:05.450 --> 02:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
have some say in that and let's keep
 
02:08:07.010 --> 02:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
track of them so that if I'm going to
 
02:08:09.290 --> 02:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
lay out and harvest in a particular unit
 
02:08:12.169 --> 02:08:12.179 align:start position:0%
I know all right it's time to get the
 
02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:13.679 align:start position:0%
cameras out of that unit because we're
 
02:08:16.370 --> 02:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
going to go go do a harvest
 
02:08:16.380 --> 02:08:17.930 align:start position:0%
going to go go do a harvest
um

02:08:17.930 --> 02:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:20.330 --> 02:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
the last couple items I I want to just
 
02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
touch on is there was a question about
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
contacting Property Owners you had had
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
that conversation earlier about the
 
02:08:29.229 --> 02:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
signage for Mr wood
 
02:08:32.450 --> 02:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
anyone that hunts the these days you're
 
02:08:33.950 --> 02:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
probably familiar there are programs
 
02:08:35.330 --> 02:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
called Onyx and some of these other
 
02:08:37.490 --> 02:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
programs that are very good in helping
 
02:08:40.129 --> 02:08:40.139 align:start position:0%
identify who the landowner is so there
 
02:08:42.169 --> 02:08:42.179 align:start position:0%
is technology and of course there's the
 
02:08:43.609 --> 02:08:43.619 align:start position:0%
good old-fashioned go to the town hall
 
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
and pull up a tax card
 
02:08:47.810 --> 02:08:47.820 align:start position:0%
so there are ways to contact the
 
02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
landowner if you do want to find out
 
02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
okay who do I who do I contact if I want
 
02:08:55.609 --> 02:08:55.619 align:start position:0%
to put a put a camera out
 
02:08:58.010 --> 02:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
um the issue about being inundated or
 
02:09:00.589 --> 02:09:00.599 align:start position:0%
over overrun by request
 
02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:02.639 align:start position:0%
um when this issue came up before the
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
nhtoa two years ago it was a year ago
 
02:09:08.209 --> 02:09:08.219 align:start position:0%
two years ago we had a very lengthy
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
discussion about that issue and we feel
 
02:09:14.270 --> 02:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
that the posting the posting on the uh
 
02:09:16.609 --> 02:09:16.619 align:start position:0%
on the signage that posting paragraph
 
02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
saying we allow cameras we feel that
 
02:09:21.530 --> 02:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
sufficiently addresses it
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and that actually that suggestion
 
02:09:24.410 --> 02:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
came from one of our very large
 
02:09:26.330 --> 02:09:26.340 align:start position:0%
landowners up in the northern part of
 
02:09:27.770 --> 02:09:27.780 align:start position:0%
the state he says I don't want my
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
Foresters having to field hundreds of
 
02:09:32.330 --> 02:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
calls or dozens of calls is I just don't
 
02:09:35.089 --> 02:09:35.099 align:start position:0%
it's not an issue great we'll just put a
 
02:09:37.490 --> 02:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
sign up cameras permitted good you're
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
good to go
 
02:09:42.830 --> 02:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
lastly you know current use it's been
 
02:09:46.189 --> 02:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
raised in the recreational discount
 
02:09:47.930 --> 02:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
current use
 
02:09:49.850 --> 02:09:49.860 align:start position:0%
we're assessing land on its productive
 
02:09:52.129 --> 02:09:52.139 align:start position:0%
capability there is a there is an
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
additional incentive to keep your land
 
02:09:57.609 --> 02:09:57.619 align:start position:0%
open for Passive Recreation
 
02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:02.639 align:start position:0%
and pedestrian Recreation on on property
 
02:10:02.639 --> 02:10:03.470 align:start position:0%
and pedestrian Recreation on on property
um

02:10:03.470 --> 02:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:06.649 --> 02:10:06.659 align:start position:0%
again as I go back to the the what I had
 
02:10:09.169 --> 02:10:09.179 align:start position:0%
started with the ins you know installing
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
cameras to me is not passive Recreation
 
02:10:16.250 --> 02:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
um it just isn't passive Recreation and
 
02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
I would I would argue and contend that
 
02:10:23.450 --> 02:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
again just ask I think people will be
 
02:10:25.310 --> 02:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
very surprised that most landowners
 
02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
happy to let you put it out there just
 
02:10:30.770 --> 02:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
let me know where where it's going to go
 
02:10:32.510 --> 02:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
um with that I'll conclude my my
 
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'll be happy to answer
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you sir are there
 
02:10:39.229 --> 02:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:10:41.089 --> 02:10:41.099 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:10:45.050 --> 02:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you and the last card for the day
 
02:10:49.070 --> 02:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:53.450 --> 02:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:55.970 --> 02:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
thank you much I think people want lunch
 
02:10:59.689 --> 02:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
yes I certainly would join that uh if
 
02:11:02.750 --> 02:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
you're buying Mr chairman
 
02:11:04.729 --> 02:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
he didn't say yes so I guess we're going
 
02:11:06.589 --> 02:11:06.599 align:start position:0%
to be buying my own
 
02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
um so I view this already as a success
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
because quite frankly first of all I
 
02:11:13.070 --> 02:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
want to start by thanking before I
 
02:11:14.810 --> 02:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
forget it thanking every landowner in
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
here today uh who's come to testify you
 
02:11:19.490 --> 02:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
know who continually allows us a
 
02:11:21.470 --> 02:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
sportsman the chairman is the the vice
 
02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
chair is I know and maybe many more of
 
02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
you I certainly am for the opportunity
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
to hunt on your property I think it's
 
02:11:29.450 --> 02:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
incredibly generous of you
 
02:11:31.070 --> 02:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to thank you for that
 
02:11:33.470 --> 02:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
so and that brings me to why this bill
 
02:11:36.169 --> 02:11:36.179 align:start position:0%
was born so this is a piece of success
 
02:11:39.890 --> 02:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
because we were able to get uh the
 
02:11:42.169 --> 02:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
Timberlands Association landowners Farm
 
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
Bureau and sportsman through the
 
02:11:46.250 --> 02:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Federation which represents the
 
02:11:47.689 --> 02:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
largest group of Sportsmen in the state
 
02:11:49.970 --> 02:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
all together in agreement that something
 
02:11:52.669 --> 02:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
needs to be done and so the effort there
 
02:11:55.490 --> 02:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
was a lot of effort put forth to balance
 
02:11:58.189 --> 02:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
the rights of both the landowner which
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
is important to me and I'll tell you why
 
02:12:02.270 --> 02:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
in a minute and the Sportsman which is
 
02:12:04.490 --> 02:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
important to me because I am one so I
 
02:12:05.570 --> 02:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
didn't want this to be an
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
anti-sportsman's bill and I certainly
 
02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
didn't want it to throw landowners out
 
02:12:12.410 --> 02:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
of current use I think moving to that
 
02:12:15.050 --> 02:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
step is a mistake I think that's what's
 
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
happened in our western states there are
 
02:12:18.350 --> 02:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of western states where you can't
 
02:12:20.450 --> 02:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
hunt you can be shot for being on
 
02:12:22.850 --> 02:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
properties which we're very lucky in New
 
02:12:24.169 --> 02:12:24.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we don't have that we're a
 
02:12:25.790 --> 02:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
permissive State I'd like to do whatever
 
02:12:28.089 --> 02:12:28.099 align:start position:0%
I can while I'm here to make sure that
 
02:12:31.370 --> 02:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
continues the number one complaint I get
 
02:12:33.770 --> 02:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
in the fall the number one complaint and
 
02:12:36.050 --> 02:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
it's been going this way for a couple of
 
02:12:38.689 --> 02:12:38.699 align:start position:0%
years now is cameras and tree stands it
 
02:12:40.129 --> 02:12:40.139 align:start position:0%
is the number one complaint of
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
landowners landowners are shocked when
 
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
they call me and they say listen I found
 
02:12:46.490 --> 02:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
a bunch of cameras on my my lawn or my
 
02:12:48.589 --> 02:12:48.599 align:start position:0%
land and no one asked me permission for
 
02:12:50.149 --> 02:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
that and I tell them well they don't
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
really have to if you're not posted and
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
so it puts me in a bad spot as a
 
02:12:56.750 --> 02:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
sportsman because I work very hard not
 
02:12:59.209 --> 02:12:59.219 align:start position:0%
to tell the not to provide landowners
 
02:13:01.129 --> 02:13:01.139 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to confess to something a
 
02:13:02.569 --> 02:13:02.579 align:start position:0%
simple answer by saying all you got to
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
do is post your land and I can end this
 
02:13:06.530 --> 02:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
call in just a few minutes get some
 
02:13:08.270 --> 02:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
signs and I can read to you how it
 
02:13:09.950 --> 02:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
should be posted post your land it can't
 
02:13:12.770 --> 02:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
be on it that's not what we should be
 
02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
doing in fish and game I think we should
 
02:13:16.910 --> 02:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
be trying to mitigate as much as we can
 
02:13:18.830 --> 02:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
between the landowner and the hunters
 
02:13:21.050 --> 02:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
and this was an effort to do that so the
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
cameras have become more popular
 
02:13:23.930 --> 02:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
representative Smith asked us earlier
 
02:13:26.270 --> 02:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
and I think for two reasons one is the
 
02:13:28.490 --> 02:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
technology has really improved it's
 
02:13:31.310 --> 02:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
they're highly successful in harvesting
 
02:13:33.589 --> 02:13:33.599 align:start position:0%
game and the price I mean you can buy a
 
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
camera today for 39 so the price did it
 
02:13:38.270 --> 02:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
and I think the world we live in quite
 
02:13:40.910 --> 02:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
frankly dictated it I think Hunters see
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
it as a tool when they're working busy
 
02:13:46.250 --> 02:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
schedules like we all are and they put
 
02:13:47.569 --> 02:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
the cameras out to do some of that
 
02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
hunting so I crafted this originally and
 
02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
I worked with the two groups that I've
 
02:13:53.450 --> 02:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
already three groups that have already
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned that kind of word Smith that
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
make sure we're all on the same page and
 
02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
we worked very hard at it number of
 
02:14:00.109 --> 02:14:00.119 align:start position:0%
things happened here in the world of
 
02:14:02.030 --> 02:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
compromise and I'm not best known for
 
02:14:04.250 --> 02:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
compromise I'll be the first to admit so
 
02:14:06.169 --> 02:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
I want the record to reflect I'm here
 
02:14:08.569 --> 02:14:08.579 align:start position:0%
today prepared to do that because that's
 
02:14:10.129 --> 02:14:10.139 align:start position:0%
how important it is to the landowners
 
02:14:13.010 --> 02:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
behind me and and passing this is more
 
02:14:14.270 --> 02:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
important probably than some of the
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
things I personally want we put in I put
 
02:14:19.370 --> 02:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
in the paragraph about cellular cameras
 
02:14:21.050 --> 02:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
because that concerns me because it
 
02:14:22.970 --> 02:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
flies directly in the face of fair Chase
 
02:14:25.550 --> 02:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
I think as an agency we should promote
 
02:14:28.669 --> 02:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
Fair Chase cellular cameras the ones
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
that provide instant pictures to folks
 
02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
my experience has been and we do make
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
several cases on this now but my
 
02:14:36.709 --> 02:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
experience has been people are sitting
 
02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
in their homes they're setting these up
 
02:14:40.250 --> 02:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
on bait sites behind their homes not
 
02:14:41.450 --> 02:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
everybody but there are a number of
 
02:14:43.250 --> 02:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
people doing that and they're allowing
 
02:14:44.930 --> 02:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
the camera to do the hunt and to me
 
02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's not right and so my effort when
 
02:14:50.149 --> 02:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
we did this bill was to prevent that
 
02:14:52.010 --> 02:14:52.020 align:start position:0%
from happening I'm not going to die on
 
02:14:54.290 --> 02:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
my sword for that it's more important I
 
02:14:57.229 --> 02:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
think the rest of this and and so the
 
02:14:58.910 --> 02:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
other thing that came out in this from
 
02:15:01.069 --> 02:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
legislative Services was the written
 
02:15:03.770 --> 02:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
permission part and I think that I don't
 
02:15:06.050 --> 02:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
know why that was put in there I never
 
02:15:07.910 --> 02:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
intended anyone to get written
 
02:15:09.649 --> 02:15:09.659 align:start position:0%
permission and I didn't intend that for
 
02:15:11.930 --> 02:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
two reasons one I don't think landowners
 
02:15:13.550 --> 02:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
are comfortable doing it they feel like
 
02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
they're Believe It or Not landowners
 
02:15:17.450 --> 02:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
feel like if they sign their name that
 
02:15:19.729 --> 02:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
they're now responsible so they may say
 
02:15:22.490 --> 02:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
no just for that reason two I get
 
02:15:24.530 --> 02:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
permits all the time trapping permits
 
02:15:27.890 --> 02:15:27.900 align:start position:0%
tree stand permits uh uh baiting permits
 
02:15:30.350 --> 02:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
I don't need another permit all I want
 
02:15:32.569 --> 02:15:32.579 align:start position:0%
is Hunters to be able to get permission
 
02:15:34.069 --> 02:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
to be on there and they can do that
 
02:15:35.870 --> 02:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
verbally and so how would that work you
 
02:15:39.050 --> 02:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
would ask if a name is on a camera or a
 
02:15:40.550 --> 02:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
contact information I'll talk about that
 
02:15:42.830 --> 02:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
in a minute is on a camera and I can
 
02:15:45.229 --> 02:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
call Jim splain I'll pick on on
 
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative spleen I can call Jim and
 
02:15:49.069 --> 02:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
say hey Jim you're on representative
 
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
Brown's land did you have permission to
 
02:15:52.189 --> 02:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
put that camera out there yes I did I
 
02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
can check on that I can call Mr Brown if
 
02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
I if I want to and I can say did you
 
02:15:58.669 --> 02:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
give Jim splain permission I don't need
 
02:16:01.790 --> 02:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
a written permission slip so if that's a
 
02:16:03.589 --> 02:16:03.599 align:start position:0%
hang up for folks
 
02:16:05.390 --> 02:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
um now I need to be careful because I
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
don't know how many Commissioners are
 
02:16:08.270 --> 02:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
watching me testify my Commissioners but
 
02:16:09.890 --> 02:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
I am supposed to get permission for my
 
02:16:12.290 --> 02:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
commission if I make changes I certainly
 
02:16:14.209 --> 02:16:14.219 align:start position:0%
would bring that and encourage my
 
02:16:16.970 --> 02:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
commission to consider amending that
 
02:16:18.290 --> 02:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
piece of it we didn't write that
 
02:16:20.270 --> 02:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
originally I said permission I never
 
02:16:22.129 --> 02:16:22.139 align:start position:0%
said written and I think OLS used
 
02:16:23.930 --> 02:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
written because we use written and
 
02:16:25.370 --> 02:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
everything else so I think that's why
 
02:16:28.490 --> 02:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
that happened so and name and contact
 
02:16:31.310 --> 02:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
information is very important to be able
 
02:16:34.250 --> 02:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
to identify a camera that's not legal it
 
02:16:37.070 --> 02:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
also has a history of making people
 
02:16:40.849 --> 02:16:40.859 align:start position:0%
responsible I understand the concerns of
 
02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
you know putting my name and my contact
 
02:16:44.990 --> 02:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
I originally wrote name and address I
 
02:16:46.910 --> 02:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
rethought that and said name and contact
 
02:16:49.730 --> 02:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
information I am not in favor of just a
 
02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
cell phone I need a name or a way to get
 
02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
a name
 
02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
um because someone could just not answer
 
02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
the cell phone you could never get
 
02:16:58.910 --> 02:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
anyone to pick the phone up so then
 
02:17:00.770 --> 02:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
again I've got and here's the other
 
02:17:02.509 --> 02:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
thing that I didn't tell you we collect
 
02:17:05.330 --> 02:17:05.340 align:start position:0%
these I could probably open my own store
 
02:17:08.330 --> 02:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
I have hundreds of cameras that that
 
02:17:10.669 --> 02:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
people have never claimed because they
 
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
are they're afraid they're in trouble
 
02:17:13.370 --> 02:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
and I have no way to get them I don't
 
02:17:15.049 --> 02:17:15.059 align:start position:0%
want their cameras I want to get it back
 
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
to them it's their equipment but I have
 
02:17:18.530 --> 02:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
no way of knowing whose it is so believe
 
02:17:21.410 --> 02:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
it or not it would help us do that
 
02:17:24.290 --> 02:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
um I and and I will speak to this I know
 
02:17:26.330 --> 02:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
landowners I get it I'm I don't own
 
02:17:28.250 --> 02:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
anywhere near the some of the wonderful
 
02:17:30.530 --> 02:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
Acres these guys behind me own but I but
 
02:17:32.209 --> 02:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
what I do own is very important to me
 
02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
and I paid a lot of money for it um and
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
I and it is open to hunting and and
 
02:17:41.030 --> 02:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
fishing so or access to fishing so uh I
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
would be very upset if I saw a camera on
 
02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
my land and no one had the courtesy to
 
02:17:45.889 --> 02:17:45.899 align:start position:0%
just say hey I'm gonna put I don't even
 
02:17:47.509 --> 02:17:47.519 align:start position:0%
care where you put it I just want to
 
02:17:49.490 --> 02:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
know who it is so that I know someone
 
02:17:51.469 --> 02:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
out there is a sportsman it's not
 
02:17:53.330 --> 02:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
someone spying on me it's just a simple
 
02:17:55.790 --> 02:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
respect and courtesy
 
02:17:55.800 --> 02:17:56.629 align:start position:0%
respect and courtesy
um

02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
and I forget why I was going this way
 
02:18:02.450 --> 02:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
but um so putting oh I and I understand
 
02:18:04.969 --> 02:18:04.979 align:start position:0%
the desire when I find that as a
 
02:18:06.049 --> 02:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
landowner to go out and remove that
 
02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
that's my land and and I want to remove
 
02:18:10.129 --> 02:18:10.139 align:start position:0%
that let me tell you how that has
 
02:18:11.690 --> 02:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
created a problem I have a young lady
 
02:18:14.030 --> 02:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
called me she found a camera pointing
 
02:18:17.209 --> 02:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
towards her residence uh that she she
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
failed as some folks do she failed to
 
02:18:20.929 --> 02:18:20.939 align:start position:0%
tell me the whole story but the whole
 
02:18:22.849 --> 02:18:22.859 align:start position:0%
story was she used to live there she was
 
02:18:25.730 --> 02:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
she was thrown out of it by the town she
 
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
was going back to that home uh for
 
02:18:29.810 --> 02:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
whatever reason and so the police
 
02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
department put up a camera to watch the
 
02:18:34.310 --> 02:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
house she saw the camera on her house on
 
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
her own land she destroyed the camera to
 
02:18:36.889 --> 02:18:36.899 align:start position:0%
get it down and then the police
 
02:18:38.750 --> 02:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
department came after her to pay for the
 
02:18:40.910 --> 02:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
damages to the camera and and she her
 
02:18:42.349 --> 02:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
call to me was can they do that
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely they can do that that's their
 
02:18:46.310 --> 02:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
private property so if you go out and
 
02:18:48.290 --> 02:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
you cut a cable on a camera or you you
 
02:18:51.290 --> 02:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
do damage to a camera or if you give it
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
back to the Hunter and you've got a
 
02:18:54.410 --> 02:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
hunter who's miserable and he says oh my
 
02:18:55.790 --> 02:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
camera doesn't work anymore you're going
 
02:18:57.230 --> 02:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
to be liable for the damn
 
02:18:59.629 --> 02:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
to me it's better to have us do that law
 
02:19:01.070 --> 02:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement do that that's why law
 
02:19:02.509 --> 02:19:02.519 align:start position:0%
enforcement doesn't allow people to take
 
02:19:04.370 --> 02:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
abandoned cars doesn't allow them to do
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
any of that stuff because you're putting
 
02:19:09.169 --> 02:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
a landowner in in the uh those
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
crosshairs for time for liability so
 
02:19:13.730 --> 02:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
it's better to
 
02:19:16.549 --> 02:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
um call law enforcement to do that so
 
02:19:19.250 --> 02:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
uh 33 years I've been doing this I've
 
02:19:20.990 --> 02:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
never had a complaint from a landowner
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
who says I'm getting too many calls
 
02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
asking for permission I've never had
 
02:19:25.490 --> 02:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
that happen
 
02:19:27.889 --> 02:19:27.899 align:start position:0%
maybe that will happen in this but I but
 
02:19:29.509 --> 02:19:29.519 align:start position:0%
I believe if you're making them ask
 
02:19:30.770 --> 02:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
permission and they're posting their
 
02:19:32.089 --> 02:19:32.099 align:start position:0%
names on it you're not going to get that
 
02:19:33.709 --> 02:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
many people I'll tell you what you do
 
02:19:35.570 --> 02:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
get and it's appalling I don't know if
 
02:19:37.070 --> 02:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
any of you go to the deer hunting page
 
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
on the Facebook I'm not a social media
 
02:19:40.730 --> 02:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
guy but these young guys that I hire
 
02:19:42.709 --> 02:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
have driven me to do some of this much
 
02:19:45.650 --> 02:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
to my dismay and I follow that page on
 
02:19:48.290 --> 02:19:48.300 align:start position:0%
occasion you'd be amazed what you see so
 
02:19:50.030 --> 02:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
on more than one occasion I've seen
 
02:19:51.469 --> 02:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
folks with cameras that have been
 
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
hunting a piece of land like I do year
 
02:19:55.130 --> 02:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
after year after year and it slowly
 
02:19:57.230 --> 02:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
becomes my land because I'm shooting
 
02:19:58.849 --> 02:19:58.859 align:start position:0%
deer on it and I've never seen the
 
02:20:01.010 --> 02:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
landowner and so I get that thought
 
02:20:03.050 --> 02:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
process in my head that that's my spot
 
02:20:05.570 --> 02:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
and then they'll post a picture of
 
02:20:07.370 --> 02:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
someone walking in front of their camera
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
and they'll say do you know who this guy
 
02:20:11.810 --> 02:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
is he's on my he's in my spot on two
 
02:20:14.330 --> 02:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
occasions it's been the landowner
 
02:20:16.010 --> 02:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
now do I have to explain to you how
 
02:20:17.929 --> 02:20:17.939 align:start position:0%
angry they are when that happens and
 
02:20:19.969 --> 02:20:19.979 align:start position:0%
they see that and and people are
 
02:20:21.170 --> 02:20:21.180 align:start position:0%
swearing at them and they're the
 
02:20:23.389 --> 02:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
landowner he has more right to be there
 
02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
than anyone else so it's just an example
 
02:20:27.650 --> 02:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
of what I what we're trying to mitigate
 
02:20:29.929 --> 02:20:29.939 align:start position:0%
here and so this bill would go a long
 
02:20:31.570 --> 02:20:31.580 align:start position:0%
ways to do that
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative spleen brought a good
 
02:20:35.810 --> 02:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
point about you know do we need a
 
02:20:37.849 --> 02:20:37.859 align:start position:0%
criminal law no this law applies to
 
02:20:40.190 --> 02:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
everybody no matter what so the good
 
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
news in New Hampshire is criminal law
 
02:20:43.910 --> 02:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
and Fish and Game law apply to everybody
 
02:20:46.490 --> 02:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
equally so a trooper can enforce a fish
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
and game law I can enforce a criminal
 
02:20:51.950 --> 02:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
law so this law defines a camera not
 
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
just as a tool for hunting but as a tool
 
02:20:55.969 --> 02:20:55.979 align:start position:0%
for observation so you wouldn't need any
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
additional law this one would cover it
 
02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
all and as regards to the fine we
 
02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
originally put in a hundred dollar fine
 
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
I thought that was sufficient the Senate
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
boosted that up to a thousand they felt
 
02:21:08.809 --> 02:21:08.819 align:start position:0%
after the testimony that the hundred
 
02:21:10.910 --> 02:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
dollars wasn't enough and they boosted
 
02:21:13.370 --> 02:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
it to a thousand one other point I want
 
02:21:14.630 --> 02:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
to make about finds this young man
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
talking behind me the hunter it
 
02:21:18.590 --> 02:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
concerned me because he mentions that he
 
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
would have a lot of cameras out in this
 
02:21:21.710 --> 02:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
bill would come into effect we obviously
 
02:21:24.170 --> 02:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
wouldn't in the first year probably make
 
02:21:26.450 --> 02:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
any cases on this we would we would like
 
02:21:28.370 --> 02:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
we do with any law change significant
 
02:21:30.349 --> 02:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
change we would issue warnings to folks
 
02:21:32.809 --> 02:21:32.819 align:start position:0%
hey the law change you got to get your
 
02:21:34.010 --> 02:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
camera out of there you got to put your
 
02:21:35.570 --> 02:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
name on it you got to do all these
 
02:21:37.130 --> 02:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
things we would do that before we'd ever
 
02:21:40.670 --> 02:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
write a ticket the first 30 days so
 
02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:44.450 align:start position:0%
write a ticket the first 30 days so
um

02:21:44.450 --> 02:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
a couple things I want to just remind
 
02:21:47.809 --> 02:21:47.819 align:start position:0%
you of when you're thinking about voting
 
02:21:49.190 --> 02:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
for this there are a number of states
 
02:21:51.290 --> 02:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
out west there's a move in the west to
 
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
Outlaw cameras completely this has
 
02:21:55.610 --> 02:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
become such a problem in some places and
 
02:21:57.230 --> 02:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you the Outfitters out there
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
are using them the guide Outfitters that
 
02:22:01.250 --> 02:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
have multiple operations going they're
 
02:22:02.809 --> 02:22:02.819 align:start position:0%
putting cameras out they're
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
photographing trophy animals and they're
 
02:22:07.250 --> 02:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
selling the location to their to their
 
02:22:08.929 --> 02:22:08.939 align:start position:0%
Sports to their Hunters
 
02:22:11.150 --> 02:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
not necessarily I guess a horrible thing
 
02:22:12.650 --> 02:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
I don't like it but I don't but
 
02:22:14.270 --> 02:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
landowners are fed up with that because
 
02:22:15.710 --> 02:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
people are making money on their land
 
02:22:17.450 --> 02:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
and so the legislation I'm guessing
 
02:22:19.849 --> 02:22:19.859 align:start position:0%
that's why the legislature has moved
 
02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
Outlaw cameras so I don't want that to
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
happen in New Hampshire I want to get
 
02:22:25.969 --> 02:22:25.979 align:start position:0%
control of this before it gets worse and
 
02:22:27.770 --> 02:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
I and I would encourage you to remember
 
02:22:30.349 --> 02:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
that these complaints start in October
 
02:22:32.870 --> 02:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
and go right through into December
 
02:22:34.670 --> 02:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
um it is a number one complaint that we
 
02:22:36.290 --> 02:22:36.300 align:start position:0%
get and I think it could be fixed with
 
02:22:38.809 --> 02:22:38.819 align:start position:0%
something like this I don't know oh one
 
02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
other thing was the town that we we
 
02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:42.050 align:start position:0%
other thing was the town that we we
Exempted

02:22:42.050 --> 02:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
Exempted
 
02:22:44.330 --> 02:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
all public lands so we Exempted state
 
02:22:46.849 --> 02:22:46.859 align:start position:0%
land I said State managed land that was
 
02:22:48.469 --> 02:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
to cover White Mountain National Forest
 
02:22:48.479 --> 02:22:49.550 align:start position:0%
to cover White Mountain National Forest
properties

02:22:49.550 --> 02:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
properties
 
02:22:52.610 --> 02:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
uh Town lands Municipal lands are not
 
02:22:54.710 --> 02:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
private lands they have public lands so
 
02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
this law would not apply on Town only
 
02:23:00.410 --> 02:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
land state land uh Wildlife Management
 
02:23:02.809 --> 02:23:02.819 align:start position:0%
units or federal land it would only
 
02:23:05.330 --> 02:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
apply to privately owned properties so
 
02:23:07.010 --> 02:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't need to address that that's
 
02:23:08.510 --> 02:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
in there now
 
02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:10.010 align:start position:0%
in there now
okay

02:23:10.010 --> 02:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:23:10.020 --> 02:23:10.550 align:start position:0%
okay
um

02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:14.150 --> 02:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
and one other uh one other
 
02:23:16.429 --> 02:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
question I want to I guess I won't I
 
02:23:18.230 --> 02:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
guess I'm good unless you have questions
 
02:23:21.650 --> 02:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
of me I tried to sum this up as quickly
 
02:23:23.870 --> 02:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
as I could thank you Colonel are there
 
02:23:26.690 --> 02:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Smith
 
02:23:28.969 --> 02:23:28.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Colonel
 
02:23:31.309 --> 02:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions yes sir
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
um first question I have and I asked
 
02:23:34.849 --> 02:23:34.859 align:start position:0%
early on to I think someone else
 
02:23:34.859 --> 02:23:36.170 align:start position:0%
early on to I think someone else
testifying

02:23:36.170 --> 02:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
how would Fish and Game ensure that the
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
property owner has posted signage to
 
02:23:42.770 --> 02:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
ensure it's adequate in other words I
 
02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
can have eight miles of boundary along
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
with one sign yeah you could so you know
 
02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you the requirement
 
02:23:51.650 --> 02:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
for posting comes in if you are if you
 
02:23:54.290 --> 02:23:54.300 align:start position:0%
want to post your property and you want
 
02:23:56.450 --> 02:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the first person who
 
02:23:59.210 --> 02:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
trespass on your land we can prosecute
 
02:24:01.309 --> 02:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
there is a manner of posting for that
 
02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
and if you have followed that I can take
 
02:24:05.690 --> 02:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
the first person you call me on so when
 
02:24:07.309 --> 02:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
Jim spleen crosses onto your property
 
02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
you could call me this afternoon and Jim
 
02:24:11.030 --> 02:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
splain would get a ticket if you didn't
 
02:24:13.130 --> 02:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
have that sign in the right location or
 
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
you didn't have enough signs up I would
 
02:24:17.630 --> 02:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
then go to Jim splain and tell him
 
02:24:20.030 --> 02:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
this land is posted even though that
 
02:24:21.469 --> 02:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
sign wasn't up where you went in this
 
02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
land is posted you no longer can come
 
02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
back and then I can summons him the
 
02:24:28.849 --> 02:24:28.859 align:start position:0%
second time in in your case where we're
 
02:24:31.309 --> 02:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
not all they're doing is offering up
 
02:24:33.590 --> 02:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
that the land is open so if someone were
 
02:24:35.150 --> 02:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
to make a case if we went in and we
 
02:24:37.790 --> 02:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
found a camera uh and the guy said hey I
 
02:24:39.410 --> 02:24:39.420 align:start position:0%
saw a sign that said it was okay to put
 
02:24:41.030 --> 02:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
these cameras out there and we saw that
 
02:24:42.650 --> 02:24:42.660 align:start position:0%
sign no one's going to make a case on
 
02:24:44.750 --> 02:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
that as long as I don't see that same
 
02:24:47.630 --> 02:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
requirement being in place
 
02:24:49.250 --> 02:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
um that was something a landowners asked
 
02:24:50.270 --> 02:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
for because they didn't want to
 
02:24:52.370 --> 02:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
continually get the calls they felt that
 
02:24:54.230 --> 02:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
they would get a number of calls I I
 
02:24:56.270 --> 02:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
would predict you're not going to get a
 
02:24:58.849 --> 02:24:58.859 align:start position:0%
number of calls that's my prediction but
 
02:25:00.590 --> 02:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
but to answer your question it wouldn't
 
02:25:02.030 --> 02:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
be required
 
02:25:04.370 --> 02:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
02:25:06.710 --> 02:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative Khan
 
02:25:08.270 --> 02:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:25:10.429 --> 02:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
Connor Jordan for taking my question yes
 
02:25:10.439 --> 02:25:11.330 align:start position:0%
Connor Jordan for taking my question yes
sir

02:25:11.330 --> 02:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
sir
 
02:25:11.340 --> 02:25:12.530 align:start position:0%
sir
um

02:25:12.530 --> 02:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:15.170 --> 02:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
private property inside private property
 
02:25:17.330 --> 02:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
is not acceptable you know that is we
 
02:25:19.790 --> 02:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
all understand that knowing all those
 
02:25:23.570 --> 02:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
things you know the sign we just saw
 
02:25:26.210 --> 02:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
if the property owner doesn't have this
 
02:25:29.330 --> 02:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
sign in their property yeah there there
 
02:25:31.610 --> 02:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
could be a you know issue that Hunter
 
02:25:33.889 --> 02:25:33.899 align:start position:0%
didn't know about this law
 
02:25:37.070 --> 02:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
and how you resolve that issue so we res
 
02:25:39.469 --> 02:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
we resolved that all the time with folks
 
02:25:40.730 --> 02:25:40.740 align:start position:0%
that they we make it their
 
02:25:43.070 --> 02:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility to know the laws uh we
 
02:25:45.230 --> 02:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
would do Public Notices If This Were to
 
02:25:46.790 --> 02:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
change because this is a significant
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
change when when fishing games changes
 
02:25:51.590 --> 02:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
laws like this we release that publicly
 
02:25:54.110 --> 02:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
we also have a period of time within as
 
02:25:55.849 --> 02:25:55.859 align:start position:0%
I said within that first year where we
 
02:25:57.530 --> 02:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
cut people slack to kind of get them
 
02:25:59.929 --> 02:25:59.939 align:start position:0%
like we did with a lead when lead uh
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
fishing tackle came in I think it was
 
02:26:03.230 --> 02:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
two years before we ever issued a
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
summons for it we want to make sure
 
02:26:06.889 --> 02:26:06.899 align:start position:0%
everybody was aware and up to speed with
 
02:26:09.170 --> 02:26:09.180 align:start position:0%
it so we we take that into account and
 
02:26:11.150 --> 02:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
then we publicize the change
 
02:26:13.550 --> 02:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
the other thing I want to speak to Mr
 
02:26:15.170 --> 02:26:15.180 align:start position:0%
chairman was a suggestion you had made
 
02:26:16.490 --> 02:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
me privately I hope it's all right to
 
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
bring it up contact information being a
 
02:26:21.290 --> 02:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
cell number and maybe a hunting license
 
02:26:23.090 --> 02:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
number that's a great idea but when I
 
02:26:24.710 --> 02:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
was in the back of the room the only
 
02:26:26.330 --> 02:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
problem I think that that might create
 
02:26:27.889 --> 02:26:27.899 align:start position:0%
if we have someone out there watching
 
02:26:29.630 --> 02:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
Wildlife it's not required to have a
 
02:26:31.550 --> 02:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
hunting license so I don't know how they
 
02:26:33.889 --> 02:26:33.899 align:start position:0%
would do it unless we allow for them to
 
02:26:36.110 --> 02:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
put their name I'm okay with that but
 
02:26:39.530 --> 02:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
but I understand the concerns that that
 
02:26:41.330 --> 02:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
Diane has brought up with putting your
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
name posting your name and having access
 
02:26:45.170 --> 02:26:45.180 align:start position:0%
to that the only thing I'd remind you we
 
02:26:46.610 --> 02:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
do require that on a number of things
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
now we've not had any issues Trappers
 
02:26:50.450 --> 02:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
have to have their name and address we
 
02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
should probably go back and change that
 
02:26:54.410 --> 02:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
in today's world uh bow Hunters have to
 
02:26:56.150 --> 02:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
have it on and bait stands have to be
 
02:26:58.190 --> 02:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
posted with their name so we're doing
 
02:26:59.809 --> 02:26:59.819 align:start position:0%
that a lot now and we're not having
 
02:27:02.330 --> 02:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
issues but I'm hoping as long as I get
 
02:27:03.950 --> 02:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
as we can figure out who the owner is
 
02:27:06.590 --> 02:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
I'm good with whatever we come up with
 
02:27:08.270 --> 02:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you as long as my commission is
 
02:27:10.190 --> 02:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
next year let's try to make all the
 
02:27:12.110 --> 02:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
names uniform in the way we tell them
 
02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
how to put it so that all of the things
 
02:27:16.250 --> 02:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
we have to label right have it all the
 
02:27:17.570 --> 02:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
same we should we should go back and
 
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
change something we can do that as a
 
02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
housekeeping representative goalie
 
02:27:23.330 --> 02:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Colonel
 
02:27:25.730 --> 02:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:27:28.250 --> 02:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
02:27:30.650 --> 02:27:30.660 align:start position:0%
okay if we just put the language to say
 
02:27:34.309 --> 02:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
your name or license number
 
02:27:36.889 --> 02:27:36.899 align:start position:0%
yes those who don't hunt I didn't have a
 
02:27:38.090 --> 02:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
name and if you hunt you can just put
 
02:27:39.710 --> 02:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
your license I think that would be okay
 
02:27:41.690 --> 02:27:41.700 align:start position:0%
yes I think my commission could support
 
02:27:44.710 --> 02:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
that okay any further questions
 
02:27:46.550 --> 02:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and then
 
02:27:48.110 --> 02:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
representative Brown thank you Mr
 
02:27:49.910 --> 02:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Colonel again yes
 
02:27:51.830 --> 02:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
sir I have a question regarding I'm
 
02:27:53.150 --> 02:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
going to read what this says it's in
 
02:27:55.370 --> 02:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
paragraph four
 
02:27:57.230 --> 02:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
um a property owner shall contact a
 
02:27:58.910 --> 02:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
local or state law enforcement officer
 
02:28:00.889 --> 02:28:00.899 align:start position:0%
or conservation officer to remove and
 
02:28:02.570 --> 02:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
seize a game camera which was placed in
 
02:28:04.490 --> 02:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
violation of this section
 
02:28:06.650 --> 02:28:06.660 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
02:28:09.290 --> 02:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
twofold one what would be the violation
 
02:28:12.170 --> 02:28:12.180 align:start position:0%
if they didn't do that and two where in
 
02:28:14.050 --> 02:28:14.060 align:start position:0%
state law does it say they can't remove
 
02:28:16.429 --> 02:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
property that's been placed on their own
 
02:28:18.410 --> 02:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
personal property without getting
 
02:28:19.969 --> 02:28:19.979 align:start position:0%
permission from phishing it doesn't
 
02:28:21.710 --> 02:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
there's no law against that so they
 
02:28:23.450 --> 02:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be violating any law the only
 
02:28:25.309 --> 02:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
thing they'd be opening themselves up to
 
02:28:27.469 --> 02:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
is the Civil liability if they do damage
 
02:28:29.929 --> 02:28:29.939 align:start position:0%
to it or don't return it they'd have to
 
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
return it immediately because it believe
 
02:28:33.230 --> 02:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
it or not as crazy as it is that's
 
02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
personal property that could be charged
 
02:28:37.610 --> 02:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
with theft so it just my suggestion of
 
02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
not allowing them to do that just
 
02:28:41.150 --> 02:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
exempts them from all of that but let me
 
02:28:42.830 --> 02:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
be clear there's no law that that
 
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
prevents it now a land we have
 
02:28:46.610 --> 02:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
landowners do that there's no law they
 
02:28:49.010 --> 02:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
haven't violated the law they've exposed
 
02:28:51.650 --> 02:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
themselves to liability if there's an
 
02:28:54.050 --> 02:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
issue thank you follow up real quick
 
02:28:54.060 --> 02:28:55.250 align:start position:0%
issue thank you follow up real quick
follow-up

02:28:55.250 --> 02:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:28:58.429 --> 02:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
so if I found a backpack in my just like
 
02:28:59.990 --> 02:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
a game camera I have every right to take
 
02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
that absolutely not being criminally
 
02:29:04.370 --> 02:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
charged you absolutely do you'd be if
 
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
you did damage to it or didn't return it
 
02:29:08.510 --> 02:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
you could face criminal charges or civil
 
02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:09.770 align:start position:0%
you could face criminal charges or civil
yes

02:29:09.770 --> 02:29:09.780 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative Brown
 
02:29:14.809 --> 02:29:14.819 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:29:17.330 --> 02:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
Colonel yes sir take my question
 
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
um we talked a lot about what's
 
02:29:20.690 --> 02:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
enforceable or not in the lobster Bill
 
02:29:24.290 --> 02:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
sure so what
 
02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
um what's your thought about the wording
 
02:29:29.150 --> 02:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh on line 12 about the 24 hours so it
 
02:29:31.490 --> 02:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
says within 24 hours of remotely viewing
 
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
any image of that animal from a game
 
02:29:35.330 --> 02:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
camera that area that's probably
 
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
something you can't really enforce on so
 
02:29:39.469 --> 02:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you we when we wrote that into
 
02:29:41.690 --> 02:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
rule our goal was to show the world
 
02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
frankly that we were trying to a peace
 
02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
Fair Chase we didn't ever expect to make
 
02:29:48.410 --> 02:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
a case for that very reason quite
 
02:29:50.330 --> 02:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
frankly we make a lot of cases on it and
 
02:29:52.750 --> 02:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why we're doing it
 
02:29:55.969 --> 02:29:55.979 align:start position:0%
we're asking people based on the facts
 
02:29:57.710 --> 02:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
and circumstances of when we find these
 
02:29:59.210 --> 02:29:59.220 align:start position:0%
things for instance a bait site with a
 
02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
cellular camera on it and and people are
 
02:30:03.889 --> 02:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
telling us when those pictures are taken
 
02:30:06.349 --> 02:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
so we're making a lot of cases on it so
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
I just thought it was better as an
 
02:30:10.910 --> 02:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
agency to promote Fair Chase principles
 
02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
and that's why we did it originally that
 
02:30:15.889 --> 02:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
and that I put that in here it's in Rule
 
02:30:17.870 --> 02:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
now so we're enforcing it like that now
 
02:30:20.389 --> 02:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
in our administrative rules I felt if
 
02:30:21.889 --> 02:30:21.899 align:start position:0%
we're going to create a rule for cameras
 
02:30:23.450 --> 02:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
we should be up front and put that up
 
02:30:23.460 --> 02:30:24.770 align:start position:0%
we should be up front and put that up
front

02:30:24.770 --> 02:30:24.780 align:start position:0%
front
 
02:30:27.410 --> 02:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
02:30:29.330 --> 02:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
I do have one more thank you you may
 
02:30:31.370 --> 02:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
02:30:33.770 --> 02:30:33.780 align:start position:0%
um do you have a feeling about the the
 
02:30:36.590 --> 02:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
amount of the fine you would initially
 
02:30:37.610 --> 02:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
went with a hundred and then you
 
02:30:39.590 --> 02:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
acquiesce to the Thousand from Senate it
 
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
seems a little high to me do you have a
 
02:30:45.290 --> 02:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
number that you prefer so I I wrote in a
 
02:30:45.300 --> 02:30:46.550 align:start position:0%
number that you prefer so I I wrote in a
hundred

02:30:46.550 --> 02:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
because I I was envisioning multiple
 
02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
cameras so a thousand concerns my
 
02:30:54.469 --> 02:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
experience has been with my with all
 
02:30:57.349 --> 02:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
officers if the fine is really high they
 
02:31:00.170 --> 02:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
don't issue it they issue warnings and
 
02:31:02.030 --> 02:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
so you don't get good enforcement to me
 
02:31:05.150 --> 02:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
we should I to me I think we should come
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
back a little bit the other way half
 
02:31:09.670 --> 02:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
halfway and and mirror it to other
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
equipment violations thank you yes sir
 
02:31:15.410 --> 02:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative page
 
02:31:17.330 --> 02:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
that was my question oh okay uh
 
02:31:17.340 --> 02:31:18.950 align:start position:0%
that was my question oh okay uh
representative

02:31:18.950 --> 02:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:20.750 align:start position:0%
representative
oulette

02:31:20.750 --> 02:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
oulette
 
02:31:23.870 --> 02:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Colonel yes as
 
02:31:26.929 --> 02:31:26.939 align:start position:0%
I read the fine session it says up to a
 
02:31:28.270 --> 02:31:28.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that's correct
 
02:31:30.590 --> 02:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
mandatory correct that's that's a good
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
point that's exactly right so and I you
 
02:31:35.690 --> 02:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
know now that you said that I think
 
02:31:37.309 --> 02:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
that's because that's the way it's
 
02:31:39.410 --> 02:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
written in criminal code for violations
 
02:31:41.870 --> 02:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
is up to a thousand dollars but that's
 
02:31:43.309 --> 02:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
exactly what I said to the vice chair
 
02:31:45.410 --> 02:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
here is is the the up to a thousand
 
02:31:47.150 --> 02:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
dollars was not off of your fine
 
02:31:49.429 --> 02:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
schedule no they used the criminal code
 
02:31:51.230 --> 02:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
that's correct which
 
02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
we're not used to seeing because we
 
02:31:54.710 --> 02:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
usually see your fines right we have set
 
02:31:56.929 --> 02:31:56.939 align:start position:0%
Vines normally but I I would be open to
 
02:31:58.610 --> 02:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
a lesser fine but you're right that's a
 
02:32:01.550 --> 02:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
02:32:06.290 --> 02:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
pair this is sort of a follow-up to that
 
02:32:08.330 --> 02:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
so with up to a thousand dollars you
 
02:32:11.510 --> 02:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
already have the um luxury of charging
 
02:32:13.969 --> 02:32:13.979 align:start position:0%
less we could defense could be a hundred
 
02:32:15.710 --> 02:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
dollars second offense blah blah blah as
 
02:32:17.630 --> 02:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
long as somebody's a repeat offender or
 
02:32:20.150 --> 02:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
has 27 cameras out there a thousand
 
02:32:22.429 --> 02:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
dollars sounds good as long as the judge
 
02:32:23.870 --> 02:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
approved it that's correct it'll be
 
02:32:26.450 --> 02:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
subject to judicial approval but yes you
 
02:32:28.070 --> 02:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
could that's what it's that's why it's
 
02:32:29.389 --> 02:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
worded that way
 
02:32:32.210 --> 02:32:32.220 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
02:32:34.429 --> 02:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to leave you with one yes
 
02:32:37.309 --> 02:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
which is uh do you mind if this takes
 
02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
effect on a January 1st rather than
 
02:32:42.110 --> 02:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
within 60 days I don't think that's an
 
02:32:44.270 --> 02:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
issue I I don't I don't believe it's an
 
02:32:46.130 --> 02:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
issue I found that trying to get things
 
02:32:48.110 --> 02:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
through rules tends to be better if it's
 
02:32:50.750 --> 02:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
a January 1st date rather than a 60 days
 
02:32:52.790 --> 02:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
that's always we don't ever push that
 
02:32:55.190 --> 02:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's always left up to the legislature
 
02:32:56.510 --> 02:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
02:32:59.090 --> 02:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing no further questions
 
02:33:02.750 --> 02:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the testimony on SB
 
02:33:07.490 --> 02:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:09.469 --> 02:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
committee we've gone over your lunch
 
02:33:11.330 --> 02:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
time a little bit what we're going to do
 
02:33:14.389 --> 02:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
is come back at 1 30 for the one o'clock
 
02:33:15.710 --> 02:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
Bill and I'm gonna have the assistant
 
02:33:17.450 --> 02:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
post a notice on the door that the bill
 
02:33:19.309 --> 02:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
will start at 1 30. we are allowed to
 
02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
start later than the time we're just not
 
02:33:22.610 --> 02:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
allowed to start before the time that's
 
02:33:25.190 --> 02:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
posted so uh everybody can still have an
 
03:35:23.330 --> 03:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:25.030 --> 03:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
03:35:30.950 --> 03:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:33.110 --> 03:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
I already got a bunch of those uh
 
03:35:35.690 --> 03:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
different build I guess oh same person
 
03:35:41.630 --> 03:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:43.969 --> 03:35:43.979 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the hearing on SB 15
 
03:35:45.769 --> 03:35:45.779 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to recognize Senator
 
03:35:53.690 --> 03:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:55.250 --> 03:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the fish and
 
03:35:56.450 --> 03:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
game committee it's a pleasure to be
 
03:35:59.690 --> 03:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
back on the house side again and uh I
 
03:36:03.170 --> 03:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
want to introduce Senate Bill 15 FM for
 
03:36:04.490 --> 03:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Senator Howard
 
03:36:07.309 --> 03:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
Pearl representing District 17 and I
 
03:36:09.469 --> 03:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
live in Loudon
 
03:36:12.290 --> 03:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
I'm introducing SB 15fn at the request
 
03:36:14.090 --> 03:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
of the Fish and Game Commission to add
 
03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
language regulating tree stands
 
03:36:18.590 --> 03:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully it will provide Clarity that
 
03:36:20.690 --> 03:36:20.700 align:start position:0%
permanent tree stands require written
 
03:36:22.670 --> 03:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
permission from the landowner the
 
03:36:24.349 --> 03:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
current language does not differentiate
 
03:36:26.330 --> 03:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
between permanent or temporary tree
 
03:36:26.340 --> 03:36:27.769 align:start position:0%
between permanent or temporary tree
stands

03:36:27.769 --> 03:36:27.779 align:start position:0%
stands
 
03:36:29.929 --> 03:36:29.939 align:start position:0%
also it will provide time frames for
 
03:36:32.389 --> 03:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
erecting portable tree stands if a
 
03:36:33.889 --> 03:36:33.899 align:start position:0%
property owner permits hunting on their
 
03:36:35.809 --> 03:36:35.819 align:start position:0%
land temporary tree stands are allowed
 
03:36:37.550 --> 03:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
without the need for written permission
 
03:36:41.510 --> 03:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
between August 1st and December 31st
 
03:36:42.710 --> 03:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
additionally it will add a new
 
03:36:44.330 --> 03:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
requirement for the labeling of tree
 
03:36:46.849 --> 03:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
stands all tree stands will be required
 
03:36:49.370 --> 03:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
to the name and contact information of
 
03:36:51.650 --> 03:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
the tree stand owner that's in the event
 
03:36:53.450 --> 03:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
that an issue arises and that needs to
 
03:36:54.889 --> 03:36:54.899 align:start position:0%
be addressed
 
03:36:56.269 --> 03:36:56.279 align:start position:0%
the tree stand language was first
 
03:36:58.610 --> 03:36:58.620 align:start position:0%
brought forward in the Senate amendment
 
03:37:01.429 --> 03:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 490 last session but that
 
03:37:02.750 --> 03:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
bill ultimately died during the
 
03:37:05.090 --> 03:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
committee of conference process however
 
03:37:06.830 --> 03:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
landowners continue to call Fish and
 
03:37:08.570 --> 03:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
Game to express their frustration that
 
03:37:10.729 --> 03:37:10.739 align:start position:0%
these changes are not in current law
 
03:37:13.429 --> 03:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
the intent of Senate Bill 15 FN is to
 
03:37:15.530 --> 03:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
address those complaints so landowners
 
03:37:17.269 --> 03:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
will keep their lands open for hunting
 
03:37:19.370 --> 03:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
and recreational purposes
 
03:37:21.530 --> 03:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
this bill is supported by both the New
 
03:37:23.090 --> 03:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Timberland Owners Association
 
03:37:25.849 --> 03:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire Farm Bureau we do
 
03:37:27.349 --> 03:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
have Colonel Jordan here from Fish and
 
03:37:29.510 --> 03:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
Game and he'll certainly answer any of
 
03:37:31.250 --> 03:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
the technical questions you have but I'm
 
03:37:32.870 --> 03:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
willing to answer anything you have from
 
03:37:32.880 --> 03:37:35.030 align:start position:0%
willing to answer anything you have from
me

03:37:35.030 --> 03:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:37:37.250 --> 03:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and for
 
03:37:39.229 --> 03:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill and welcome back
 
03:37:43.130 --> 03:37:43.140 align:start position:0%
good to be here any questions
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
Senator representative Smith thank you
 
03:37:47.809 --> 03:37:47.819 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you senator
 
03:37:49.429 --> 03:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
reading through the bill I just have a
 
03:37:51.110 --> 03:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
question maybe you can clarify it it
 
03:37:52.910 --> 03:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
says no person shall construct a
 
03:37:54.469 --> 03:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
permanent tree stand or observation
 
03:37:56.690 --> 03:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
blind without written permission from
 
03:37:58.849 --> 03:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
the property owner or designee
 
03:38:01.010 --> 03:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
permanent could be subjective how would
 
03:38:03.710 --> 03:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
you clarify permanent because there's uh
 
03:38:05.210 --> 03:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
these blinds that are considered hard
 
03:38:07.910 --> 03:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
signal excuse me hard sided panel blind
 
03:38:09.410 --> 03:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
ground blinds where you can pop them
 
03:38:11.030 --> 03:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
together take them apart is that
 
03:38:13.070 --> 03:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
permanent not permanent it seems like it
 
03:38:14.929 --> 03:38:14.939 align:start position:0%
could be a gray area there when it comes
 
03:38:16.610 --> 03:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
to determining what is permanent well
 
03:38:17.990 --> 03:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question and this bill is
 
03:38:20.510 --> 03:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
really referring to tree stands and not
 
03:38:22.849 --> 03:38:22.859 align:start position:0%
not anything on ground Mount and I I
 
03:38:24.290 --> 03:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
think you'll I'll let the colonel speak
 
03:38:25.490 --> 03:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
to this but I think you're going to find
 
03:38:28.309 --> 03:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
that the the definition that is referred
 
03:38:29.809 --> 03:38:29.819 align:start position:0%
to by permanent means anything that's
 
03:38:32.030 --> 03:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
affixed to the tree using some type of a
 
03:38:34.550 --> 03:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
permanent lag nail not not something
 
03:38:36.410 --> 03:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
that's strapped on it you know could be
 
03:38:39.229 --> 03:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
a with a ratchet strap or something like
 
03:38:40.130 --> 03:38:40.140 align:start position:0%
that I think they're looking at
 
03:38:41.269 --> 03:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
something that's going to permeate the
 
03:38:44.030 --> 03:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
tree bark and and you know indicate more
 
03:38:45.410 --> 03:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
of a permanent structure than something
 
03:38:47.750 --> 03:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's temporary but I'll let I'll let
 
03:38:49.309 --> 03:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
the colonel speak to that a little
 
03:38:53.389 --> 03:38:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:56.269 --> 03:38:56.279 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:38:58.190 --> 03:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Senator well you
 
03:38:59.870 --> 03:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
guys gonna let me off easy
 
03:39:02.570 --> 03:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
it seems so all right well thank you
 
03:39:06.050 --> 03:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:10.309 --> 03:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:18.969 --> 03:39:18.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:21.110 --> 03:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon like probably faster than
 
03:39:22.130 --> 03:39:22.140 align:start position:0%
two minutes
 
03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
um Kyle Baker with Wildlife Federation
 
03:39:26.090 --> 03:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
I'm just here to support the bill
 
03:39:28.610 --> 03:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
um to us it's a pretty basic
 
03:39:29.929 --> 03:39:29.939 align:start position:0%
um if you're going to leave a piece of
 
03:39:31.490 --> 03:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
gear on somebody else's property you
 
03:39:32.389 --> 03:39:32.399 align:start position:0%
should put your name and contact
 
03:39:33.889 --> 03:39:33.899 align:start position:0%
information on it
 
03:39:35.269 --> 03:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
um it makes sense it's better for the
 
03:39:37.070 --> 03:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
Sportsman it helps prevent gear getting
 
03:39:38.630 --> 03:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
stolen if it does get stolen getting
 
03:39:40.610 --> 03:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
back to the proper the proper owner as
 
03:39:41.929 --> 03:39:41.939 align:start position:0%
well as gives the opportunity for a
 
03:39:43.309 --> 03:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
landowner to reach out if they have
 
03:39:44.929 --> 03:39:44.939 align:start position:0%
concerns about where the stand is placed
 
03:39:44.939 --> 03:39:46.130 align:start position:0%
concerns about where the stand is placed
so

03:39:46.130 --> 03:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:47.750 --> 03:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
um that's it just wanted to Echo our
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
support uh but happy to take any
 
03:39:49.439 --> 03:39:51.229 align:start position:0%
support uh but happy to take any
questions

03:39:51.229 --> 03:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:39:55.330 --> 03:39:55.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:57.650 --> 03:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
representative Brown thank you Mr chair
 
03:40:00.830 --> 03:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
do you have a feeling on time frame of
 
03:40:03.410 --> 03:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
this uh we're open to time frame uh you
 
03:40:05.090 --> 03:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
know the main thing for us was that
 
03:40:06.410 --> 03:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
folks should be checking their stands at
 
03:40:07.969 --> 03:40:07.979 align:start position:0%
least once a year
 
03:40:09.950 --> 03:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
um the the straps can get dry rotted if
 
03:40:11.330 --> 03:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
they're out in the sun the straps can
 
03:40:13.130 --> 03:40:13.140 align:start position:0%
get frozen or this just deteriorate over
 
03:40:13.140 --> 03:40:14.450 align:start position:0%
get frozen or this just deteriorate over
time

03:40:14.450 --> 03:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:40:16.429 --> 03:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
um think anything you know there are
 
03:40:17.870 --> 03:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
just you know metal equipment they can
 
03:40:20.090 --> 03:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
start to degrade over time so not only
 
03:40:22.969 --> 03:40:22.979 align:start position:0%
checking it uh once uh once a year is
 
03:40:24.590 --> 03:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
important but also that interaction
 
03:40:26.330 --> 03:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
between the Hunter and the landowner is
 
03:40:28.550 --> 03:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
important so if your landowner says hey
 
03:40:30.170 --> 03:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
you can keep it up in perpetuity we
 
03:40:31.190 --> 03:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
still think you should be out there at
 
03:40:32.210 --> 03:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
least once a year checking your
 
03:40:34.309 --> 03:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
equipment but if you want to leave it
 
03:40:35.990 --> 03:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's between you and the landowner but
 
03:40:38.750 --> 03:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
as far as what time of year you do that
 
03:40:40.849 --> 03:40:40.859 align:start position:0%
um you know we've heard you know we
 
03:40:42.170 --> 03:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
talked to the chairman you know in the
 
03:40:43.250 --> 03:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
in the dead of winter might not
 
03:40:44.690 --> 03:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
necessarily be the safest time to do it
 
03:40:44.700 --> 03:40:45.710 align:start position:0%
necessarily be the safest time to do it
so

03:40:45.710 --> 03:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:40:47.389 --> 03:40:47.399 align:start position:0%
um we're happy to
 
03:40:49.670 --> 03:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
whatever we think whatever everybody can
 
03:40:51.790 --> 03:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
agree on is fine with us
 
03:40:54.710 --> 03:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:40:56.330 --> 03:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much for your
 
03:40:56.340 --> 03:40:59.150 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much for your
testimony

03:40:59.150 --> 03:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:02.030 --> 03:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
the chair calls Stephen wood
 
03:41:07.670 --> 03:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:09.950 --> 03:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
oh thank you again
 
03:41:12.410 --> 03:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
um for listening to my nonsense
 
03:41:14.570 --> 03:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
um I am still Stephen wood I still own a
 
03:41:16.690 --> 03:41:16.700 align:start position:0%
bunch of land in Lebanon and Plainfield
 
03:41:18.889 --> 03:41:18.899 align:start position:0%
unless Something's Happened in my
 
03:41:21.710 --> 03:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
absence today I still manage poverty
 
03:41:24.530 --> 03:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
land orchards in front of Hill ciders
 
03:41:27.590 --> 03:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here in in vigorous support
 
03:41:29.630 --> 03:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
of what I consider to be a very
 
03:41:31.969 --> 03:41:31.979 align:start position:0%
marginally flawed bill
 
03:41:34.130 --> 03:41:34.140 align:start position:0%
um and I won't go through all the things
 
03:41:36.110 --> 03:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
I said before everything I said before
 
03:41:38.690 --> 03:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
about respect and civility
 
03:41:41.929 --> 03:41:41.939 align:start position:0%
we all stand for this bill as well
 
03:41:41.939 --> 03:41:42.530 align:start position:0%
we all stand for this bill as well
um

03:41:42.530 --> 03:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:44.809 --> 03:41:44.819 align:start position:0%
yet and I said this at the house side as
 
03:41:48.050 --> 03:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
well I think I think not just permanent
 
03:41:50.330 --> 03:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
but all Stan should should require
 
03:41:52.790 --> 03:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
permission now that's where that sign
 
03:41:55.790 --> 03:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
that we gave I gave you last time uh
 
03:41:58.790 --> 03:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's probably in the recycling now
 
03:41:58.800 --> 03:42:00.130 align:start position:0%
that's probably in the recycling now
um

03:42:00.130 --> 03:42:00.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:02.750 --> 03:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
it comes in because we're requiring
 
03:42:04.490 --> 03:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
permission anyway
 
03:42:06.590 --> 03:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
so the people come and ask permission
 
03:42:10.010 --> 03:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
for this stuff again as the our our
 
03:42:12.889 --> 03:42:12.899 align:start position:0%
usual experience is that people by
 
03:42:15.410 --> 03:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
Nature ask permission
 
03:42:17.210 --> 03:42:17.220 align:start position:0%
um and I will say that for what it's
 
03:42:19.309 --> 03:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
worth I haven't spoken to a single
 
03:42:22.250 --> 03:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
landowner who wasn't amazed that these
 
03:42:25.429 --> 03:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
bills were necessary that is to say that
 
03:42:29.690 --> 03:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
people were now Allowed by right to do
 
03:42:31.309 --> 03:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
these things
 
03:42:33.830 --> 03:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
um and and so I mean I I just the same
 
03:42:36.290 --> 03:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
thing I think people should have the
 
03:42:39.590 --> 03:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
facility facility civility to ask
 
03:42:41.510 --> 03:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
permission to do these things which is
 
03:42:43.550 --> 03:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
almost always given
 
03:42:45.950 --> 03:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
um and uh I didn't there's one other
 
03:42:47.809 --> 03:42:47.819 align:start position:0%
thing I didn't say that last time which
 
03:42:49.969 --> 03:42:49.979 align:start position:0%
is that when when people come to get
 
03:42:51.769 --> 03:42:51.779 align:start position:0%
written permission from us
 
03:42:54.290 --> 03:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
they now get a couple of pages they get
 
03:42:55.550 --> 03:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
they get
 
03:42:58.370 --> 03:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
um they get a black and white
 
03:43:00.650 --> 03:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
um aerial photo with the property lights
 
03:43:02.450 --> 03:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
and all our lands so they don't wander
 
03:43:05.809 --> 03:43:05.819 align:start position:0%
off to a a neighbor's land inadvertently
 
03:43:07.370 --> 03:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
um they if we have any particular
 
03:43:09.170 --> 03:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
requests or requirements for a
 
03:43:11.510 --> 03:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
particular piece of land that's for that
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
year that's detailed on that again
 
03:43:15.830 --> 03:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
they're very glad to have this
 
03:43:17.870 --> 03:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
interchange and I think this is part of
 
03:43:20.750 --> 03:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
the deal is trying to encourage that
 
03:43:23.330 --> 03:43:23.340 align:start position:0%
sort of interchange between the users of
 
03:43:24.830 --> 03:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
private property and the private
 
03:43:27.170 --> 03:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
property owners themselves so I support
 
03:43:29.570 --> 03:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
this I hope and I hope you will I
 
03:43:32.510 --> 03:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
support this bill with that one regret
 
03:43:34.429 --> 03:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
which is that I think it should be
 
03:43:34.439 --> 03:43:35.570 align:start position:0%
which is that I think it should be
required

03:43:35.570 --> 03:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
required
 
03:43:38.330 --> 03:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
for all of this
 
03:43:40.370 --> 03:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
thank you that's
 
03:43:43.670 --> 03:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
03:43:45.530 --> 03:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:43:49.910 --> 03:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:54.530 --> 03:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:57.530 --> 03:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
has written testimony
 
03:43:58.969 --> 03:43:58.979 align:start position:0%
is that what we passed out before all
 
03:44:03.349 --> 03:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
right thank you sb14 thank you yes Chris
 
03:44:06.410 --> 03:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
Fife with warehouser also the president
 
03:44:07.849 --> 03:44:07.859 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Timberland Owners
 
03:44:10.429 --> 03:44:10.439 align:start position:0%
Association and testifying on behalf of
 
03:44:13.429 --> 03:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
Weyerhaeuser I will skip most of the
 
03:44:15.889 --> 03:44:15.899 align:start position:0%
intro if it's in the written testimony
 
03:44:20.090 --> 03:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
and uh all you've all heard it already I
 
03:44:23.570 --> 03:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
I would just say specific to tree stands
 
03:44:26.389 --> 03:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
and sb15 that the requirements for
 
03:44:28.250 --> 03:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
labeling a tree stand with the name and
 
03:44:31.309 --> 03:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
contact information and a requirement
 
03:44:34.429 --> 03:44:34.439 align:start position:0%
for removal by January 1st our Common
 
03:44:36.229 --> 03:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
Sense steps I think respect the
 
03:44:37.910 --> 03:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
landowners rights
 
03:44:40.250 --> 03:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
and still maintain that tradition of
 
03:44:41.630 --> 03:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
hunting in the state
 
03:44:45.170 --> 03:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
I we see sb15 as an opportunity to
 
03:44:46.729 --> 03:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
improve communication between our
 
03:44:48.469 --> 03:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
Foresters and the owners of tree stands
 
03:44:50.450 --> 03:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
or observation blinds through that
 
03:44:52.130 --> 03:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
requirement for labeling with the name
 
03:44:54.830 --> 03:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
and contact information of the owner of
 
03:44:56.809 --> 03:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
the tree stand or observation blind in a
 
03:44:59.389 --> 03:44:59.399 align:start position:0%
clearly visible manner this is a
 
03:45:00.830 --> 03:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
requirement in other states where we
 
03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
have land Timberland that we manage it's
 
03:45:07.309 --> 03:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
not been an issue no one seems to have a
 
03:45:08.510 --> 03:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
problem with it and it certainly
 
03:45:11.809 --> 03:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
facilitates us being able to contact a
 
03:45:14.389 --> 03:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
hunter if we have an operation a harvest
 
03:45:16.790 --> 03:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
operation in the area often hunters will
 
03:45:18.670 --> 03:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
put these stands out ahead of the season
 
03:45:21.550 --> 03:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
they don't know our plans
 
03:45:21.560 --> 03:45:23.170 align:start position:0%
they don't know our plans
obviously

03:45:23.170 --> 03:45:23.180 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
03:45:25.969 --> 03:45:25.979 align:start position:0%
and we will come across them during the
 
03:45:27.889 --> 03:45:27.899 align:start position:0%
course of an operation Harvest operation
 
03:45:30.590 --> 03:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
and if we have no way to contact the
 
03:45:32.389 --> 03:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
owner or put in a position of either
 
03:45:36.650 --> 03:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
having to go around that tree which our
 
03:45:38.330 --> 03:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
business is not in growing trees to put
 
03:45:40.729 --> 03:45:40.739 align:start position:0%
stands on although we support that in
 
03:45:42.110 --> 03:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
the interim while those trees are
 
03:45:42.120 --> 03:45:43.090 align:start position:0%
the interim while those trees are
growing

03:45:43.090 --> 03:45:43.100 align:start position:0%
growing
 
03:45:46.790 --> 03:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
or we have to take the stand down
 
03:45:48.710 --> 03:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes they just aren't seen and
 
03:45:50.690 --> 03:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
stands get destroyed and this isn't an
 
03:45:52.490 --> 03:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
uncommon thing this is something that
 
03:45:54.769 --> 03:45:54.779 align:start position:0%
happens unfortunately and it's not
 
03:45:57.290 --> 03:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
something that our we as a company our
 
03:45:59.690 --> 03:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
Foresters or certainly a logger want to
 
03:46:01.490 --> 03:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
have happen is to destroy somebody's
 
03:46:03.530 --> 03:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
property I don't believe hunting stands
 
03:46:07.969 --> 03:46:07.979 align:start position:0%
are 39 a piece yet so Dave we recognize
 
03:46:10.190 --> 03:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
the value there
 
03:46:12.290 --> 03:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
so this really for us is a common sense
 
03:46:15.590 --> 03:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
way to increase that communication and
 
03:46:18.349 --> 03:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
to give us an opportunity to know who to
 
03:46:20.750 --> 03:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
contact if we have an issue as far as
 
03:46:24.889 --> 03:46:24.899 align:start position:0%
removal by January 1st this gives us an
 
03:46:27.710 --> 03:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
indication as a landowner that that is
 
03:46:29.710 --> 03:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
not a permanent fixture
 
03:46:32.090 --> 03:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
there certainly stands that I've come
 
03:46:35.030 --> 03:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
across in our Timberlands where it's
 
03:46:36.830 --> 03:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
obvious by the state of the stand that
 
03:46:39.710 --> 03:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
it's been out there for years and just
 
03:46:42.349 --> 03:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
left and I don't think that's respectful
 
03:46:44.570 --> 03:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
by the hunter I don't think it's
 
03:46:46.490 --> 03:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
something that a landowner should have
 
03:46:48.590 --> 03:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
to expect I think that at that point it
 
03:46:50.229 --> 03:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
becomes trash
 
03:46:52.910 --> 03:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
there certainly are cases that I just
 
03:46:55.070 --> 03:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
want to mention just like with game
 
03:46:58.309 --> 03:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
cameras if circumstances Beyond a
 
03:47:01.729 --> 03:47:01.739 align:start position:0%
hunter's control a big snowstorm in
 
03:47:03.950 --> 03:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
November that dumps two feet of snow and
 
03:47:05.330 --> 03:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
they can no longer get to the stand
 
03:47:07.729 --> 03:47:07.739 align:start position:0%
something like that happens they contact
 
03:47:07.739 --> 03:47:08.990 align:start position:0%
something like that happens they contact
us

03:47:08.990 --> 03:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:47:10.610 --> 03:47:10.620 align:start position:0%
that's all we're going to want we're
 
03:47:12.889 --> 03:47:12.899 align:start position:0%
finding we're going to say okay you know
 
03:47:14.630 --> 03:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
make sure you get out there and retrieve
 
03:47:17.150 --> 03:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
that when you can but we see that just
 
03:47:19.250 --> 03:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
as much as a sign of respect contacting
 
03:47:21.349 --> 03:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
us recognizing we don't want our roads
 
03:47:22.849 --> 03:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
and our infrastructure negatively
 
03:47:24.769 --> 03:47:24.779 align:start position:0%
impacted by someone trying to remove a
 
03:47:27.290 --> 03:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
tree stand so I know you can't really
 
03:47:30.110 --> 03:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
write that into legislation very easily
 
03:47:32.510 --> 03:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
but I want you to understand that that's
 
03:47:35.389 --> 03:47:35.399 align:start position:0%
our uh that that's our desire that's how
 
03:47:38.269 --> 03:47:38.279 align:start position:0%
we we interact with hunters and again
 
03:47:40.190 --> 03:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
just reiterate that we see Hunters as
 
03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
allies who's you know these users are
 
03:47:45.889 --> 03:47:45.899 align:start position:0%
their eyes and ears in the woods for us
 
03:47:49.190 --> 03:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
they're uh they are us really in most
 
03:47:51.830 --> 03:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
cases and so uh we certainly are trying
 
03:47:53.269 --> 03:47:53.279 align:start position:0%
to work together
 
03:47:56.210 --> 03:47:56.220 align:start position:0%
and with that I will just ask
 
03:47:58.670 --> 03:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
respectfully to you uh support this past
 
03:48:00.889 --> 03:48:00.899 align:start position:0%
this bill as presented and be willing to
 
03:48:02.510 --> 03:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
03:48:07.370 --> 03:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
thank you sir uh representative goalie
 
03:48:10.190 --> 03:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:48:10.200 --> 03:48:11.929 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
so

03:48:11.929 --> 03:48:11.939 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:48:14.269 --> 03:48:14.279 align:start position:0%
if a stand is put on a piece of property
 
03:48:16.190 --> 03:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
I know there's especially in the North
 
03:48:18.050 --> 03:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
Country some large
 
03:48:20.570 --> 03:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
tracks of land that are managed for
 
03:48:20.580 --> 03:48:21.650 align:start position:0%
tracks of land that are managed for
Timber

03:48:21.650 --> 03:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
Timber
 
03:48:23.929 --> 03:48:23.939 align:start position:0%
and that stands in the middle of a piece
 
03:48:25.309 --> 03:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
of property that you're getting ready to
 
03:48:25.319 --> 03:48:28.070 align:start position:0%
of property that you're getting ready to
harvest

03:48:28.070 --> 03:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:29.630 --> 03:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
now it
 
03:48:32.510 --> 03:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
ends up taking time away from you going
 
03:48:34.790 --> 03:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
forward with your project
 
03:48:37.130 --> 03:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
costing you probably some money going
 
03:48:38.750 --> 03:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
out there taking it down and now having
 
03:48:41.570 --> 03:48:41.580 align:start position:0%
to how is this somewhere until you get a
 
03:48:43.490 --> 03:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
hold of fishing game or
 
03:48:46.190 --> 03:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
find the right owner is it not costing
 
03:48:48.590 --> 03:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
you time and money if you don't know
 
03:48:50.269 --> 03:48:50.279 align:start position:0%
that it's out there when you come upon
 
03:48:51.590 --> 03:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
one as you get ready to harvest of
 
03:48:51.600 --> 03:48:52.969 align:start position:0%
one as you get ready to harvest of
course

03:48:52.969 --> 03:48:52.979 align:start position:0%
course
 
03:48:55.849 --> 03:48:55.859 align:start position:0%
doubt that's accurate yes you know any
 
03:48:57.590 --> 03:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
of those extras
 
03:49:00.769 --> 03:49:00.779 align:start position:0%
do just take time away from the real job
 
03:49:03.590 --> 03:49:03.600 align:start position:0%

03:49:07.610 --> 03:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:09.290 --> 03:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:49:15.050 --> 03:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:18.590 --> 03:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
the uh chair calls Jason stock
 
03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
supports the bill New Hampshire
 
03:49:36.969 --> 03:49:36.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:39.650 --> 03:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again for the record
 
03:49:41.750 --> 03:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
Jason stock executive director of the
 
03:49:42.889 --> 03:49:42.899 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Timberland Owners
 
03:49:45.349 --> 03:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
Association and
 
03:49:45.359 --> 03:49:47.450 align:start position:0%
Association and
um

03:49:47.450 --> 03:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:49.550 --> 03:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
come here today to speak in support of
 
03:49:53.090 --> 03:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
how of Senate Bill 15. similar to the
 
03:49:55.910 --> 03:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
similar to the camera Bill we we and as
 
03:49:58.010 --> 03:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
you heard in the prior testimony we
 
03:50:00.170 --> 03:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
believe this bill really represents what
 
03:50:03.410 --> 03:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
we think is just kind of common courtesy
 
03:50:04.849 --> 03:50:04.859 align:start position:0%
um if you're going to leave a tree stand
 
03:50:07.309 --> 03:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
up for any extended period of time and I
 
03:50:10.269 --> 03:50:10.279 align:start position:0%
I would qualify that as a year
 
03:50:13.190 --> 03:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
at that point you should you should ask
 
03:50:15.170 --> 03:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
that landowner or is it all right if I
 
03:50:17.929 --> 03:50:17.939 align:start position:0%
leave it up beyond that I think there
 
03:50:20.450 --> 03:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
are folks that that do that already but
 
03:50:22.429 --> 03:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
this codifies in law that that is in
 
03:50:24.170 --> 03:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
fact the case
 
03:50:26.809 --> 03:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
um the other piece of this is labeling
 
03:50:29.330 --> 03:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
um and labeling it I you'll go to any
 
03:50:32.630 --> 03:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
logging logging garage or forester's
 
03:50:35.809 --> 03:50:35.819 align:start position:0%
office in in November and in the corner
 
03:50:37.550 --> 03:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
it looks like a hunter's pick and save
 
03:50:40.250 --> 03:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
where there's a pile of stands game
 
03:50:40.260 --> 03:50:41.929 align:start position:0%
where there's a pile of stands game
cameras

03:50:41.929 --> 03:50:41.939 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
03:50:43.250 --> 03:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
um as we mentioned before I need that
 
03:50:46.130 --> 03:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
address okay that's right Fort Mountain
 
03:50:46.140 --> 03:50:48.590 align:start position:0%
address okay that's right Fort Mountain
companies

03:50:48.590 --> 03:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
companies
 
03:50:50.990 --> 03:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
so but you know they'll have the a pile
 
03:50:53.269 --> 03:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
of tree stands a pile of game cameras
 
03:50:56.030 --> 03:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
there and they'll say I don't want those
 
03:50:58.849 --> 03:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
but I don't know who to contact I don't
 
03:51:00.490 --> 03:51:00.500 align:start position:0%
have a name I don't have a phone number
 
03:51:03.349 --> 03:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
so again we think this is this works
 
03:51:06.229 --> 03:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
this works both ways I can now and and
 
03:51:08.030 --> 03:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
what will typically happen is they'll
 
03:51:10.670 --> 03:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
leave her business card on the on the
 
03:51:14.570 --> 03:51:14.580 align:start position:0%
tree stand or the game camera and
 
03:51:16.550 --> 03:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
there's no response so you're getting
 
03:51:19.370 --> 03:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
ready to do your Timber sale and all of
 
03:51:20.450 --> 03:51:20.460 align:start position:0%
a sudden
 
03:51:22.610 --> 03:51:22.620 align:start position:0%
you know we gotta we've gotta we can't
 
03:51:25.670 --> 03:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
cut this tree down and and with a stand
 
03:51:28.250 --> 03:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
on it so it does re does require or as
 
03:51:30.290 --> 03:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
representative goalie it does take time
 
03:51:31.969 --> 03:51:31.979 align:start position:0%
and energy and it's just kind of A
 
03:51:34.550 --> 03:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
disruption to the flow of things
 
03:51:34.560 --> 03:51:35.929 align:start position:0%
disruption to the flow of things
um

03:51:35.929 --> 03:51:35.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:39.110 --> 03:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
and so it the other point is you know we
 
03:51:40.910 --> 03:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
we looked at the to answer the question
 
03:51:44.330 --> 03:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
about permanent versus temporary we we
 
03:51:46.490 --> 03:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
looked at that in drafting this when we
 
03:51:47.870 --> 03:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
were with working with the Wildlife
 
03:51:49.849 --> 03:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
Federation and Farm Bureau and Fish and
 
03:51:54.349 --> 03:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
Game and you know we we looked at that
 
03:51:56.630 --> 03:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
and said look there are climbing stands
 
03:52:01.790 --> 03:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
now that I can walk into a woodlot climb
 
03:52:05.269 --> 03:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
up hunt and at the end of the day climb
 
03:52:07.370 --> 03:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
back down and go about my business and
 
03:52:08.990 --> 03:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
we said well that's you know that's not
 
03:52:11.809 --> 03:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
really a permanent stand and it's
 
03:52:14.090 --> 03:52:14.100 align:start position:0%
it's barely a temporary stand in that
 
03:52:15.769 --> 03:52:15.779 align:start position:0%
you're using it it's essentially a
 
03:52:17.269 --> 03:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
little platform that you stand on for
 
03:52:19.490 --> 03:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the day so what we did
 
03:52:22.130 --> 03:52:22.140 align:start position:0%
was we tried to craft a bill that that
 
03:52:24.469 --> 03:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
incorporated some common sense that says
 
03:52:25.670 --> 03:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
basically look if you're going to leave
 
03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
it there Beyond January one it starts
 
03:52:29.929 --> 03:52:29.939 align:start position:0%
looking it starts looking like a
 
03:52:31.550 --> 03:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
permanent structure you should get
 
03:52:31.560 --> 03:52:32.630 align:start position:0%
permanent structure you should get
permission

03:52:32.630 --> 03:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
permission
 
03:52:36.710 --> 03:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
and as as Mr Fife testified earlier it
 
03:52:39.830 --> 03:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
does it it does re you know it induces a
 
03:52:41.510 --> 03:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
dialogue with that landowner that land
 
03:52:44.030 --> 03:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
manager so for all those reasons we we
 
03:52:45.650 --> 03:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
come here today in full support of
 
03:52:48.290 --> 03:52:48.300 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 15 and I'd be happy to try
 
03:52:50.990 --> 03:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
 
03:52:53.269 --> 03:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
03:52:55.250 --> 03:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative pair
 
03:52:56.990 --> 03:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you excuse me thank you Mr
 
03:52:58.130 --> 03:52:58.140 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:52:58.140 --> 03:52:59.269 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

03:52:59.269 --> 03:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:53:02.690 --> 03:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
um on paragraph five in the uh bill that
 
03:53:05.510 --> 03:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
we have starting on line 14. uh it talks
 
03:53:09.410 --> 03:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
about portable stands and it says that
 
03:53:11.330 --> 03:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
um they can be erected without
 
03:53:15.170 --> 03:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
permission and all uh tree stands have
 
03:53:17.510 --> 03:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
to be removed by January 1st now was
 
03:53:19.130 --> 03:53:19.140 align:start position:0%
your definition of a portable or
 
03:53:22.429 --> 03:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
temporary stand what you just spoke of
 
03:53:24.349 --> 03:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
um the one that you come come in it's to
 
03:53:25.849 --> 03:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
get you a ladder to get up in the tree
 
03:53:27.830 --> 03:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
it goes up for the day and it comes down
 
03:53:31.309 --> 03:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
when you leave or which
 
03:53:33.590 --> 03:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
sounds like to me a temporary stand this
 
03:53:35.990 --> 03:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
sounds like a semi-permanent stand and I
 
03:53:37.370 --> 03:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
was wondering if something was Lost in
 
03:53:40.849 --> 03:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
Translation no they're they're both in
 
03:53:43.550 --> 03:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
in what I in what I would say is is that
 
03:53:45.769 --> 03:53:45.779 align:start position:0%
you have a climber that's that's a
 
03:53:49.490 --> 03:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
temporary stand I hunt with a a
 
03:53:53.450 --> 03:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
temporary stand on on my property that I
 
03:53:55.429 --> 03:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
will put up I'll leave it there for
 
03:53:57.769 --> 03:53:57.779 align:start position:0%
hunting season but at the end of the you
 
03:53:59.809 --> 03:53:59.819 align:start position:0%
know at the end of hunting season I take
 
03:54:03.110 --> 03:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
it down it doesn't it doesn't clip into
 
03:54:05.450 --> 03:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
the tree or you know damage the tree or
 
03:54:08.030 --> 03:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
harm the tree and so that's really in in
 
03:54:09.950 --> 03:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
Colonel Jordan can speak to this more
 
03:54:11.630 --> 03:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
but really when we look at the
 
03:54:13.250 --> 03:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
definition between permanent and
 
03:54:15.889 --> 03:54:15.899 align:start position:0%
temporary it really gets to what Senator
 
03:54:18.429 --> 03:54:18.439 align:start position:0%
Pearl said is are you kind of driving
 
03:54:21.830 --> 03:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
pins or nails or screws into it is it
 
03:54:24.410 --> 03:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
being affixed to that tree a climber is
 
03:54:27.790 --> 03:54:27.800 align:start position:0%
it a temporary stand but so is a
 
03:54:29.929 --> 03:54:29.939 align:start position:0%
non-climber that just kind of hangs on
 
03:54:33.410 --> 03:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
it in my case it has like a nylon strap
 
03:54:36.349 --> 03:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
ladder stands what's that ladder stance
 
03:54:39.110 --> 03:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
ladder stands same way it's you have a
 
03:54:41.090 --> 03:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
ladder and then a platform and that
 
03:54:44.750 --> 03:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
ladder actually has a has like a nylon
 
03:54:47.269 --> 03:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
strap that you ratchet on and it just
 
03:54:49.969 --> 03:54:49.979 align:start position:0%
kind of hugs the tree doesn't cut it
 
03:54:52.490 --> 03:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't drive into it but that's that's
 
03:54:55.189 --> 03:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
another form is a ladder stand mine's
 
03:54:56.870 --> 03:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
called a loggy bayou it's a little
 
03:54:58.910 --> 03:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
little stand that has a little rope
 
03:55:01.490 --> 03:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
nylon rope that just ties onto the back
 
03:55:03.349 --> 03:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
of the stand and
 
03:55:07.370 --> 03:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
that's it but I leave it up for multiple
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
months during deer season
 
03:55:12.710 --> 03:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up I'm not sure if
 
03:55:13.910 --> 03:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
there's a question for you and maybe
 
03:55:16.010 --> 03:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
it's covered in the bill that I and I
 
03:55:17.570 --> 03:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
didn't catch it but even one of these if
 
03:55:19.309 --> 03:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
it's going to be up for longer than
 
03:55:22.130 --> 03:55:22.140 align:start position:0%
today's Hunting Expedition then it
 
03:55:23.750 --> 03:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
should be should be labeled the same as
 
03:55:25.490 --> 03:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
the other ones yeah they all should be
 
03:55:27.950 --> 03:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
labeled in in our opinion that's what we
 
03:55:30.410 --> 03:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
read this bill as is you would require a
 
03:55:33.050 --> 03:55:33.060 align:start position:0%
label for all of them
 
03:55:35.210 --> 03:55:35.220 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:55:38.450 --> 03:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
03:55:41.990 --> 03:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you testimony today uh
 
03:55:52.370 --> 03:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:54.710 --> 03:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Diane Richardson still from the
 
03:55:57.229 --> 03:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
Lake Sunapee area and
 
03:55:59.030 --> 03:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
um I actually
 
03:56:01.849 --> 03:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
support this bill for the most part
 
03:56:04.550 --> 03:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
um my only caveat is the labeling with
 
03:56:07.309 --> 03:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
the name on it because that's putting a
 
03:56:09.590 --> 03:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
Target on people's backs
 
03:56:11.870 --> 03:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
phone number fine hunting license fine
 
03:56:15.370 --> 03:56:15.380 align:start position:0%
putting your name on it every year I see
 
03:56:19.670 --> 03:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
many many posts where people have been
 
03:56:22.450 --> 03:56:22.460 align:start position:0%
had their tree stands targeted by
 
03:56:25.910 --> 03:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
anti-hunters or jealous hunters or
 
03:56:29.050 --> 03:56:29.060 align:start position:0%
people that want that spot or something
 
03:56:32.570 --> 03:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
and they'll have their stands
 
03:56:36.349 --> 03:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh vandalized or stolen or something and
 
03:56:38.269 --> 03:56:38.279 align:start position:0%
I think putting a name on it is just
 
03:56:40.429 --> 03:56:40.439 align:start position:0%
asking for more trouble than we already
 
03:56:40.439 --> 03:56:41.750 align:start position:0%
asking for more trouble than we already
have

03:56:41.750 --> 03:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:56:43.790 --> 03:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
and that's it
 
03:56:47.150 --> 03:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:48.650 --> 03:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:56:48.660 --> 03:56:51.650 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
today

03:56:51.650 --> 03:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:04.550 --> 03:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:07.250 --> 03:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
I'm Jenny christenton and my husband and
 
03:57:07.260 --> 03:57:08.389 align:start position:0%
I'm Jenny christenton and my husband and
I

03:57:08.389 --> 03:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:57:11.090 --> 03:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
um my husband Tom and I own a 700 acre
 
03:57:13.729 --> 03:57:13.739 align:start position:0%
Tree Farm in both lineborough and
 
03:57:15.950 --> 03:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
Greenfield can you both can you all hear
 
03:57:19.250 --> 03:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
me okay thank you our land has been open
 
03:57:22.429 --> 03:57:22.439 align:start position:0%
to hunting since 1972.
 
03:57:24.710 --> 03:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
we know a lot of the hunters that have
 
03:57:26.809 --> 03:57:26.819 align:start position:0%
come by over the years but we don't know
 
03:57:29.870 --> 03:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
all of them we manage our tree farm for
 
03:57:32.830 --> 03:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
Timber wildlife and Recreation in fact
 
03:57:35.689 --> 03:57:35.699 align:start position:0%
our land was all Woods in the beginning
 
03:57:37.969 --> 03:57:37.979 align:start position:0%
and we've created Wildlife openings
 
03:57:40.490 --> 03:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
which actually has benefited the hunters
 
03:57:43.550 --> 03:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
because we have more wildlife
 
03:57:46.990 --> 03:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
um we don't know all of the hunters
 
03:57:49.910 --> 03:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
we ask is this courtesy for the ones
 
03:57:51.710 --> 03:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
that we know could you tell us where the
 
03:57:53.809 --> 03:57:53.819 align:start position:0%
tree stands are and there's a couple
 
03:57:55.550 --> 03:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
reasons for this
 
03:57:57.950 --> 03:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
this is our backyard we have a lot of
 
03:58:00.769 --> 03:58:00.779 align:start position:0%
hunt of hikers that come through we'd
 
03:58:02.689 --> 03:58:02.699 align:start position:0%
like the hunters to know exactly where
 
03:58:06.110 --> 03:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
are the hikers so we can see where
 
03:58:08.030 --> 03:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to put the stand is it
 
03:58:10.550 --> 03:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
going to be safe for the hikers and also
 
03:58:14.030 --> 03:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
in case there are more than one Hunter
 
03:58:16.490 --> 03:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
will they put their deer stands far
 
03:58:20.990 --> 03:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
enough apart so it it's um better for
 
03:58:21.000 --> 03:58:22.689 align:start position:0%
enough apart so it it's um better for
them

03:58:22.689 --> 03:58:22.699 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:58:25.610 --> 03:58:25.620 align:start position:0%
better for them
 
03:58:28.610 --> 03:58:28.620 align:start position:0%
you were mentioning how deer stands are
 
03:58:31.309 --> 03:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
installed we've come across old deer
 
03:58:33.349 --> 03:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
stands that have been nailed into the
 
03:58:35.809 --> 03:58:35.819 align:start position:0%
trees and that's basically rule in that
 
03:58:38.150 --> 03:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
whole section of the tree some of the
 
03:58:40.790 --> 03:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
deer stands are put in with straps
 
03:58:43.250 --> 03:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
if the deer stand is abandoned those
 
03:58:46.130 --> 03:58:46.140 align:start position:0%
straps constrict the tray the tree goes
 
03:58:47.809 --> 03:58:47.819 align:start position:0%
around them and again we've lose the
 
03:58:50.330 --> 03:58:50.340 align:start position:0%
value of that wood
 
03:58:50.340 --> 03:58:52.250 align:start position:0%
value of that wood
um

03:58:52.250 --> 03:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:55.130 --> 03:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
one reason is because of the hikers but
 
03:58:57.950 --> 03:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
also if we have a harvest cut we'd like
 
03:59:01.010 --> 03:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
to be able to know who has the stand so
 
03:59:02.870 --> 03:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
we can take it down because some of them
 
03:59:04.670 --> 03:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
will just leave them there a couple
 
03:59:07.849 --> 03:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
years ago we had a tree stand in a
 
03:59:10.969 --> 03:59:10.979 align:start position:0%
harvest area Tom went out and cut the
 
03:59:12.110 --> 03:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
thing off
 
03:59:15.170 --> 03:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
and fell while he was doing it he got up
 
03:59:17.450 --> 03:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
shaken and bruised but it could have
 
03:59:19.010 --> 03:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
been worse
 
03:59:20.990 --> 03:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
it would have been so much easier if
 
03:59:22.969 --> 03:59:22.979 align:start position:0%
there was a name on the stand he could
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
have called him up and said please will
 
03:59:28.010 --> 03:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
you come and remove the stand
 
03:59:28.020 --> 03:59:29.210 align:start position:0%
you come and remove the stand
um

03:59:29.210 --> 03:59:29.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:32.150 --> 03:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
we are like I said open to hunting we
 
03:59:34.070 --> 03:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to have to if there are
 
03:59:36.229 --> 03:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
problems take our land out of hunting
 
03:59:38.689 --> 03:59:38.699 align:start position:0%
because we do understand that the
 
03:59:41.630 --> 03:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
hunters are man helping to manage the
 
03:59:43.809 --> 03:59:43.819 align:start position:0%
wildlife that's out there
 
03:59:46.429 --> 03:59:46.439 align:start position:0%
I do have some written testimony and
 
03:59:48.349 --> 03:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
just a quick thing we were not able to
 
03:59:51.290 --> 03:59:51.300 align:start position:0%
get to the um hearing for this morning
 
03:59:53.809 --> 03:59:53.819 align:start position:0%
for game cameras
 
03:59:57.050 --> 03:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
our tree farm is our backyard I really
 
04:00:00.469 --> 04:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
don't want to have deer cameras out
 
04:00:02.750 --> 04:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
there okay that can be taking pictures
 
04:00:05.110 --> 04:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
of me at any time or being broadcast
 
04:00:08.570 --> 04:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
somewhere okay I'm sure none of you
 
04:00:10.309 --> 04:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
people would like a camera in your
 
04:00:13.010 --> 04:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
backyard taking pictures of you
 
04:00:15.830 --> 04:00:15.840 align:start position:0%

04:00:18.889 --> 04:00:18.899 align:start position:0%
me to testify here again I'm supporting

the chair calls Robert Johnson II
 
04:00:50.460 --> 04:00:56.570 align:start position:0%
the chair calls Robert Johnson II
foreign

04:00:56.570 --> 04:00:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:58.790 --> 04:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the

Johnson representing the New Hampshire
 
04:01:03.769 --> 04:01:03.779 align:start position:0%
fambio as the federation's policy
 
04:01:05.990 --> 04:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
director and speaking in support of
 
04:01:09.710 --> 04:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 15. again we did work with
 
04:01:11.210 --> 04:01:11.220 align:start position:0%
as you've heard with the Timberland
 
04:01:13.130 --> 04:01:13.140 align:start position:0%
owners Wildlife Federation and fishing
 
04:01:16.729 --> 04:01:16.739 align:start position:0%
game on this this bill as well and I
 
04:01:18.650 --> 04:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
think most of what is what I had
 
04:01:20.330 --> 04:01:20.340 align:start position:0%
anticipated saying has been said I'll
 
04:01:21.830 --> 04:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
just touch on two items that I know
 
04:01:23.689 --> 04:01:23.699 align:start position:0%
there have been some questions on and
 
04:01:25.490 --> 04:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
and I guess the first is the the
 
04:01:28.550 --> 04:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
labeling piece it's uh something that a
 
04:01:31.250 --> 04:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
strong strong piece of the bill that
 
04:01:33.889 --> 04:01:33.899 align:start position:0%
that we support we find that many of our
 
04:01:35.630 --> 04:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
members already think that it's a
 
04:01:38.330 --> 04:01:38.340 align:start position:0%
requirement is again for the reasons
 
04:01:40.070 --> 04:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
that have been mentioned just the
 
04:01:42.410 --> 04:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
ability to to contact somebody to know
 
04:01:45.170 --> 04:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
whose it is or to return it and as far
 
04:01:47.269 --> 04:01:47.279 align:start position:0%
as the information the the specific
 
04:01:50.330 --> 04:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
requirement on the labeling we would
 
04:01:53.330 --> 04:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
want a just a phone number would be
 
04:01:55.490 --> 04:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
concerning to us because we you know if
 
04:01:57.410 --> 04:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
we can somebody go to number rocking
 
04:01:58.790 --> 04:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
ring and ring and ring you don't get it
 
04:02:00.530 --> 04:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
I would prefer to have it if it's not
 
04:02:02.510 --> 04:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
the name the the hunting license ID so
 
04:02:03.889 --> 04:02:03.899 align:start position:0%
then we can fishing game could be
 
04:02:05.870 --> 04:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
contacted and then we can get a name
 
04:02:07.070 --> 04:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
um that would be good and then the
 
04:02:09.410 --> 04:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
second piece I'll touch on is uh where
 
04:02:11.210 --> 04:02:11.220 align:start position:0%
there have been questions is the the the
 
04:02:13.370 --> 04:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
date the stand
 
04:02:15.110 --> 04:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
um to come down
 
04:02:17.570 --> 04:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
um the date itself is not important to
 
04:02:19.490 --> 04:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
us the important piece that there is a
 
04:02:21.590 --> 04:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
date when there's a check-in when the
 
04:02:24.469 --> 04:02:24.479 align:start position:0%
the stand is removed by so that that if
 
04:02:26.570 --> 04:02:26.580 align:start position:0%
uh um you know if they've checked in and
 
04:02:27.950 --> 04:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
they've already get in Orlando it gives
 
04:02:29.269 --> 04:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
permission it's up to your own that's
 
04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
fine but we want that check in so that
 
04:02:33.950 --> 04:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
we can be sure that the stands are are
 
04:02:37.429 --> 04:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
removed um you know on a what again
 
04:02:38.990 --> 04:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
whatever that date may be whether it's
 
04:02:41.510 --> 04:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
March 15th April 1st January 1st but
 
04:02:43.250 --> 04:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
again the date is important so that
 
04:02:46.490 --> 04:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
there's that uh that dialogue in it it
 
04:02:47.809 --> 04:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
doesn't become a permanent fixture on
 
04:02:49.490 --> 04:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
the property and I'll leave my testimony
 
04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
at that thank you again for your time
 
04:02:55.550 --> 04:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:57.290 --> 04:02:57.300 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
04:02:58.910 --> 04:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr Sharon and thank you for
 
04:03:01.490 --> 04:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question sorry to be confused
 
04:03:04.969 --> 04:03:04.979 align:start position:0%
uh you said you don't uh you you don't
 
04:03:07.670 --> 04:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
have a specific uh requirement for a
 
04:03:11.689 --> 04:03:11.699 align:start position:0%
date but you you said check in so let me
 
04:03:13.250 --> 04:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
know what you mean by that yeah well the
 
04:03:15.349 --> 04:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
the Bill calls for the the stands be
 
04:03:18.410 --> 04:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
removed by January 1. if if that date
 
04:03:19.790 --> 04:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
were to change I know there's been some
 
04:03:21.650 --> 04:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
voice I'm concern about January 1 being
 
04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
winter if it were a different time of
 
04:03:26.210 --> 04:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
the year uh in the in the spring or the
 
04:03:28.250 --> 04:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
fall whenever we just think having a
 
04:03:30.769 --> 04:03:30.779 align:start position:0%
date is important when there is that
 
04:03:32.689 --> 04:03:32.699 align:start position:0%
that that check-in that when that
 
04:03:37.910 --> 04:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:40.130 --> 04:03:40.140 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
04:03:42.830 --> 04:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative goalie
 
04:03:44.150 --> 04:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
I just want to follow up on that
 
04:03:46.130 --> 04:03:46.140 align:start position:0%
question so
 
04:03:47.750 --> 04:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is with the check-in
 
04:03:49.969 --> 04:03:49.979 align:start position:0%
date you don't want them permanent
 
04:03:54.410 --> 04:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:56.389 --> 04:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:03:59.090 --> 04:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
any further questions seeing none thank
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:06.000 --> 04:04:07.370 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:04:07.370 --> 04:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:04:10.370 --> 04:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the commission uh
 
04:04:12.950 --> 04:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to give my
 
04:04:16.309 --> 04:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
comments I have been a little confused
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
and my biggest concern is that with tree
 
04:04:22.250 --> 04:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
stands I don't mind them but I do want
 
04:04:25.610 --> 04:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
people to ask permission because I want
 
04:04:28.490 --> 04:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
to specify that they can only use
 
04:04:32.330 --> 04:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
portable tree stands and the reason for
 
04:04:34.910 --> 04:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
that is a number of years ago I had a
 
04:04:37.130 --> 04:04:37.140 align:start position:0%
beautiful red oak on my property I've
 
04:04:38.990 --> 04:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
got a lot of red oak
 
04:04:41.570 --> 04:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
and this tree was probably as big as a
 
04:04:44.750 --> 04:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
55 gallon drum in diameter
 
04:04:48.650 --> 04:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't a limb for 25 feet or more
 
04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
which means it would grade the highest
 
04:04:54.769 --> 04:04:54.779 align:start position:0%
like veneer that type of thing
 
04:04:57.910 --> 04:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
and someone came in and they had these
 
04:04:59.990 --> 04:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
screw steps
 
04:05:02.929 --> 04:05:02.939 align:start position:0%
they're a lag thread it's about three
 
04:05:04.849 --> 04:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
inches long that they screw into the
 
04:05:07.250 --> 04:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
tree and then there's a little saddle
 
04:05:10.010 --> 04:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
like put to feed into climb them
 
04:05:13.849 --> 04:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
so you know they ruined a lot of money
 
04:05:15.290 --> 04:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
there ask any of the folks in the
 
04:05:15.300 --> 04:05:16.550 align:start position:0%
there ask any of the folks in the
chemistry

04:05:16.550 --> 04:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
chemistry
 
04:05:20.210 --> 04:05:20.220 align:start position:0%
and then another similar deal where I
 
04:05:22.849 --> 04:05:22.859 align:start position:0%
was helping a friend and
 
04:05:25.130 --> 04:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
we cut a bunch of Pine and brought it to
 
04:05:26.990 --> 04:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
was a small Mill wasn't one of the big
 
04:05:30.050 --> 04:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
commercial ones and I know nowadays they
 
04:05:32.630 --> 04:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
have magnets or whatever to scan the log
 
04:05:35.090 --> 04:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
before they saw it but some of the
 
04:05:36.950 --> 04:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
smaller Mills I don't think are equipped
 
04:05:39.769 --> 04:05:39.779 align:start position:0%
with that and so when they start sawing
 
04:05:42.889 --> 04:05:42.899 align:start position:0%
the board a lot of these spikes they
 
04:05:44.870 --> 04:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
used to scrap lumbar two by fours
 
04:05:46.969 --> 04:05:46.979 align:start position:0%
whatever Spike them to the tree to get
 
04:05:49.910 --> 04:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
up where they want to sit and they just
 
04:05:51.229 --> 04:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
left them like that the wood
 
04:05:53.689 --> 04:05:53.699 align:start position:0%
deteriorates over a period of time the
 
04:05:56.750 --> 04:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
back Grows Right Out Over the Spike
 
04:05:59.870 --> 04:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
heads so you can't detect them and when
 
04:06:01.670 --> 04:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
you take those to The Sawmill and they
 
04:06:04.130 --> 04:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
start souring it and it wrecks the teeth
 
04:06:06.889 --> 04:06:06.899 align:start position:0%
you have to pay for that
 
04:06:10.010 --> 04:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
so I guess I just wanted to make sure
 
04:06:14.809 --> 04:06:14.819 align:start position:0%
that you know that's in the new proposal
 
04:06:17.510 --> 04:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
right or was it something that's already
 
04:06:19.969 --> 04:06:19.979 align:start position:0%
been in the past so I can let you know
 
04:06:22.130 --> 04:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
that under current law and in fact
 
04:06:25.729 --> 04:06:25.739 align:start position:0%
you'll see it in item one no person
 
04:06:28.250 --> 04:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
shall erect build or use a tree stand or
 
04:06:30.050 --> 04:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
observation blind on land of another
 
04:06:32.090 --> 04:06:32.100 align:start position:0%
person that damages or destroys a tree
 
04:06:33.950 --> 04:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
by inserting into the tree any metallic
 
04:06:36.349 --> 04:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
ceramic or other object used as part of
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
a land or observation ladder or
 
04:06:40.729 --> 04:06:40.739 align:start position:0%
observation deck without Express written
 
04:06:42.170 --> 04:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
permission from the property owner or
 
04:06:43.849 --> 04:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
designee is already in the lawn it's
 
04:06:47.469 --> 04:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
been in the law for at least 50 years
 
04:06:51.349 --> 04:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
so so that the situation you describe is
 
04:06:54.050 --> 04:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
already illegal and this bill is just
 
04:06:56.090 --> 04:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
adding in some new sections to deal with
 
04:06:57.950 --> 04:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
the portable type that don't puncture
 
04:06:59.090 --> 04:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
the tree
 
04:06:59.100 --> 04:07:00.229 align:start position:0%
the tree
okay

04:07:00.229 --> 04:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:07:04.550 --> 04:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
so I still I guess I'm still in favor of
 
04:07:06.889 --> 04:07:06.899 align:start position:0%
it because I like the idea asking
 
04:07:08.809 --> 04:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
because not everybody knows the law or
 
04:07:10.729 --> 04:07:10.739 align:start position:0%
bothers to even look them up
 
04:07:13.250 --> 04:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
and so I can say yes you can put a tree
 
04:07:16.610 --> 04:07:16.620 align:start position:0%
stand up but it's going to be portable
 
04:07:18.889 --> 04:07:18.899 align:start position:0%
and that would be my biggest thing for
 
04:07:23.510 --> 04:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:25.429 --> 04:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
04:07:27.290 --> 04:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
and I'll call the last person Kevin
 
04:07:27.300 --> 04:07:28.670 align:start position:0%
and I'll call the last person Kevin
Jordan

04:07:28.670 --> 04:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
Jordan
 
04:07:37.969 --> 04:07:37.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:39.410 --> 04:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
sitting away in the back like you don't
 
04:07:42.950 --> 04:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:44.990 --> 04:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you again for having me
 
04:07:45.000 --> 04:07:45.769 align:start position:0%
thank you again for having me
um

04:07:45.769 --> 04:07:45.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
just quickly it was it was we worked on
 
04:07:50.030 --> 04:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
this the same time we did the camera
 
04:07:51.410 --> 04:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
bill because again it was a major
 
04:07:53.450 --> 04:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
complaint of a lot of the landowners
 
04:07:55.070 --> 04:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
that we were getting calls on and they
 
04:07:56.450 --> 04:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
were this one's a little different
 
04:07:58.910 --> 04:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
because there is a belief among amongst
 
04:08:01.790 --> 04:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
the sportsmen and women they have to put
 
04:08:03.889 --> 04:08:03.899 align:start position:0%
their name on their tree stands
 
04:08:05.750 --> 04:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
um I know I'm not sure where that comes
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
from but there's a lot of people that
 
04:08:09.110 --> 04:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
think they have to we we would ask the
 
04:08:11.689 --> 04:08:11.699 align:start position:0%
only change in this you'd be correct is
 
04:08:15.530 --> 04:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
uh we are asking for names and contact
 
04:08:18.110 --> 04:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
information to be put on we talked this
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
morning at the camera Bill about maybe
 
04:08:21.710 --> 04:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
using a hunting license I don't I don't
 
04:08:23.450 --> 04:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
object to that I did have a landowner
 
04:08:26.269 --> 04:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
come up to me made a very good point he
 
04:08:27.590 --> 04:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
said you know sometimes we want to
 
04:08:29.330 --> 04:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
handle that on our own
 
04:08:31.670 --> 04:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
without getting law enforcement involved
 
04:08:33.410 --> 04:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
because they feel like you know and I
 
04:08:35.330 --> 04:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
get that I you don't want to anger the
 
04:08:37.010 --> 04:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
hunter thinking Nicole game a game
 
04:08:38.630 --> 04:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
warden so they said the name would be
 
04:08:40.429 --> 04:08:40.439 align:start position:0%
helpful to them because then they'd pick
 
04:08:41.870 --> 04:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
the phone up and call Kevin Jordan and
 
04:08:44.269 --> 04:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
say you got to move your stand I don't
 
04:08:47.450 --> 04:08:47.460 align:start position:0%
object to that I don't fear the name
 
04:08:49.969 --> 04:08:49.979 align:start position:0%
like some do because I again we have
 
04:08:52.070 --> 04:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
names on a lot of things and I've not
 
04:08:54.830 --> 04:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
had a lot of issues with that so
 
04:08:57.410 --> 04:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
um we all know if you don't know I'm
 
04:08:58.729 --> 04:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
going to tell you people leave their
 
04:09:01.130 --> 04:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
stands out to mark their territory so
 
04:09:03.410 --> 04:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
they have a good spot like I do I kill a
 
04:09:05.389 --> 04:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
buck I harvest a buck almost every year
 
04:09:07.250 --> 04:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
from the same piece of property of a
 
04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
very gracious landowner and again I want
 
04:09:11.389 --> 04:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
to thank the landowners here for
 
04:09:14.330 --> 04:09:14.340 align:start position:0%
allowing guys like me to hunt uh he
 
04:09:17.030 --> 04:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
knows I'm there and and I worry every
 
04:09:19.070 --> 04:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
year right after I get my dear I go
 
04:09:20.630 --> 04:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
right back in and get my stand I have a
 
04:09:22.490 --> 04:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
climber much like Jason described to you
 
04:09:24.889 --> 04:09:24.899 align:start position:0%
I use the same type of climber mine's a
 
04:09:26.450 --> 04:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
little fancier because I like to fall
 
04:09:28.309 --> 04:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
into a very deep sleep when I'm sitting
 
04:09:30.469 --> 04:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
in it and it keeps me alive because as I
 
04:09:32.210 --> 04:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
tip over it I hit the rail and it
 
04:09:34.790 --> 04:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
straightens me back up I do manage on
 
04:09:36.769 --> 04:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
occasion to get a buck and I go in the
 
04:09:39.170 --> 04:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
next day and remove my stand I
 
04:09:41.469 --> 04:09:41.479 align:start position:0%
understand the thought process in places
 
04:09:44.090 --> 04:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
down here where there's higher hunting
 
04:09:45.769 --> 04:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
pressure you leave your standout it kind
 
04:09:47.469 --> 04:09:47.479 align:start position:0%
of tells other Hunters that's my spot
 
04:09:49.969 --> 04:09:49.979 align:start position:0%
this so I thought of that when we wrote
 
04:09:51.410 --> 04:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
that and I thought we can put a
 
04:09:52.969 --> 04:09:52.979 align:start position:0%
provision in here that allows that but
 
04:09:54.170 --> 04:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
you just gotta have permission from the
 
04:09:55.790 --> 04:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
landowner to do it so I didn't want to
 
04:09:57.769 --> 04:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
eliminate that so you can go to a
 
04:09:59.630 --> 04:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
landowner and all of this would go by
 
04:10:01.070 --> 04:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
the wayside if he gives you permission
 
04:10:03.290 --> 04:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
to leave it there permanent the
 
04:10:04.429 --> 04:10:04.439 align:start position:0%
difference between a permanent and a
 
04:10:07.370 --> 04:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
climber by by fishing aimlar a permanent
 
04:10:09.469 --> 04:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
stand would be any stand that causes any
 
04:10:12.290 --> 04:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
damage to a tree so anytime you insert
 
04:10:14.630 --> 04:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
anything into a tree it whether it's a
 
04:10:17.330 --> 04:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
peg a hanger to hang the stand on
 
04:10:19.130 --> 04:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
anything that goes into the tree or if
 
04:10:22.910 --> 04:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
you cut branches or or trees down to
 
04:10:24.410 --> 04:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
make a clear shot which a lot of people
 
04:10:26.809 --> 04:10:26.819 align:start position:0%
do that falls under permanent tree stand
 
04:10:29.150 --> 04:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
and requires written landowner
 
04:10:30.950 --> 04:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
permission for that that's been in the
 
04:10:32.630 --> 04:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
law for years that's never changed the
 
04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
slaw doesn't change that this law is
 
04:10:37.910 --> 04:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
requiring you to put your names on them
 
04:10:40.309 --> 04:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
and then remove them unless the
 
04:10:42.050 --> 04:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
landowner gives you permission to leave
 
04:10:44.450 --> 04:10:44.460 align:start position:0%
it so we we kind of again I tried to
 
04:10:46.910 --> 04:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
balance the rights of the Hunter and the
 
04:10:48.769 --> 04:10:48.779 align:start position:0%
rights of the landowner so we we left a
 
04:10:49.969 --> 04:10:49.979 align:start position:0%
little caveat so if you've got a
 
04:10:51.050 --> 04:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
landowner that doesn't care if you leave
 
04:10:52.490 --> 04:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
your stand up all year so you can mark
 
04:10:54.889 --> 04:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
your territory that's fine if you do
 
04:10:56.210 --> 04:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
have a landowner it gives them the
 
04:10:58.070 --> 04:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
option to move it out the last thing I
 
04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to address and again it's a
 
04:11:02.450 --> 04:11:02.460 align:start position:0%
courtesy and respect that's all it is
 
04:11:04.969 --> 04:11:04.979 align:start position:0%
and we try to teach it I'm trying to do
 
04:11:07.130 --> 04:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
it when we create laws so that hunters
 
04:11:08.929 --> 04:11:08.939 align:start position:0%
get into that mindset that this is not
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
your god-given right someone owns this
 
04:11:12.769 --> 04:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
property and they're paying for it and
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
they're gracious enough to let us use it
 
04:11:16.250 --> 04:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
and we want to protect that and preserve
 
04:11:18.710 --> 04:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
it and respect it
 
04:11:18.720 --> 04:11:19.370 align:start position:0%
it and respect it
um

04:11:19.370 --> 04:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:21.469 --> 04:11:21.479 align:start position:0%
the last thing is
 
04:11:21.479 --> 04:11:22.670 align:start position:0%
the last thing is
um

04:11:22.670 --> 04:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:24.530 --> 04:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
God this is happening to me more often
 
04:11:24.540 --> 04:11:26.269 align:start position:0%
God this is happening to me more often
than

04:11:26.269 --> 04:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:11:28.910 --> 04:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh then oh the date excuse me the date
 
04:11:31.130 --> 04:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
so Chairman's Blaine and I spoke briefly
 
04:11:33.769 --> 04:11:33.779 align:start position:0%
uh today about the date why January 1.
 
04:11:35.689 --> 04:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
we picked January 1 because it was just
 
04:11:38.570 --> 04:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
the beginning of a new year number one
 
04:11:40.729 --> 04:11:40.739 align:start position:0%
um he brought up a a valid point you
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
know I don't want people leaving them
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
out there till January 1 and climbing
 
04:11:45.229 --> 04:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
them up when they're froze climbing up
 
04:11:46.490 --> 04:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
there when they're frozen and falling
 
04:11:48.170 --> 04:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
out of them that's a good point I
 
04:11:50.870 --> 04:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
understand that so he suggested
 
04:11:52.849 --> 04:11:52.859 align:start position:0%
um having a deadline in the spring which
 
04:11:54.769 --> 04:11:54.779 align:start position:0%
I'm good with that the only concern I
 
04:11:57.110 --> 04:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
would have with that and Jason and his
 
04:11:59.510 --> 04:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
his group could speak better to this is
 
04:12:01.189 --> 04:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of those cuts happen in the
 
04:12:01.199 --> 04:12:02.150 align:start position:0%
a lot of those cuts happen in the
wintertime

04:12:02.150 --> 04:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
wintertime
 
04:12:04.010 --> 04:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the cuts on the major land
 
04:12:05.389 --> 04:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
happen in the winter when the ground's
 
04:12:08.870 --> 04:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
frozen so that would not allow that
 
04:12:11.090 --> 04:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
would not be conducive to getting those
 
04:12:12.590 --> 04:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
stands out because that's really why
 
04:12:15.590 --> 04:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
we're doing this is for that so although
 
04:12:17.750 --> 04:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
you could argue I guess that the name is
 
04:12:19.250 --> 04:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
on it they could see the name if
 
04:12:20.929 --> 04:12:20.939 align:start position:0%
everybody's applied you know following
 
04:12:22.250 --> 04:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
the law and you could call him out and
 
04:12:24.229 --> 04:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
and say get your tree stand off because
 
04:12:25.370 --> 04:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
we're going to cut it but that would be
 
04:12:27.769 --> 04:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
my little concern I do agree a cutoff
 
04:12:30.110 --> 04:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
date's important it doesn't I'm not as
 
04:12:32.450 --> 04:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
sold on whatever date that is but I
 
04:12:33.950 --> 04:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
would ask you to consider that a lot of
 
04:12:36.290 --> 04:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
these properties are cut in the winter
 
04:12:38.689 --> 04:12:38.699 align:start position:0%
months when it's frozen so
 
04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh the other concern it was raised and
 
04:12:42.830 --> 04:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
this is why this came up last year as I
 
04:12:44.150 --> 04:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
had a landowner who was concerned about
 
04:12:46.490 --> 04:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
liability his concern was we have a
 
04:12:48.050 --> 04:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
permanent stand up I don't know whose it
 
04:12:50.269 --> 04:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
is and if someone climbs up in that tree
 
04:12:52.849 --> 04:12:52.859 align:start position:0%
stand and and falls out of it I'm going
 
04:12:55.309 --> 04:12:55.319 align:start position:0%
to be held liable for that so there's
 
04:12:57.229 --> 04:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
some truth to that and some not so
 
04:12:59.389 --> 04:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
accurate truth to that I was in my
 
04:13:01.389 --> 04:13:01.399 align:start position:0%
office two days ago I was working
 
04:13:04.729 --> 04:13:04.739 align:start position:0%
diligently like I always do I turned
 
04:13:06.229 --> 04:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
around this is a true story I turned
 
04:13:08.150 --> 04:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
around to face a U.S attorney assistant
 
04:13:10.010 --> 04:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
standing there with paperwork in his
 
04:13:11.510 --> 04:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
hand now I in I've been in this business
 
04:13:14.389 --> 04:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
a long time I've been sued I believe six
 
04:13:15.889 --> 04:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
times total
 
04:13:18.349 --> 04:13:18.359 align:start position:0%
and luckily always followed the law you
 
04:13:19.670 --> 04:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
get sued for following the law that's
 
04:13:21.650 --> 04:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
the best way to get sued because you're
 
04:13:23.510 --> 04:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
protected so and this is what this
 
04:13:25.130 --> 04:13:25.140 align:start position:0%
lawsuit is so I was served with a
 
04:13:27.050 --> 04:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
lawsuit because I followed the law I
 
04:13:29.389 --> 04:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't allow a guide to become a guide
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
because he was a convicted felon he
 
04:13:32.570 --> 04:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
committed a homicide and was locked up
 
04:13:34.130 --> 04:13:34.140 align:start position:0%
for it he wanted to be a hunting guide
 
04:13:35.870 --> 04:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
it didn't make sense to me and I said no
 
04:13:37.610 --> 04:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
the rules don't allow for that and he is
 
04:13:40.370 --> 04:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
suing me which is that's a good place to
 
04:13:42.050 --> 04:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
be where I am right now I'm good with
 
04:13:45.530 --> 04:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
that so my point here is even if there's
 
04:13:47.809 --> 04:13:47.819 align:start position:0%
a law like we have a good liability law
 
04:13:50.090 --> 04:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
for hunting even if there's a law you
 
04:13:52.670 --> 04:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
can be sued and it costs money to prove
 
04:13:54.530 --> 04:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
you're right and and a good example of
 
04:13:56.450 --> 04:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
that was the Hunter and the landowner in
 
04:13:58.070 --> 04:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
Deerfield the farmer and I'm embarrassed
 
04:13:59.389 --> 04:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
to tell you I can't remember his name
 
04:14:02.090 --> 04:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
who was sued over a coyote stand if you
 
04:14:04.670 --> 04:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
remember a few years ago caused a huge
 
04:14:06.349 --> 04:14:06.359 align:start position:0%
uproar in liability now he won
 
04:14:09.170 --> 04:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
ultimately uh fairly quickly but he paid
 
04:14:10.849 --> 04:14:10.859 align:start position:0%
some attorney fees that I don't believe
 
04:14:13.610 --> 04:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
he ever recouped so it cost money in
 
04:14:16.309 --> 04:14:16.319 align:start position:0%
America today unfortunately sometimes to
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
prove you're innocent so just keep that
 
04:14:20.389 --> 04:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
in mind so this landowner telling me I'm
 
04:14:22.070 --> 04:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
a little concerned I know the liability
 
04:14:23.990 --> 04:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
law will protect me but I'm concerned
 
04:14:25.790 --> 04:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
that I could still be sued that's a real
 
04:14:28.250 --> 04:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
concern so I you know that kind of
 
04:14:30.769 --> 04:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
encouraged me to file this so so anyway
 
04:14:33.290 --> 04:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
that's in a nutshell the landowners hit
 
04:14:34.969 --> 04:14:34.979 align:start position:0%
on all the other things I think that are
 
04:14:34.979 --> 04:14:36.349 align:start position:0%
on all the other things I think that are
important

04:14:36.349 --> 04:14:36.359 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:14:38.990 --> 04:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you colonel uh representative
 
04:14:39.000 --> 04:14:40.309 align:start position:0%
thank you colonel uh representative
Smith

04:14:40.309 --> 04:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
04:14:41.929 --> 04:14:41.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:14:43.790 --> 04:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
Colonel yes sir for listening to me blow
 
04:14:45.830 --> 04:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
V8 I'm good I'm good with you bullying
 
04:14:47.950 --> 04:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
me you're a very polite bullier
 
04:14:50.990 --> 04:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm reading through this bill and it
 
04:14:53.210 --> 04:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
appears there's no penalty in here
 
04:14:56.389 --> 04:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
other than uh if damages so I'm just
 
04:14:57.469 --> 04:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
going to read what it says to keep it
 
04:15:00.189 --> 04:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
simple it says any person who
 
04:15:02.750 --> 04:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
any person who violates any provision of
 
04:15:04.070 --> 04:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
this section shall be guilty of a
 
04:15:05.750 --> 04:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
violation and shall be liable for the
 
04:15:07.969 --> 04:15:07.979 align:start position:0%
amount of damage caused by the ACT to be
 
04:15:09.590 --> 04:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
recovered by the property owners of
 
04:15:11.030 --> 04:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
standing sustaining the damage that's
 
04:15:13.130 --> 04:15:13.140 align:start position:0%
implying damage to a tree correct but if
 
04:15:14.689 --> 04:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
somebody doesn't label it doesn't get
 
04:15:16.309 --> 04:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
written permission or keeps it out past
 
04:15:18.229 --> 04:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
the deadline there is no penalty in here
 
04:15:20.630 --> 04:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
right and a lot of our laws don't have a
 
04:15:22.130 --> 04:15:22.140 align:start position:0%
penalty within the law because this is
 
04:15:24.170 --> 04:15:24.180 align:start position:0%
amending existing law there's a penalty
 
04:15:27.769 --> 04:15:27.779 align:start position:0%
in the section so in 207 RSA 207 is a
 
04:15:30.469 --> 04:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
penalty uh for violations I I don't know
 
04:15:32.990 --> 04:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
if it specifies a fine amount to be
 
04:15:34.969 --> 04:15:34.979 align:start position:0%
honest with you it may not but it says
 
04:15:36.590 --> 04:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
it's a violation law and you would lose
 
04:15:39.349 --> 04:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
your hunting license for a year like in
 
04:15:41.330 --> 04:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
any anything in this chapter is what it
 
04:15:43.550 --> 04:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
so a lot of times when the laws are
 
04:15:45.710 --> 04:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
written they put one penalty section and
 
04:15:49.130 --> 04:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
a whole in a whole section of 207 or 210
 
04:15:52.550 --> 04:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
has one single penalty statute so that
 
04:15:54.170 --> 04:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
exists we didn't add it to this one
 
04:15:57.050 --> 04:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
because we at we amended existing law so
 
04:15:59.630 --> 04:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
that's why you don't see that
 
04:15:59.640 --> 04:16:03.429 align:start position:0%
that's why you don't see that
foreign

04:16:03.429 --> 04:16:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:05.689 --> 04:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
just carries through into the liability
 
04:16:07.490 --> 04:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh question you were just talking I had
 
04:16:10.189 --> 04:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
a call this morning on my way here same
 
04:16:11.450 --> 04:16:11.460 align:start position:0%
thing a landowner was because he
 
04:16:12.830 --> 04:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
supports the bill concerned about the
 
04:16:15.710 --> 04:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
liability yes so I did some reading
 
04:16:19.729 --> 04:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
um RSA 50814 is the landowner liability
 
04:16:22.790 --> 04:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
law and RSA 21334 is a duty of care law
 
04:16:25.010 --> 04:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
correct so am I correct to understand
 
04:16:27.769 --> 04:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
that this homeowner will be free of
 
04:16:30.110 --> 04:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
liability and he was also concerned
 
04:16:32.269 --> 04:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
about having to pay for a lawyer to
 
04:16:33.950 --> 04:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
defend himself but the law also states
 
04:16:37.309 --> 04:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
that if it's a fraudulent or malicious
 
04:16:38.929 --> 04:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that he can recover the cost
 
04:16:41.330 --> 04:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
from the person making a lawsuit on that
 
04:16:43.010 --> 04:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
you are though unfortunately that
 
04:16:44.990 --> 04:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen very often I I wish
 
04:16:46.610 --> 04:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
courts would pay better attention to
 
04:16:49.130 --> 04:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
that because that's across America today
 
04:16:51.050 --> 04:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
that happens these frivolous lawsuits
 
04:16:52.729 --> 04:16:52.739 align:start position:0%
and people have to go in and defend
 
04:16:54.950 --> 04:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
themselves and win ultimately like the
 
04:16:56.570 --> 04:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
like the farmer did down in Deerfield
 
04:16:58.670 --> 04:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
but it cost him a serious amount of
 
04:17:01.550 --> 04:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
money to do that and and that statute
 
04:17:04.189 --> 04:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
existed and there's sometimes courts
 
04:17:05.689 --> 04:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
don't feel that that's appropriate they
 
04:17:07.309 --> 04:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
felt that the person had the right to
 
04:17:09.290 --> 04:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
bring a lawsuit or penalizing them for
 
04:17:11.090 --> 04:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
doing that and so at the end of the day
 
04:17:12.889 --> 04:17:12.899 align:start position:0%
the landowner still pays that money so
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's a concern the other argument that
 
04:17:16.490 --> 04:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
you could make
 
04:17:18.290 --> 04:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
um I had a landowner bring up a valid
 
04:17:19.429 --> 04:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
point he said that's fine if they're
 
04:17:21.229 --> 04:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
Hunters what if it's a kid
 
04:17:23.210 --> 04:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty good point I told my
 
04:17:25.130 --> 04:17:25.140 align:start position:0%
young officers when we train them don't
 
04:17:26.570 --> 04:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
ever climb one of these because you
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
don't know the guys use three Nails in
 
04:17:30.889 --> 04:17:30.899 align:start position:0%
that step or or One Nail you can fall
 
04:17:33.769 --> 04:17:33.779 align:start position:0%
out of this thing so he his point was if
 
04:17:35.389 --> 04:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
you have these permanent stands which we
 
04:17:37.490 --> 04:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
don't see a lot of but there are some a
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
permanent stand what if a kid or someone
 
04:17:41.389 --> 04:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
else who isn't hunting engaged in
 
04:17:42.889 --> 04:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
Recreation he's just somebody that's
 
04:17:44.809 --> 04:17:44.819 align:start position:0%
wandering on the property for whatever
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
reason climbs up with that same
 
04:17:49.010 --> 04:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
liability protection apply and I don't
 
04:17:50.990 --> 04:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that I think that
 
04:17:52.849 --> 04:17:52.859 align:start position:0%
could be again I think it would cost the
 
04:17:55.910 --> 04:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
landowner money to to prove it so that's
 
04:17:57.950 --> 04:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
a concern
 
04:17:59.450 --> 04:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
all set
 
04:18:02.030 --> 04:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
one real quick we just were talking
 
04:18:03.469 --> 04:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
about permanent stance those are already
 
04:18:05.450 --> 04:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
covered under the existence it is yeah
 
04:18:07.309 --> 04:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
permanent is is very well part of this
 
04:18:08.990 --> 04:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
bill right now because the person we're
 
04:18:10.429 --> 04:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
not changing any of that all these ones
 
04:18:12.769 --> 04:18:12.779 align:start position:0%
I had a neighbor who passed away a
 
04:18:14.870 --> 04:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago but even up till he
 
04:18:17.510 --> 04:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
was 70s he was using these
 
04:18:19.490 --> 04:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
permanent stands he climbed up into that
 
04:18:20.870 --> 04:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
he nailed to the tree in his own
 
04:18:23.510 --> 04:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
property he can do that right but
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
damned if I go up those
 
04:18:28.130 --> 04:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
um and and that's the kind of thing that
 
04:18:29.389 --> 04:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of these people are finding in the
 
04:18:32.510 --> 04:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
woods is like a 30 year old abandoned
 
04:18:36.110 --> 04:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
very dangerous the straps around the
 
04:18:37.729 --> 04:18:37.739 align:start position:0%
ladder stand are not permanent anything
 
04:18:39.950 --> 04:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
that goes around the tree if you're
 
04:18:41.750 --> 04:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
cutting branches to go up you know
 
04:18:44.210 --> 04:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
another example I'm I'm I hunt and I I
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
was using ash trees
 
04:18:47.809 --> 04:18:47.819 align:start position:0%
I don't own those trees they were great
 
04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
trees to hunt on it they're straight no
 
04:18:51.950 --> 04:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
no you know the bark is conducive to it
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
and they're also very valuable but this
 
04:18:55.849 --> 04:18:55.859 align:start position:0%
knucklehead didn't think of that so I
 
04:18:57.469 --> 04:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
was climbing up and down out of this ash
 
04:18:59.570 --> 04:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
tree in the landowner Steve Fifield was
 
04:19:01.370 --> 04:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
a great guy in Canterbury
 
04:19:03.170 --> 04:19:03.180 align:start position:0%
left me a note he didn't know who I was
 
04:19:04.670 --> 04:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
he left me a note on my stand because my
 
04:19:06.229 --> 04:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
name wasn't on it because it didn't
 
04:19:08.150 --> 04:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
require that it's a temporary stand I
 
04:19:09.590 --> 04:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
left the base of the tree left me a note
 
04:19:13.130 --> 04:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
call me I panicked I'm you know I'm the
 
04:19:14.630 --> 04:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
colonel efficient game I must have done
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
something wrong so I grabbed my stand
 
04:19:18.290 --> 04:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
and I headed for the High Country and I
 
04:19:20.809 --> 04:19:20.819 align:start position:0%
got to my Jeep and I drove right to Mr
 
04:19:23.030 --> 04:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
fievel's house and I said I banged on
 
04:19:24.590 --> 04:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
the door and he was shocked to see me
 
04:19:26.630 --> 04:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
and another landowner testified to this
 
04:19:27.710 --> 04:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
early he says you know how many years
 
04:19:30.110 --> 04:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
I've left in cards on tree stands I've
 
04:19:31.849 --> 04:19:31.859 align:start position:0%
never once seen anyone I said well you
 
04:19:34.189 --> 04:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
did today I said I'm guilty and he said
 
04:19:35.689 --> 04:19:35.699 align:start position:0%
the only problem I have with you he said
 
04:19:37.670 --> 04:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
I don't want you in my ash tree those
 
04:19:40.130 --> 04:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
are valuable I said what tree would you
 
04:19:41.929 --> 04:19:41.939 align:start position:0%
like me to go into he said can you pick
 
04:19:44.809 --> 04:19:44.819 align:start position:0%
a pine I said I can but I got to cut a
 
04:19:46.550 --> 04:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
branch to get up a pine because I got
 
04:19:48.769 --> 04:19:48.779 align:start position:0%
branches that's why I use ash and he
 
04:19:50.330 --> 04:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
said I don't mind you cutting a branch
 
04:19:51.769 --> 04:19:51.779 align:start position:0%
I'll sign for that I don't want you in
 
04:19:54.830 --> 04:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
an ash it was that exchange I drove away
 
04:19:57.590 --> 04:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
thinking you know therein lies the
 
04:19:59.689 --> 04:19:59.699 align:start position:0%
problem we don't do that you know I
 
04:20:01.010 --> 04:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
should have done that before he left me
 
04:20:02.870 --> 04:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
the car now we got a good relationship
 
04:20:04.429 --> 04:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
and he calls me every week wondering
 
04:20:05.570 --> 04:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
where we are with the camera bill
 
04:20:08.570 --> 04:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
because he hates cameras so so having
 
04:20:11.510 --> 04:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
that conversation and that mutual
 
04:20:13.370 --> 04:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
respect of the land I I you know what
 
04:20:15.349 --> 04:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
what Dan was talking about really run
 
04:20:17.630 --> 04:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
true to me I mean that you were on that
 
04:20:19.429 --> 04:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
tree and that's a valuable tree I don't
 
04:20:20.990 --> 04:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
look at it like I didn't look at it like
 
04:20:23.929 --> 04:20:23.939 align:start position:0%
that shame on me thank you any further
 
04:20:26.510 --> 04:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative goalie thank
 
04:20:27.830 --> 04:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
04:20:29.570 --> 04:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
a couple questions I'll start off with
 
04:20:31.490 --> 04:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
the first one
 
04:20:34.610 --> 04:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
this just says that
 
04:20:38.809 --> 04:20:38.819 align:start position:0%
they shall be removed by January 1st yes
 
04:20:40.429 --> 04:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop him from removing it
 
04:20:43.309 --> 04:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
December 1st or December 15th when the
 
04:20:44.809 --> 04:20:44.819 align:start position:0%
weather's still good yeah before the
 
04:20:46.849 --> 04:20:46.859 align:start position:0%
snow flies yeah I would remove it right
 
04:20:49.010 --> 04:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
away for that reason I don't want to
 
04:20:50.870 --> 04:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
call climb one when it's icy I want to
 
04:20:52.010 --> 04:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
get it down and out of there that's
 
04:20:53.689 --> 04:20:53.699 align:start position:0%
right you do have that option the only
 
04:20:56.330 --> 04:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
argument you could make against my own
 
04:21:00.830 --> 04:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
bill would be uh the chairman pointed
 
04:21:02.990 --> 04:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
out if you want a coyote right if you
 
04:21:05.269 --> 04:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
want a coyote hunt that happens you know
 
04:21:06.769 --> 04:21:06.779 align:start position:0%
a tree stand would have to be in there
 
04:21:08.210 --> 04:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
in January but again you'd go to the
 
04:21:10.370 --> 04:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
landowner then and ask permission
 
04:21:12.410 --> 04:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
so yes you could remove it prior to
 
04:21:14.389 --> 04:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
January 1 or you could go see your
 
04:21:16.010 --> 04:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
landowner which is what I hope most
 
04:21:17.809 --> 04:21:17.819 align:start position:0%
would do and say is there a problem if I
 
04:21:20.630 --> 04:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
leave it I don't think landowners care
 
04:21:22.309 --> 04:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
about that as long as they know who it
 
04:21:22.319 --> 04:21:23.269 align:start position:0%
about that as long as they know who it
is

04:21:23.269 --> 04:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:21:25.550 --> 04:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh it's not hurting their property and
 
04:21:27.410 --> 04:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
and you're not in the way of one of
 
04:21:29.150 --> 04:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
their Cuts I I can't imagine they tell
 
04:21:30.349 --> 04:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
you to get it out of there why would
 
04:21:30.359 --> 04:21:32.990 align:start position:0%
you to get it out of there why would
they

04:21:32.990 --> 04:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:34.610 --> 04:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:21:34.620 --> 04:21:36.110 align:start position:0%
follow up
and

04:21:36.110 --> 04:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:39.650 --> 04:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:43.849 --> 04:21:43.859 align:start position:0%
all tree stands or observation blinds
 
04:21:47.570 --> 04:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
shall be labeled yes
 
04:21:49.309 --> 04:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
is this included
 
04:21:52.070 --> 04:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
climbing tree stands yes I would think
 
04:21:53.570 --> 04:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
it would include climbing trees because
 
04:21:55.910 --> 04:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
they're portable tree stands and would
 
04:21:57.889 --> 04:21:57.899 align:start position:0%
it include
 
04:22:00.110 --> 04:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
the observation blind I bring out in the
 
04:22:01.550 --> 04:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
woods when I go turkey hunting that I
 
04:22:04.429 --> 04:22:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:07.130 --> 04:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
has a ground blind that's I would
 
04:22:08.750 --> 04:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
probably label that I don't know that
 
04:22:10.729 --> 04:22:10.739 align:start position:0%
I'd ever make a case on that but I would
 
04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
label that with a marker just because it
 
04:22:14.950 --> 04:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
is a temporary
 
04:22:17.090 --> 04:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
blind or stand
 
04:22:18.830 --> 04:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you you're really getting close to
 
04:22:21.050 --> 04:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
the wire but I but I would do it just so
 
04:22:22.670 --> 04:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
that you don't have an issue with it and
 
04:22:24.110 --> 04:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm asking because that's an
 
04:22:25.729 --> 04:22:25.739 align:start position:0%
observation blind so I'm wondering I
 
04:22:27.650 --> 04:22:27.660 align:start position:0%
have one I just want for my comfort
 
04:22:30.110 --> 04:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
should I label it sure yeah I think it'd
 
04:22:32.630 --> 04:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
be better to do it if this passes and
 
04:22:36.410 --> 04:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
one last fall follow up
 
04:22:38.689 --> 04:22:38.699 align:start position:0%
when I was thinking earlier and I
 
04:22:38.699 --> 04:22:40.250 align:start position:0%
when I was thinking earlier and I
suggested

04:22:40.250 --> 04:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
using license numbers instead of
 
04:22:45.889 --> 04:22:45.899 align:start position:0%
identification yep
 
04:22:49.250 --> 04:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
I sat and I thought about it
 
04:22:51.650 --> 04:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
and it came across as that's probably
 
04:22:53.330 --> 04:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
not a good idea
 
04:22:57.410 --> 04:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:59.689 --> 04:22:59.699 align:start position:0%
anyone who does clamming and has to have
 
04:23:01.370 --> 04:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
on their bucket their license number
 
04:23:03.290 --> 04:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
knows it doesn't stay the same license
 
04:23:05.150 --> 04:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
number unless you're a lifetime holder
 
04:23:08.269 --> 04:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
year after year yeah so when you go to a
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
game camera you're going to run out of
 
04:23:11.389 --> 04:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
space on the outside of your camera if
 
04:23:13.070 --> 04:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
you've had more than five or six years
 
04:23:14.510 --> 04:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
it changes that's just something to
 
04:23:15.830 --> 04:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
think about I thought about it and it
 
04:23:18.790 --> 04:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
hit me yeah like that so if yeah
 
04:23:20.990 --> 04:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
and the landowner made a great point
 
04:23:22.429 --> 04:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
when he said I really don't want to call
 
04:23:24.170 --> 04:23:24.180 align:start position:0%
law enforcement every time sometimes I
 
04:23:26.570 --> 04:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
want to call my Hunter and just tell him
 
04:23:29.630 --> 04:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
you know kind of made sense so I don't
 
04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
think it's the problem imagine me put my
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
name on a tree stand
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
you know I mean I've made one or two
 
04:23:38.929 --> 04:23:38.939 align:start position:0%
enemies in this 33 years so how many
 
04:23:40.969 --> 04:23:40.979 align:start position:0%
tree stands we want to buy what's that
 
04:23:42.349 --> 04:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
how many tree stands you want to buy oh
 
04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
yeah you got to buy or or cut the tree
 
04:23:46.070 --> 04:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
half down and I get up in it you're
 
04:23:48.349 --> 04:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
replacing it out yeah yeah I don't see
 
04:23:50.269 --> 04:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
the issues to be honest with you I don't
 
04:23:52.370 --> 04:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
see anti-hunting people I won't say it
 
04:23:54.229 --> 04:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen but I I don't receive
 
04:23:56.809 --> 04:23:56.819 align:start position:0%
those calls and I think I would if it
 
04:23:58.670 --> 04:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
was a problem I think we'd hear it I
 
04:24:00.889 --> 04:24:00.899 align:start position:0%
think even the anti-hunters uh wouldn't
 
04:24:03.170 --> 04:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
call on you but uh
 
04:24:05.809 --> 04:24:05.819 align:start position:0%
yeah you're probably right to that point
 
04:24:07.790 --> 04:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
I will follow up on his comment on the
 
04:24:07.800 --> 04:24:08.870 align:start position:0%
I will follow up on his comment on the
licenses

04:24:08.870 --> 04:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
04:24:10.910 --> 04:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
as somebody who has always labeled my
 
04:24:13.250 --> 04:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
tree stand and cameras I always print a
 
04:24:14.929 --> 04:24:14.939 align:start position:0%
new label each year and stick it on
 
04:24:17.050 --> 04:24:17.060 align:start position:0%
anyway because after the winter it's
 
04:24:20.210 --> 04:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
often faded and not any good and we
 
04:24:22.130 --> 04:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
didn't while you speak of that we didn't
 
04:24:23.929 --> 04:24:23.939 align:start position:0%
specify how you do that you know we
 
04:24:26.090 --> 04:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
talked about that at my agency whether
 
04:24:28.070 --> 04:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
we were going to engrave it or put I
 
04:24:29.510 --> 04:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to leave it open for people to do
 
04:24:31.010 --> 04:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
whatever they wanted but you're right if
 
04:24:32.510 --> 04:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
you're putting just a label that would
 
04:24:34.610 --> 04:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
be simple if you're engraving it which I
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
see some people would do I think some
 
04:24:38.389 --> 04:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
would then you'd have to change that
 
04:24:40.429 --> 04:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
license number but I'm as long as we can
 
04:24:42.710 --> 04:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
find out who that owner is I don't care
 
04:24:45.530 --> 04:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
what we put on it
 
04:24:47.870 --> 04:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative Khan
 
04:24:49.910 --> 04:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:24:52.969 --> 04:24:52.979 align:start position:0%
Cardinal Jordan yes sir thank you again
 
04:24:57.530 --> 04:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
uh again I want to go back to line uh 20
 
04:24:57.540 --> 04:25:01.910 align:start position:0%
uh again I want to go back to line uh 20
uh

04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:05.809 --> 04:25:05.819 align:start position:0%
26 the violation part yes
 
04:25:09.290 --> 04:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
so is it any harm that if we put the
 
04:25:11.750 --> 04:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
penalty amount or something there is a
 
04:25:16.550 --> 04:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill to me not to have when I reading
 
04:25:19.610 --> 04:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
the law and it doesn't say what is my
 
04:25:21.110 --> 04:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
penalty I have to go to a few other
 
04:25:24.710 --> 04:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
Pages it to me it's it gives the law a
 
04:25:27.830 --> 04:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
little bit softer portion yep I I don't
 
04:25:30.410 --> 04:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
think there's any issue with changing it
 
04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
to read whatever you want no whatever
 
04:25:36.590 --> 04:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
you one you know but I like to see
 
04:25:39.469 --> 04:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
them there in the law so everybody knows
 
04:25:41.389 --> 04:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
when they read it is this is the penalty
 
04:25:44.990 --> 04:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:47.149 --> 04:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:25:49.670 --> 04:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
04:25:51.710 --> 04:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
04:25:53.630 --> 04:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
Colonel yes sir I know you've already
 
04:25:55.429 --> 04:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
said this twice so I'm going to start
 
04:25:55.439 --> 04:25:58.849 align:start position:0%
said this twice so I'm going to start
again

04:25:58.849 --> 04:25:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:02.210 --> 04:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
uh for Diane Richardson's comments on
 
04:26:04.790 --> 04:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
the concern about names we are in
 
04:26:07.729 --> 04:26:07.739 align:start position:0%
putting names on anything because we are
 
04:26:09.950 --> 04:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
in a new world for sure absolutely and I
 
04:26:11.149 --> 04:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
don't know if that means that we all
 
04:26:13.670 --> 04:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
need to just maybe watch how this works
 
04:26:17.450 --> 04:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
out and uh I think she has a legitimate
 
04:26:19.550 --> 04:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
point that people can take names I I
 
04:26:20.990 --> 04:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's anti-hunters out
 
04:26:23.450 --> 04:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
in the woods uh taking names or not but
 
04:26:26.149 --> 04:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
right she's she says that she's seen
 
04:26:28.729 --> 04:26:28.739 align:start position:0%
that so I think we should all just be
 
04:26:30.469 --> 04:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
aware of that and pay attention to it
 
04:26:32.929 --> 04:26:32.939 align:start position:0%
yeah it's not a question I guess but no
 
04:26:34.849 --> 04:26:34.859 align:start position:0%
no but I understand your point I mean I
 
04:26:37.070 --> 04:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
I think I know we have a lot of stuff
 
04:26:39.349 --> 04:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
now that's labeled and we've not had any
 
04:26:41.689 --> 04:26:41.699 align:start position:0%
issues the one I really suspected an
 
04:26:43.550 --> 04:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
issue with was trapping
 
04:26:46.910 --> 04:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
trapping we require a tag and it's it
 
04:26:49.550 --> 04:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
the people that don't like harvesting
 
04:26:52.130 --> 04:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
animals are probably trapping leads that
 
04:26:55.309 --> 04:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
charge and I've never had a Trapper that
 
04:26:56.929 --> 04:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
I'm up to my knowledge I've never had a
 
04:26:59.689 --> 04:26:59.699 align:start position:0%
Trapper harass that ever so I I just
 
04:27:01.849 --> 04:27:01.859 align:start position:0%
didn't think it was an issue but but I
 
04:27:03.469 --> 04:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
I'm flexible either way as long as we
 
04:27:05.269 --> 04:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
can determine that's the big complaint
 
04:27:06.590 --> 04:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
from landowners is being able to
 
04:27:08.630 --> 04:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
determine who who it is and how do I get
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
them I don't I don't care how we do that
 
04:27:12.290 --> 04:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:27:15.649 --> 04:27:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:19.010 --> 04:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
okay I've got a couple myself oh
 
04:27:21.170 --> 04:27:21.180 align:start position:0%
um I cannot wait try to save myself by
 
04:27:22.429 --> 04:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
the end
 
04:27:24.410 --> 04:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
um and one of them was already asked and
 
04:27:24.420 --> 04:27:25.670 align:start position:0%
um and one of them was already asked and
answered

04:27:25.670 --> 04:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
answered
 
04:27:27.229 --> 04:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
um there's no info in here about who can
 
04:27:29.210 --> 04:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
remove them if they go past the date no
 
04:27:31.370 --> 04:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
there isn't and uh we didn't put
 
04:27:33.229 --> 04:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
anything in there and so I get a
 
04:27:34.729 --> 04:27:34.739 align:start position:0%
combination of things there I have
 
04:27:36.889 --> 04:27:36.899 align:start position:0%
landowners do it which which always
 
04:27:38.750 --> 04:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
concerns me for the many reasons I've
 
04:27:40.490 --> 04:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
told you we didn't we didn't put a
 
04:27:42.769 --> 04:27:42.779 align:start position:0%
restriction in here that only we could
 
04:27:44.990 --> 04:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
do that I think it was just an oversight
 
04:27:47.809 --> 04:27:47.819 align:start position:0%
but I I have concerns about landowners
 
04:27:49.969 --> 04:27:49.979 align:start position:0%
doing it just because as I told you
 
04:27:51.290 --> 04:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
earlier if they don't return it right
 
04:27:54.170 --> 04:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
away is theft if they do damage to it
 
04:27:56.090 --> 04:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
they're liable for the damage I'd prefer
 
04:27:57.830 --> 04:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
that they call us and a lot of
 
04:27:59.809 --> 04:27:59.819 align:start position:0%
landowners do that and we go in and
 
04:28:01.910 --> 04:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
remove them so
 
04:28:06.469 --> 04:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
okay uh next comment we already did talk
 
04:28:08.870 --> 04:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
about the date but are you stuck with
 
04:28:11.630 --> 04:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
January No my only thing I would ask you
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
to no my uh I I think we picked that
 
04:28:15.530 --> 04:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
date because it was it was the end of
 
04:28:17.090 --> 04:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
the year
 
04:28:19.189 --> 04:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
um uh the only thing I would ask you to
 
04:28:21.889 --> 04:28:21.899 align:start position:0%
consider is wintertime Cuts because a
 
04:28:24.170 --> 04:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
lot of times this pre these Cuts happen
 
04:28:25.550 --> 04:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
in the winter months they can't do them
 
04:28:28.250 --> 04:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
any other time so that would that might
 
04:28:31.010 --> 04:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
get in the way of that so this may be a
 
04:28:32.450 --> 04:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
better question for the Timberland
 
04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
Runners Association I would agree uh I
 
04:28:36.710 --> 04:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
might call him back up but I'd like to
 
04:28:39.290 --> 04:28:39.300 align:start position:0%
know what what times what months they do
 
04:28:42.170 --> 04:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
cuts in I do think it's important to
 
04:28:44.090 --> 04:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
pick a date I think you have to have an
 
04:28:47.570 --> 04:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
absolute date but I but I'm not sold on
 
04:28:49.010 --> 04:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
what I do agree with you that if the
 
04:28:50.570 --> 04:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
name's on it and they have to do a cut
 
04:28:52.070 --> 04:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
there they can obviously reach the
 
04:28:54.710 --> 04:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
person sure and if the name's not on it
 
04:28:57.790 --> 04:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
then obviously it's a violation anyway
 
04:29:01.370 --> 04:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
right uh you have written permission
 
04:29:03.769 --> 04:29:03.779 align:start position:0%
again was that intentional because that
 
04:29:05.809 --> 04:29:05.819 align:start position:0%
was in the law existing so written
 
04:29:07.849 --> 04:29:07.859 align:start position:0%
permission was existing correct you have
 
04:29:10.790 --> 04:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
Express written permission yeah that's
 
04:29:12.349 --> 04:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
because they have to have we have a
 
04:29:14.750 --> 04:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
permit and then down below you just have
 
04:29:25.450 --> 04:29:25.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:27.830 --> 04:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
and that law has been that way for many
 
04:29:29.689 --> 04:29:29.699 align:start position:0%
many years we've never made a case if
 
04:29:31.550 --> 04:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
again if a landowner because a lot of
 
04:29:32.990 --> 04:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
times land owners won't write it down
 
04:29:35.870 --> 04:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
and so if we go in and we find a tree
 
04:29:37.729 --> 04:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
stand and a hunter tells us they have
 
04:29:38.990 --> 04:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
permission but they just don't have it
 
04:29:40.849 --> 04:29:40.859 align:start position:0%
in writing we've never held anyone
 
04:29:42.950 --> 04:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
responsible for that so as long as they
 
04:29:44.809 --> 04:29:44.819 align:start position:0%
have permission another another point I
 
04:29:46.250 --> 04:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
was going to make on that is if if a
 
04:29:47.450 --> 04:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
landowner is asked to give written
 
04:29:49.490 --> 04:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
permission to use a tree stand they may
 
04:29:50.990 --> 04:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
be hesitant because they may think that
 
04:29:52.550 --> 04:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
they're taking on liability by letting
 
04:29:54.229 --> 04:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
someone go up a tree I will tell you
 
04:29:56.330 --> 04:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
from personal experience I've asked for
 
04:29:57.950 --> 04:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
it many times and they've told me that
 
04:30:00.469 --> 04:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
so and so we don't hold hunters or
 
04:30:02.630 --> 04:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
Sports men and women to that if they as
 
04:30:04.490 --> 04:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
long as they have permission so would
 
04:30:05.870 --> 04:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
you mind if that went to permission
 
04:30:07.729 --> 04:30:07.739 align:start position:0%
instead of written permission
 
04:30:10.670 --> 04:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
I would not mind that okay no I would
 
04:30:10.680 --> 04:30:12.229 align:start position:0%
I would not mind that okay no I would
not

04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:30:15.469 --> 04:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
we talked about name yep
 
04:30:18.110 --> 04:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
the only other thing I have down here
 
04:30:18.120 --> 04:30:20.389 align:start position:0%
the only other thing I have down here
um

04:30:20.389 --> 04:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:23.990 --> 04:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
is the date yes again 60 days
 
04:30:27.050 --> 04:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
I know that 60 days after passage oh oh
 
04:30:29.450 --> 04:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
the effective day effective date yeah 60
 
04:30:31.370 --> 04:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
days after passage seems to never work
 
04:30:33.889 --> 04:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
well for uh any anybody that has to make
 
04:30:36.229 --> 04:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
rules around it I think OLS picked that
 
04:30:38.510 --> 04:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't so OLS has been doing that by
 
04:30:39.950 --> 04:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
default and it's caused a lot of
 
04:30:41.330 --> 04:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
problems which is why I look for it now
 
04:30:42.889 --> 04:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
sure sure so that should be next
 
04:30:45.170 --> 04:30:45.180 align:start position:0%
calendar year correct I'm fine with that
 
04:30:45.180 --> 04:30:48.649 align:start position:0%
calendar year correct I'm fine with that
yeah

04:30:48.649 --> 04:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:50.929 --> 04:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
oh right that's all I had any other
 
04:30:52.969 --> 04:30:52.979 align:start position:0%
questions representative Smith thank you
 
04:30:54.469 --> 04:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you Colonel I just
 
04:30:56.149 --> 04:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
like to get clarity you just stated a
 
04:30:57.530 --> 04:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
minute ago
 
04:30:59.630 --> 04:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
um if a homeowner or landowner removes a
 
04:31:01.309 --> 04:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
stand it would be considered theft but
 
04:31:02.809 --> 04:31:02.819 align:start position:0%
we discussed that during the game camera
 
04:31:05.269 --> 04:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
Bill and you should be could be yeah
 
04:31:07.250 --> 04:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
it's not an absolute thing so if you
 
04:31:08.990 --> 04:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
took I'll give you an example of when it
 
04:31:11.090 --> 04:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
could be considered theft if you took a
 
04:31:12.950 --> 04:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
tree stand
 
04:31:15.710 --> 04:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
um and you didn't return it to the
 
04:31:17.510 --> 04:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
landowner you couldn't identify the
 
04:31:19.189 --> 04:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
landowner or you could identify the
 
04:31:20.689 --> 04:31:20.699 align:start position:0%
landowner you just didn't get around to
 
04:31:23.809 --> 04:31:23.819 align:start position:0%
do it and uh and a property owner or the
 
04:31:25.490 --> 04:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
owner of the tree stand knows that you
 
04:31:27.349 --> 04:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
have it and you failed to return it to
 
04:31:30.590 --> 04:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
him they call us and reported as stolen
 
04:31:32.570 --> 04:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
and so that just creates a whole mess
 
04:31:35.929 --> 04:31:35.939 align:start position:0%
from you seizing it you it is excuse me
 
04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
it isn't a guarantee you would be
 
04:31:38.570 --> 04:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
charged with theft
 
04:31:40.370 --> 04:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
if you make a reasonable attempt to get
 
04:31:42.469 --> 04:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
it back you you wouldn't be yeah no
 
04:31:44.750 --> 04:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's uh it just puts you in
 
04:31:47.750 --> 04:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:52.250 --> 04:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions at all
 
04:31:55.250 --> 04:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much seeing none uh
 
04:32:00.889 --> 04:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
you're uh all set and I saw a question
 
04:32:03.469 --> 04:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
oh you wanted to ask him a question
 
04:32:05.689 --> 04:32:05.699 align:start position:0%
can you do it offline or does it is it
 
04:32:06.769 --> 04:32:06.779 align:start position:0%
something the committee might want to
 
04:32:06.779 --> 04:32:07.670 align:start position:0%
something the committee might want to
hear

04:32:07.670 --> 04:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
hear
 
04:32:08.990 --> 04:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
if it's something the committee might
 
04:32:10.250 --> 04:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
want to hear you can join him at the
 
04:32:13.550 --> 04:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
table and use the microphone
 
04:32:16.070 --> 04:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
concern I guess the liability thing I
 
04:32:21.170 --> 04:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
got thinking about and uh so if you have
 
04:32:23.809 --> 04:32:23.819 align:start position:0%
a tree stand or somebody's put one up on
 
04:32:26.570 --> 04:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
a piece of property and naturally it's
 
04:32:28.130 --> 04:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
not going to be in the backyard but
 
04:32:30.110 --> 04:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
there's Woods roads and trails and
 
04:32:31.969 --> 04:32:31.979 align:start position:0%
because the kids play on them and
 
04:32:35.389 --> 04:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
whatever so would the land only be
 
04:32:38.330 --> 04:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
liable for these kids under a certain
 
04:32:40.790 --> 04:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
age or above a certain age if they try
 
04:32:43.309 --> 04:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
to climb that thing and get hurt
 
04:32:46.550 --> 04:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
who's going to get sued well you any
 
04:32:48.530 --> 04:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
just remember anybody can be sued for
 
04:32:51.889 --> 04:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
anything right or wrong so I think my
 
04:32:54.410 --> 04:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
point to that was if you are engaged the
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
largest specific to outdoor recreation
 
04:32:59.870 --> 04:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
so a hunter is doing that a kid running
 
04:33:01.849 --> 04:33:01.859 align:start position:0%
up the tree because he wants to get a
 
04:33:04.730 --> 04:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
see what it is is not doing that so I
 
04:33:07.609 --> 04:33:07.619 align:start position:0%
think the window opens a little for the
 
04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
landowner maybe some responsibility
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
I I won't say that you wouldn't win it
 
04:33:14.570 --> 04:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
because I because I I think you probably
 
04:33:17.570 --> 04:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
would but it would cost you money it
 
04:33:20.090 --> 04:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
could it could yeah it has a similar
 
04:33:21.349 --> 04:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
incidence like when they get a
 
04:33:23.869 --> 04:33:23.879 align:start position:0%
playground set in the backyard yeah and
 
04:33:25.551 --> 04:33:25.561 align:start position:0%
maybe you've told the neighbors and
 
04:33:28.429 --> 04:33:28.439 align:start position:0%
their kids they're not to be over there
 
04:33:30.590 --> 04:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
and they come anyway so I'll add into
 
04:33:32.029 --> 04:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
that that you should look up the
 
04:33:34.070 --> 04:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
attractive nuisance laws
 
04:33:36.230 --> 04:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
because the attractive nuisance laws are
 
04:33:37.849 --> 04:33:37.859 align:start position:0%
the ones that govern the playsets that
 
04:33:39.529 --> 04:33:39.539 align:start position:0%
aren't fenced in the pools that aren't
 
04:33:40.849 --> 04:33:40.859 align:start position:0%
fenced in in any of these other
 
04:33:43.429 --> 04:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
situations where what you've provided is
 
04:33:45.470 --> 04:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
an attractive nuisance that may attract
 
04:33:47.330 --> 04:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
people to come onto the property and
 
04:33:50.029 --> 04:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
then get themselves harmed and it
 
04:33:51.529 --> 04:33:51.539 align:start position:0%
requires that you take reasonable
 
04:33:53.750 --> 04:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
precautions from somebody doing so in
 
04:33:55.250 --> 04:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
the case of a pool it means putting a
 
04:33:57.709 --> 04:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
fence up around it and that fence is
 
04:34:00.109 --> 04:34:00.119 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a deterrent and a signal
 
04:34:02.269 --> 04:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
to the person you're not welcome here
 
04:34:02.279 --> 04:34:03.590 align:start position:0%
to the person you're not welcome here
so

04:34:03.590 --> 04:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:34:06.109 --> 04:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
um the attractive nuisance laws would
 
04:34:08.330 --> 04:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
probably be the same as the swing set
 
04:34:10.551 --> 04:34:10.561 align:start position:0%
and in that type of situation
 
04:34:10.561 --> 04:34:12.170 align:start position:0%
and in that type of situation
okay

04:34:12.170 --> 04:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:34:14.869 --> 04:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:16.849 --> 04:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:18.590 --> 04:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
all right I guess I'm going to close now
 
04:34:20.029 --> 04:34:20.039 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
04:34:22.010 --> 04:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
um on sb15
 
04:34:22.020 --> 04:34:24.369 align:start position:0%
um on sb15
foreign

04:34:24.369 --> 04:34:24.379 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:34:26.209 --> 04:34:26.219 align:start position:0%
for today
 
04:34:27.890 --> 04:34:27.900 align:start position:0%
I'll tell the committee we will not be
 
04:34:30.109 --> 04:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
executing these bills until at least the
 
04:34:30.119 --> 04:34:32.090 align:start position:0%
executing these bills until at least the
25th

04:34:32.090 --> 04:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
25th
 
04:34:34.910 --> 04:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
and I will let everybody know more about
 
04:34:38.330 --> 04:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
that as we get closer to it but uh it
 
04:34:39.650 --> 04:34:39.660 align:start position:0%
won't happen next week and the week
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
after I'm going to be in Quebec so uh
 
04:34:44.029 --> 04:34:44.039 align:start position:0%
the 25th would be the first Tuesday that
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
we could actually take any action
 
04:34:48.830 --> 04:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
use that time to read up on the laws and
 
04:35:17.109 --> 04:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
