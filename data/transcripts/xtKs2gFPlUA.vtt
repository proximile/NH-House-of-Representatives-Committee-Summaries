money and should either be in budget
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%

yes we can hear you now sir
 
00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:14.039 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
committee's call back from Recess a 10
 
00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
o'clock meeting
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
we'll now begin our discussions of hb1
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
this is the budget Bill the appropriates
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
the funds to run the state government
 
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
for the two fiscal years beginning on
 
00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:29.900 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2021 through June 30
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
2023 these are fiscal years 2022 through
 
00:28:36.409 --> 00:28:36.419 align:start position:0%
2023. the New Hampshire Constitution
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
requires that all spending bills
 
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
originate in the House of
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
Representatives the steps in this budget
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
began last fall with the agency
 
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
submitting their proposals these were
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
reviewed by administrative Services then
 
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
the governor's office it's required that
 
00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposal come to the
 
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
house by February 15th and about that
 
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
same time the house committee on ways
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
and means the committee with the
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
expertise on tax policy and revenues
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
gives an estimate on projected revenues
 
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
for those two fiscal years this sets the
 
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
target for spending that we must not
 
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
exceed the legislative process requires
 
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
that our actions result in legislation
 
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
thus the budget must be a bill that
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
becomes law it is traditionally hb1 and
 
00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
the enabling legislation that sets the
 
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
tax policy in any rural organization
 
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
required is hb2 as the finance chair I
 
00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:30.299 align:start position:0%
sponsor both hb1 and hb2 and the three
 
00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
division chairs in our committees are
 
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors we rely on the accountants
 
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
and legislative budget assistant office
 
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
and the lawyers in the office of
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
legislative services to put these bills
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
in the proper format we only have about
 
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
five weeks to review and balance the
 
00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
budget so we divide the task into
 
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
functional areas that our permanent
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittees which we call divisions
 
00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
one two and three
 
00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
we'll work on you will hear from the
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
chair of each division any in turn as
 
00:29:59.210 --> 00:29:59.220 align:start position:0%
they explain their Pro their portion of
 
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
the budget the process from the house to
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
the Senate to the governor is called
 
00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.789 align:start position:0%
the Senate to the governor is called
appropriation

00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:30:06.289 --> 00:30:06.299 align:start position:0%
it's the time
 
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
and there's the spending Authority for
 
00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
the government agencies there were over
 
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
1 500 pages of accounting limits or Aus
 
00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:17.659 align:start position:0%
with the line items for each unit in hb1
 
00:30:21.649 --> 00:30:21.659 align:start position:0%
hb2 had 150 pages with over 200 separate
 
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
articles many AES or accounting units we
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
found acceptable as filed
 
00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:31.820 align:start position:0%
so we'll have a roll call after each
 
00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
division makes that presentation and
 
00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
perhaps they might be amendments in
 
00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:39.539 align:start position:0%
there that we may have to not do another
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
roll call on as well so we'll wait till
 
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
each division has finished a briefing on
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
that portion and then we'll have the
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
roll call vote so we'll call upon
 
00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
representative Ober chair of division
 
00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:54.380 align:start position:0%
one and explain what division one
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
sections they they deal with and what
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
they've done with the budget
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative Ober
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:06.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you to the LBA staff who supported
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
us we have a huge work effort if you
 
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
look our detailed Change Report is nine
 
00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
pages long hp2 amendment is another 93
 
00:31:21.169 --> 00:31:21.179 align:start position:0%
Pages we had a tremendous effort on the
 
00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
part of Michael Hoffman Nancy lavinus
 
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
plus Michael Caine and Christopher Shea
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
but we also had support from other
 
00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:30.899 align:start position:0%
committee members Ways and Means had a
 
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
number of sections that we were asked to
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
deal with plus added some Wars we went
 
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
along Edna helped out with some policy
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
sections help from Science and Tech
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
environment agriculture just almost too
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
many people to name to thank everybody
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
the seven members of our division worked
 
00:31:50.889 --> 00:31:50.899 align:start position:0%
very diligently
 
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
last November Kenway and I attended
 
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
three days of budget hearings in
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
November it was apparent to us that a
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
number of agencies the division one
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
overseas would see and be facing
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
significant layoffs unless there were
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
changes in the budgets however those
 
00:32:09.409 --> 00:32:09.419 align:start position:0%
changes didn't come three of our
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
agencies were hit
 
00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
our agencies division one agencies were
 
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
hit very badly with more than 50 late
 
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
direct layoffs the normal Ploy in the
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
budget is to unfund vacant positions for
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
example there were 89 vacant positions
 
00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
in Des there are hundreds of vacant
 
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
positions in HHS so normally with the
 
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
governor does is unfund those rather
 
00:32:36.889 --> 00:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:39.649 --> 00:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
this was a really hard situation for all
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
the division members and I think we
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
probably were all having nightmares of
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
hungry kids telling us that we laid off
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
their parents but together we work
 
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
through all of this so before we turn to
 
00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.850 align:start position:0%
through all of this so before we turn to
the

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
direct Change Report let me give you a
 
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
few highlights
 
00:32:59.330 --> 00:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
the part of their mid-services is a
 
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
central Service Agency they do payroll
 
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:05.220 align:start position:0%
they do all kinds of things throughout
 
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
state government maintenance of
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
buildings they're responsible contract
 
00:33:12.409 --> 00:33:12.419 align:start position:0%
bidding they're responsible they have a
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
unit that does all of the insurances for
 
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
all of the employees they are absolutely
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
critical to every agency
 
00:33:23.049 --> 00:33:23.059 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that the division
 
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
utilized savings from Errata and
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
insurance reallocation to restore 20
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
positions in this agency
 
00:33:33.649 --> 00:33:33.659 align:start position:0%
we move the Appropriations to pay for
 
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
the sheriff's transport and security
 
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
prisoners out of the budget of Das where
 
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it ever belonged and
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
into the judicial branch which is
 
00:33:45.769 --> 00:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
allowed by state law this also eased
 
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
some of the problems that represent
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
hatch and representatives reported from
 
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
the North country and the North Country
 
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
budget so we listen carefully to where
 
00:33:59.149 --> 00:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
every agency impacted everybody in our
 
00:33:59.159 --> 00:34:00.110 align:start position:0%
every agency impacted everybody in our
state

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
we deleted 500 000 in premature budget
 
00:34:06.289 --> 00:34:06.299 align:start position:0%
dollars for a law enforcement commission
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
that has not yet been recommended but
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
was actually budgeted at 517 thousand
 
00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
dollars in Das we allocated the cost of
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
cyber security which impacts every state
 
00:34:17.879 --> 00:34:19.010 align:start position:0%
cyber security which impacts every state
agency

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
through doit which it should have been
 
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
five years ago
 
00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:27.899 align:start position:0%
in doit we've provided an appropriation
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
to restore for shared and funded
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
positions for some reason their budget
 
00:34:33.359 --> 00:34:34.129 align:start position:0%
positions for some reason their budget
cut

00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
cut
 
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
half of the staff that answers the phone
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
at the help desk so if you have a
 
00:34:40.609 --> 00:34:40.619 align:start position:0%
computer problem and you call up and you
 
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
say hey I need help half of those
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
positions which were filled were cut we
 
00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:47.339 align:start position:0%
restored that
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
however more than 20 patent positions
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
remain unfunded this is a potential
 
00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.849 align:start position:0%
remain unfunded this is a potential
impact

00:34:54.849 --> 00:34:54.859 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:56.570 align:start position:0%
impact
across

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
across
 
00:34:59.690 --> 00:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
every agency as we go forward
 
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to say at this point in
 
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
time I think everybody probably heard
 
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
that the governor had a few comments
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
during his last press release about how
 
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
the house was handling the budget and
 
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
how the Senate would handle it it's been
 
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
my experience that we have been very
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
collaborative with the Senate however
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
the Senate has stayed out of the budget
 
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
when we're over here we typically stay
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
out of their budget we do share
 
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
information with them they share
 
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
information with us it has been a joint
 
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
effort and I would like it to remain a
 
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
joint effort and Chuck Morse Gary
 
00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:34.370 align:start position:0%
joint effort and Chuck Morse Gary
Daniels

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
Daniels
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
Bob guide all the people who have worked
 
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
on the budget before have continued to
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
work with us and did so now
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
in dra we added to auditor positions and
 
00:35:46.849 --> 00:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
we did that because we would get a total
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
of 3.2 million dollars more in Revenue
 
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
and I thank everybody on finance knows
 
00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:56.700 align:start position:0%
went to the housing Ways and Means
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates were passed
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
house finance needed to cut 49 million
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
dollars from the governor's budget or ad
 
00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:08.579 align:start position:0%
Revenue so we added some Revenue
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
Treasury and Corrections
 
00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
all of the Educational Funding
 
00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:17.339 align:start position:0%
in Corrections all of the academic
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
training funding in Corrections
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
had been cut and all the people laid off
 
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
and what we did was we changed the
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation for the
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
Governor's scholarship fund to one
 
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
dollar knowing that money was coming for
 
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
in the current
 
00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
budget from the feds for a covered
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
release and we use that money to restore
 
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
most of the training and Vocational and
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
academic training in Corrections that
 
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
service was of course fully funded even
 
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
though it has grown
 
00:36:50.329 --> 00:36:50.339 align:start position:0%
the justice department we recognize some
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
general fund savings by delaying the
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
start of a new program
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
and delaying the start of two attorney
 
00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
positions they did get all of their
 
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
positions funded just not the first day
 
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
in The Liquor Commission we had an
 
00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.790 align:start position:0%
in The Liquor Commission we had an
amendment

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:08.060 align:start position:0%
that proposes to change the liquor
 
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
enforcement to a liquor Licensing Bureau
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to thank representative
 
00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
wishman for all of the work he did on
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
in Corrections transitional housing was
 
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
cut for Concord and Manchester
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
we were able to restore that
 
00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
the relatively small cost of restoring
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
far outweighed by the benefits that
 
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
transitional housing provides
 
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
we did restore the vocational
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
Educational Funding as I said
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
the parole board was reorganized to just
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
five members including the chairman
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
which the governor had proposed the
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
parole board is finally going to use
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
some digital technology if you've ever
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
watched them they have a mountain of
 
00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:53.220 align:start position:0%
paper every time they meet but we're
 
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
actually going to provide some digital
 
00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
technology we also had to provide
 
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
networking access so that they could use
 
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
their digital technology and we kind of
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
did that at the last minute and then
 
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
right before we were done within
 
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
we found out that the building they're
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
in is going to be sold and we had to add
 
00:38:14.569 --> 00:38:14.579 align:start position:0%
funding so that they would have new
 
00:38:14.579 --> 00:38:16.430 align:start position:0%
funding so that they would have new
housing

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
our Corrections Officers remains an
 
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
issue we discussed it extensively with
 
00:38:23.569 --> 00:38:23.579 align:start position:0%
the commissioner even when she hires
 
00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
them they're all trying just police
 
00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
officers because our pay level is so low
 
00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:31.619 align:start position:0%
they get trained as a corrections
 
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
officer which means they are now
 
00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
certified police officer six to 12
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
months down the line they're looking for
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
a better paying job with the local
 
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
police department that's something that
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
we need to take on not in this budget
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
but we need to think about how we're
 
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:47.660 align:start position:0%
going to retain them
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
we increased the funding provided to the
 
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
Small Business Development Center and
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
business and economic Affairs the
 
00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
governor had originally budgeted at
 
00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars for the coming
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
year and nothing in the year after the
 
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
budget they have in their budget
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
currently is three hundred and fifteen
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars however we looked at
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
how much they had spent in the previous
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
year which was a hundred and sixty
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and we restored the
 
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
funding to two hundred and twenty five
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
thousand in each of the two years what
 
00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
we did was we reduced the amount of
 
00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
money they have in travel and tourism to
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
do this one of the reasons we were
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
reducing of course is because at 49
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
million dollars we had to cut and
 
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
chairman Weiler would say to me
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
periodically in the hall I hope you're
 
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
cutting because division two isn't going
 
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
to be able to cut he's he's smiling he's
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
shaking his head because he knew he was
 
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
giving me nightmares
 
00:39:41.569 --> 00:39:41.579 align:start position:0%
part of the planning on the office of
 
00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
strategic and management has now been
 
00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
put in business and economic Affairs
 
00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
where it will actually do planning
 
00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
functions for the first time
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
we had a really tough decision with
 
00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
00:39:58.609 --> 00:39:58.619 align:start position:0%
we have suspended the way the water
 
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:00.839 align:start position:0%
treatment grants for the biennium
 
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
not something anybody on the division
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to do
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
but I also worked heavily with LBA and
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
again I can't thank them enough for the
 
00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:11.339 align:start position:0%
work that they did for us
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
we got it
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
um an amendment put into hb2
 
00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
that will allow the department of Des to
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
come to fiscal at the end of every six
 
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
months and request up to 50 percent of
 
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
the Surplus above planned expenditure
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
and apply it to the wastewater treatment
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
I talked to commissioner Bob Scott he
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
knew why we were doing what we were
 
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
doing giving the ways and means
 
00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
estimates he said he felt like it was a
 
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable start
 
00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
I frequently say and I think you guys do
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
too the Senate always has more money
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
than we have and I know this makes Chuck
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
Norris cringe but the reality is we
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
passed the budget out of here in March
 
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
and in April the business taxes come in
 
00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
and frequently that is a big month for
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
us if they come in above plan the Senate
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
ends up with a little bit more money
 
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
military Affairs came in they were fully
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
funded they are finally going to do some
 
00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:09.740 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Services as you'll see
 
00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.329 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Services as you'll see
oplc

00:41:11.329 --> 00:41:11.339 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
we did the last piece of their
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
reorganization in hb2 which was started
 
00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
last biennium but got lost when we had
 
00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and some of the scramble at
 
00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
the end with the big
 
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
bills that we did not pass
 
00:41:29.089 --> 00:41:29.099 align:start position:0%
the new Department it's been something
 
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
that's been discussed for several years
 
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
it's the department of energy
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
and we were lucky to have
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
the gentlelady from Beau whose husband
 
00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
attorney Harry Judd has worked in this
 
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:44.220 align:start position:0%
area a lot and so you learn a lot at
 
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
home and she's also an attorney so she
 
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
was able to provide a lot of guidance
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
into some of the things we did with this
 
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
everybody on the division when we looked
 
00:41:56.329 --> 00:41:56.339 align:start position:0%
at the long extension said this needs to
 
00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
be changed that needs to be changed you
 
00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
have to work through every reference in
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
every RSA and it has to be changed to
 
00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
the new Department
 
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
what this is going to do and the
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate is a hundred percent
 
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
behind this as well as our own stne it
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
reorganizes and eliminates an ongoing
 
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
conflict with the puc the puc on one
 
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
hand has been a policy making unit and
 
00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
then on the other hand
 
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
they are quasi-judicial and they rule on
 
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
things that impact the ratepayer which
 
00:42:31.609 --> 00:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
is difficult I mean I can't imagine
 
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
writing a policy that impacts the great
 
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
fair having the rate payer talk to me
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
and say but this is hurting me and now I
 
00:42:40.609 --> 00:42:40.619 align:start position:0%
have to rule against my own policy it's
 
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
Department of energy will separate that
 
00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:45.020 align:start position:0%
out so the puc will remain
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
quasi-judicial but will no longer be
 
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
writing policy
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch came and their
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
budget was approved they did ask they
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
have an authorized amount of 45 judges
 
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
in the district court they had been
 
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
limited to 35 they asked to go to 37 we
 
00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:05.150 align:start position:0%
limited to 35 they asked to go to 37 we
agreed

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
we looked at hb2 sections we have rooms
 
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
and meals tax carry forward vet
 
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
and I can't thank again Ways and Means
 
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
enough for what they did for us Peter
 
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
leashman also worked on the organization
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
of the hb2 section that looks at the
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region facility and when he got
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
done with his work the division passed
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
that unanimously and we will look at
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
that could I ask LBA if maybe they could
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
bring up the our detail change at this
 
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
point and we can look at some of the
 
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
specifics in that is it possible to
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
share that on the screen
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
who's running the screen for us I can
 
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
call that up representative Ober thank
 
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
oh I think Mike Hoffman's got it oh good
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
you guys are just great
 
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so if we could go to
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
page one we're looking at division one
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
category one and you can see at the top
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
there aren't any changes and then if you
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
look in the middle of the page row 12
 
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology
 
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
additional funds for hardware and
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
software that had to be added because
 
00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:20.579 align:start position:0%
the parole board's funding for their new
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
digitization process had was not
 
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
accurate we also had
 
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
an impact of the DI of I.T on the
 
00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
department of energy they first started
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
and they put all of their money
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
scattered among the various Aus at the
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
last minute they wanted to consolidate
 
00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:40.140 align:start position:0%
them and we did that
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
you look at row 15 we had to transfer
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
from administrative services
 
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
and a way to pay the cost of cyber
 
00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
security which Das does the contract for
 
00:44:56.569 --> 00:44:56.579 align:start position:0%
gets but it extends it across to all of
 
00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
the agencies
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
and you'll find that there's a
 
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
in our packet of hb2 amendments on page
 
00:45:07.609 --> 00:45:07.619 align:start position:0%
six you will find the amendment that
 
00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
does that for the shared services
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
position that we put back
 
00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
under Department of administration
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
starting on line 18 if you look to the
 
00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
very far column with
 
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:20.990 align:start position:0%
very far column with
comments

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
you see consistently restores restores
 
00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:25.609 align:start position:0%
you see consistently restores restores
restores

00:45:25.609 --> 00:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
restores
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
I talked to you earlier about positions
 
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
that have been laid off we have added
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
back Staffing we did this without adding
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of costs because we found a couple
 
00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:37.619 align:start position:0%
of things number one
 
00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
Das had been over budgeted for
 
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:41.510 align:start position:0%
Das had been over budgeted for
maintenance

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
00:45:43.609 --> 00:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
to the tune of over six hundred thousand
 
00:45:43.619 --> 00:45:44.569 align:start position:0%
to the tune of over six hundred thousand
dollars

00:45:44.569 --> 00:45:44.579 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
they also have been charged for all the
 
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
cyber security which was over six
 
00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
and then remember I said we eliminated
 
00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.790 align:start position:0%
and then remember I said we eliminated
that

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
law enforcement commission that had been
 
00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
budgeted too early for them at five
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
hundred and seventeen thousand dollars
 
00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:05.339 align:start position:0%
we were up to almost 1.8 million dollars
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
in adjustments just in Das that added no
 
00:46:11.569 --> 00:46:11.579 align:start position:0%
money added no spending but allowed us
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
to make some changes that would benefit
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
the state as a whole and Mike if we
 
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:19.140 align:start position:0%
could go to the second page at the very
 
00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:20.210 align:start position:0%
could go to the second page at the very
top

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
top
 
00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:27.020 align:start position:0%
we have moved that from their budget
 
00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
one of the problems with the sheriff's
 
00:46:35.329 --> 00:46:35.339 align:start position:0%
reimbursements quite honestly has come
 
00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
from felonies first
 
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
when we didn't have felonies first
 
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
everything went through District Court
 
00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
District Court used video arraignments
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
in the jails the sheriffs did not
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
provide transportation they do not
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
provide security in the courthouses for
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
the prisoners the prisoners stayed in
 
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
the jails however with felonies first
 
00:46:59.690 --> 00:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court no longer would use
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
video arraignments
 
00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:04.460 align:start position:0%
the sheriff's now transported the
 
00:47:07.609 --> 00:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
prisoners and they provided Security in
 
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
the courthouses all day long while the
 
00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
prisoners were there in Hillsborough
 
00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
County this was a nightmare because
 
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
we're the only County with two Superior
 
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
Courts we did not have two bands to
 
00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
transport prisoners at the same time to
 
00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
the two different
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
courts when we started lost all the
 
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
video arraignment we had a lot of
 
00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
expense in Hillsborough County but it
 
00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:31.220 align:start position:0%
has added to the cost
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
judicial branch can best monitor that
 
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
cost Das had no idea and since the state
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
law says
 
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
they will be reimbursed up to the Limit
 
00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:44.220 align:start position:0%
that was budgeted that meant towards the
 
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
end of the year none of our County
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
budgets were getting the money they
 
00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
you can see that we
 
00:47:57.490 --> 00:47:57.500 align:start position:0%
had archives under the State Library
 
00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
some of the sources of the general funds
 
00:48:02.329 --> 00:48:02.339 align:start position:0%
had to be budgeted correctly this was
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
primary Errata that had to be redone
 
00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
although it was a lot of keen on the
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
part of LBA and I thank them again for
 
00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
not only getting the Amendments but
 
00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
getting the key and done
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
you move down to graphic Services we're
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
looking at line 32 and line 33.
 
00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
some of the people were laid off we have
 
00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
set up in hp2 a fund for them so that
 
00:48:26.329 --> 00:48:26.339 align:start position:0%
the money they earn will stay in that
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
fund and will pay for their people as it
 
00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
should and will no longer go to general
 
00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:34.030 align:start position:0%
should and will no longer go to general
fund

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
under the Property and Casualty
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
Insurance that's where you see the Das
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
change for the cyber security that I
 
00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board in Line 39 we
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
actually unfunded
 
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
three positions we looked at the law
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
that passed and they were allocated a
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
set amount of positions and suddenly in
 
00:48:59.809 --> 00:48:59.819 align:start position:0%
this budget they had three more
 
00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
positions than
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
allowed in the law so we unfunded them
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind we were trying to get to
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
the cuts that the chairman kept asking
 
00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
me for so the growth was above what was
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
passed in state law and they were
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely done the next line line 40
 
00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
reflects the 517 thousand dollars that
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
was removed from Das budget because it
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
was budgeted too soon you'll see when
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative umberger talks about
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
division two that they are working on
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
that as rightly so they should but we
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
also had it budgeted which was kind of a
 
00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.069 align:start position:0%
also had it budgeted which was kind of a
shock

00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
shock
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
so that was how we got part of our Cuts
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
if you can turn the page Mr Hoffman and
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
I'm at the top of the page with
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration I
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we added two Auditors
 
00:49:58.550 --> 00:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
which gained us three million dollars
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
at line 56 you will see that we have put
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
only one dollar in the governor's
 
00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund we used all of that
 
00:50:11.329 --> 00:50:11.339 align:start position:0%
money to fund Corrections vocational and
 
00:50:14.329 --> 00:50:14.339 align:start position:0%
academic training and we're going to we
 
00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
stood United as a Division behind those
 
00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:18.170 align:start position:0%
stood United as a Division behind those
cuts

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
cuts
 
00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
then if you go down to line 186
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
we have the office of professional
 
00:50:26.569 --> 00:50:26.579 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification
 
00:50:26.579 --> 00:50:27.650 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification
yeah

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
we have on page 29 House Bill 2 Section
 
00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:35.220 align:start position:0%
64 and 65 we abolished just an
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
established positions as they move
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
positions around to match the
 
00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.809 align:start position:0%
positions around to match the
reorganization

00:50:41.809 --> 00:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
reorganization
 
00:50:44.569 --> 00:50:44.579 align:start position:0%
page four is just summary Mr Hoffman if
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
we could go to page five
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch the Top Line you
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
will see the money to pay for the
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
prisoner transport and prisoner security
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
age 13 in our packet we have an
 
00:51:05.569 --> 00:51:05.579 align:start position:0%
amendment if you're looking at your hb2
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
packet as well we have an amendment that
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
eliminates 1.5 million dollars
 
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
and what that did we talked to military
 
00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.370 align:start position:0%
and what that did we talked to military
affairs

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
affairs
 
00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
they were funded 1.5 million dollars for
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
mental health services and instead there
 
00:51:23.569 --> 00:51:23.579 align:start position:0%
is an amendment that authorizes them and
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
talks to them about collaborating with
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
VA to participate with some of the Buddy
 
00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:32.220 align:start position:0%
programs and some of the PTSD and mental
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
health programs are our veterans have
 
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
over there plus we were aware by that
 
00:51:38.809 --> 00:51:38.819 align:start position:0%
time that although we wouldn't have the
 
00:51:41.569 --> 00:51:41.579 align:start position:0%
money during our budget cycle that there
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
was money in the coverage relief bill
 
00:51:47.329 --> 00:51:47.339 align:start position:0%
that Congress has asked to support this
 
00:51:50.329 --> 00:51:50.339 align:start position:0%
so although that was that was eliminated
 
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
they agreed that they were getting money
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
and that they would work with the VA and
 
00:51:56.089 --> 00:51:56.099 align:start position:0%
it was a good place to start they did
 
00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
get their two people to work on this
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
line seven and eight Department of
 
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
Agriculture we basically had no change
 
00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:03.950 align:start position:0%
Agriculture we basically had no change
except

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
except
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
consent calendar last time we passed a
 
00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:09.710 align:start position:0%
consent calendar last time we passed a
bill

00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
that went to Ways and Means because it
 
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
uses dedicated funds House Bill 532 to
 
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
create an animal records database
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
it was requested by the chairman of Vice
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
chairman of environment would this be
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
added to the budget and moved along the
 
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
Senate has a companion bill on this over
 
00:52:30.589 --> 00:52:30.599 align:start position:0%
on their side as well
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means was aware that we had it
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know if they retained it or not
 
00:52:37.609 --> 00:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
because they got it since it was
 
00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
dedicated funding
 
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:41.460 align:start position:0%
now in the Justice Department you can
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
see that we have delayed the start of
 
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
some of the attorney positions
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
we delayed the start because it does as
 
00:52:52.849 --> 00:52:52.859 align:start position:0%
you can see in FY 22 and FY 23 it does
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
give you a significant amount of cut
 
00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
when you're trying to cut 100 or 49
 
00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
million dollars but it does not cut the
 
00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:04.140 align:start position:0%
positions and this is a place where if
 
00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
the revenues continue to go up
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
and the revenue plan gets better it's
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
easy for the Senate to say well we're
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
move those forward because we don't need
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
you see on line 14 we have an amendment
 
00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:25.140 align:start position:0%
that deletes an appropriation to the frm
 
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
victims Recovery Fund this is Chairman
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
Wyler's bill
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
we have an hb2 section 76 and if you
 
00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
look at Pages 30 and 31 and on my hb2
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
packet you'll see the chairman Wyler
 
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
brought us an amendment that deleted the
 
00:53:45.049 --> 00:53:45.059 align:start position:0%
cuts but provided funding for the
 
00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
victims of this fund which the division
 
00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
put in I will tell you it was one of our
 
00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:53.339 align:start position:0%
few non-majority votes and we were 43 on
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
that but we added in into this
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
the hb2 packet at the very bottom of the
 
00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
page you see the banking Department
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
although there was no change in their
 
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
budget on page 58 we of hb2 packet we
 
00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
did add a new section
 
00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:13.740 align:start position:0%
talking about the deposit investment
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
pool this was at a request of the
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner who said that he frequently
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
found himself in a conflict where he
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
felt like he was working against the
 
00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
very people he was supposed to be
 
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
protecting he provided the language he
 
00:54:30.049 --> 00:54:30.059 align:start position:0%
explained the language and we added it
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
we have more Errata here
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
if you look at line 29 Department of
 
00:54:42.839 --> 00:54:45.049 align:start position:0%
if you look at line 29 Department of
Labor

00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:45.059 align:start position:0%
Labor
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
we had to change the source of fundings
 
00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
they just got keyed in the wrong line so
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
it was an erotic sheet that was easy to
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
do if you look at line 32
 
00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
you'll see we have a liquor and
 
00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.410 align:start position:0%
you'll see we have a liquor and
enforcement

00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:01.910 align:start position:0%
enforcement
Amendment

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
and this is found in the hb2 on pages 74
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
and 75.
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
Peter leishman look worked on the
 
00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:11.339 align:start position:0%
amendment you find in our packet on 77
 
00:55:15.049 --> 00:55:15.059 align:start position:0%
and 81. it basically eliminates 21 Law
 
00:55:17.569 --> 00:55:17.579 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers affected January 1
 
00:55:20.809 --> 00:55:20.819 align:start position:0%
2022 it renames the division of
 
00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:22.980 align:start position:0%
enforcement and Licensing and education
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
to the division of Licensing and
 
00:55:25.559 --> 00:55:26.930 align:start position:0%
to the division of Licensing and
education

00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
and as you can see it saves over 2.5
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
to store operations on line 33 was again
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
a mistake in Keene and it was an erotic
 
00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:41.339 align:start position:0%
sheet and we moved money from one place
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
to another no Financial impact
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
now we get down to the Department of
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
energy line 35.
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:58.849 --> 00:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
it came to us it had work it really
 
00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:01.740 align:start position:0%
needed quite a bit of reorganization and
 
00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget director needs to
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
be credited for for working with us at
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
one point in time representative walls
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
asked if she could work with him on an
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
amendment and she sent him some changes
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
that were incorporated into the
 
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
amendment I didn't see the changes she
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
sent but I did see a result of the work
 
00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:21.900 align:start position:0%
that was put together we also had to
 
00:56:24.829 --> 00:56:24.839 align:start position:0%
move as I said earlier all of their I.T
 
00:56:29.329 --> 00:56:29.339 align:start position:0%
funds back and forth line 41 we switched
 
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
positions from one account to another
 
00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.770 align:start position:0%
positions from one account to another
account

00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
we move funds again renewable energy
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
fund on line 43 out of class 47 to
 
00:56:43.849 --> 00:56:43.859 align:start position:0%
consolidate the transfers Mike if you
 
00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:47.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
we have administrative support consumer
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
Advocate and the site evaluation
 
00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
committee a couple of things happened on
 
00:56:57.530 --> 00:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee last
 
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
biennium they were given an HP one
 
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
footnote that said in the event the
 
00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:05.220 align:start position:0%
expenditures in either fiscal year in
 
00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit are greater than
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
application fees and filing fees held in
 
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation Committee Fund the
 
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:14.220 align:start position:0%
chairman of the site evaluation
 
00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
committee May request with prior
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
approval of the fiscal committee that
 
00:57:20.329 --> 00:57:20.339 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council authorize
 
00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:23.700 align:start position:0%
additional funding that did not happen
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
she ignored that she needed to get prior
 
00:57:29.089 --> 00:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
approval and on two separate occasions
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
she brought to fiscal committee rather
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
large bills that she had already spent
 
00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
the dollars and said well you have to
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
fund these because we spent the money we
 
00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
were fiscally conservative but we didn't
 
00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
ask you for permission like where it was
 
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
supposed to so we thought we would
 
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:46.140 align:start position:0%
eliminate that this time and let them
 
00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:49.940 align:start position:0%
work on this we also unfunded the vacant
 
00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
this was a lot of effort I would like to
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank the committee for working through
 
00:57:59.160 --> 00:57:59.930 align:start position:0%
thank the committee for working through
it

00:57:59.930 --> 00:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:58:03.170 --> 00:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
going to move that now to page 53 I mean
 
00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:05.220 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry line 53 Department of
 
00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:08.930 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry line 53 Department of
Corrections

00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.809 --> 00:58:11.819 align:start position:0%
in line 54 we delayed the start of the
 
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
unclassified chairman by six months
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
so she is going to remain as she is
 
00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
until we get into the biennium so it's a
 
00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
six-month push of that
 
00:58:26.569 --> 00:58:26.579 align:start position:0%
the parole board
 
00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
we increase the funds in class 27 as you
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
can see by the amount because we did not
 
00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
get the hardware and the networking and
 
00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
the software charges until the very last
 
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
day that we were working
 
00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:41.700 align:start position:0%
this is something we've been talking
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
about since November but it took a
 
00:58:47.809 --> 00:58:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
you can see then 56 57
 
00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:54.589 align:start position:0%
you can see then 56 57
58.

00:58:54.589 --> 00:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
58.
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
where we put back in the transitional
 
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
housing for Shea Farm Calumet in
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
Manchester and then we moved
 
00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:07.140 align:start position:0%
all of the Appropriations in order to
 
00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
let them move so we now have
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
transitional housing when you turn the
 
00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
page you see the rest of the impact
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman page eight thank you at the
 
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
top of the page to restore the operating
 
00:59:23.410 --> 00:59:23.420 align:start position:0%
costs and the program coordinator
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
transfer positions back
 
00:59:28.849 --> 00:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
for the transitional housing restores
 
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
the operating costs for the Calumet
 
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:39.660 align:start position:0%

00:59:44.329 --> 00:59:44.339 align:start position:0%
while the budget has no change
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
page 72 in our hb2 packet
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
and there's a new section on fraud
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
Mr labors came and he talked to us
 
00:59:56.809 --> 00:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
extensively about this and we put in
 
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
this section I know you've read the
 
01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
newspapers about fraud in the
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
unemployment claims he felt that this
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
was needed the committee supported him
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman if I can go to page nine at
 
01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
this point I'd be ever so happy thank
 
01:00:11.819 --> 01:00:13.970 align:start position:0%
this point I'd be ever so happy thank
you

01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
um Economic Development Administration
 
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
we unfunded a vacant position and pushed
 
01:00:23.809 --> 01:00:23.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:27.299 align:start position:0%
again it added to our cuts
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
on the line four you see where we
 
01:00:32.089 --> 01:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
restored the funding to the small
 
01:00:32.099 --> 01:00:33.410 align:start position:0%
restored the funding to the small
business

01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
Development Center now keep in mind in
 
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 there was already fifty
 
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars budgeted so in that
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
line item in each of those two years
 
01:00:44.569 --> 01:00:44.579 align:start position:0%
they will get two hundred and twenty
 
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
and we took that money as I said earlier
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
from the division of Tourism and travel
 
01:00:53.569 --> 01:00:53.579 align:start position:0%
which you see on line five
 
01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
you get now down to page line seven
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.430 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
resources

01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
although we made no change to their hb2
 
01:01:04.319 --> 01:01:05.510 align:start position:0%
although we made no change to their hb2
funding

01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
there were over two million dollars
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
worth of parks
 
01:01:10.079 --> 01:01:12.349 align:start position:0%
worth of parks
improvements

01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
improvements
 
01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
and if you look at page 53 in our hb2
 
01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:17.390 align:start position:0%
and if you look at page 53 in our hb2
packet

01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
packet
 
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
you will see that we have redone section
 
01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.490 align:start position:0%
you will see that we have redone section
142.

01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
142.
 
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
we cut that in half
 
01:01:26.809 --> 01:01:26.819 align:start position:0%
so we left new campgrounds for Jericho
 
01:01:29.410 --> 01:01:29.420 align:start position:0%
we met left a new
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
electrical panel because the old one
 
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
will not support the campers that are
 
01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:34.970 align:start position:0%
will not support the campers that are
coming

01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
and we said we're going to have to
 
01:01:40.849 --> 01:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
eliminate the other three projects
 
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
since then in discussions with the
 
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
governor's budget director
 
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
chairman Weiler and I have both learned
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
that there is additional money for Parks
 
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
improvements in the covid bill that has
 
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
passed so what I'm expecting some of
 
01:01:57.530 --> 01:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
those will be funded there and then the
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services on
 
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
line 11
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
talks again about suspension of the
 
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
state aid grants refers you to page 19
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
in our packet which is section 60 that
 
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
provides the Des commissioner with the
 
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
ability to request additional
 
01:02:17.809 --> 01:02:17.819 align:start position:0%
Appropriations if General funds exceed
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
revenue the intent was to make it very
 
01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:25.140 align:start position:0%
clear that the legislative legislature
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
supported these programs but that gave
 
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
us the biggest amount of cuts that we
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
could make to support the efforts that
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
need to be done in division two whereas
 
01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
the chairman had told me they did not
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
think they could make any Cuts so we
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
reluctantly did that but we did meet
 
01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:49.859 align:start position:0%
um the needs of everybody I think in all
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
three divisions
 
01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
there are a few sections in hb2 packet
 
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
that I haven't touched on so I'm going
 
01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
to go to page 18 which is a new section
 
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
and it basically
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
creates a pathway for corrections
 
01:03:07.609 --> 01:03:07.619 align:start position:0%
employees who've been group two
 
01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
retirement to be considered for
 
01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
promotions without losing their group
 
01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
two benefits
 
01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
and what it does oh Mike thanks for
 
01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
bringing that up that's great
 
01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:20.750 align:start position:0%
bringing that up that's great
um

01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
you can see in line 6 through 11 you
 
01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
have some titles who have to have been
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
with corrections at least 15 years prior
 
01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
to the appointment in the position in
 
01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
order to remain in group two status and
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
in lines 12 through 17 some of the
 
01:03:41.809 --> 01:03:41.819 align:start position:0%
positions need to be at least 10 years
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
line 16 prior to the appointment in the
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
position if they do that they can create
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
they can retain their group two benefits
 
01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
commissioner said this would help her
 
01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
greatly in retaining some of her senior
 
01:03:59.569 --> 01:03:59.579 align:start position:0%
more valuable people the division talked
 
01:04:02.329 --> 01:04:02.339 align:start position:0%
about it we voted this in unanimously
 
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
Mike if you go to page 33 which is
 
01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
sections 102 and 105.
 
01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
we're so I'm sorry Norm is not here but
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
this is the business profits tax credit
 
01:04:13.319 --> 01:04:14.750 align:start position:0%
this is the business profits tax credit
forward

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
this came from the governor
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
ways it means unanimously looked at this
 
01:04:21.839 --> 01:04:22.970 align:start position:0%
ways it means unanimously looked at this
amendment

01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
worked on it and it was given to us to
 
01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
put in to replace the sections that have
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
been in hb2
 
01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
represent major and representative Rami
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
said that the their committee
 
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
unanimously felt this was The Prudent
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
way to move forward with this
 
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
carry forward limited payments
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
helps the state get on a more even
 
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.130 align:start position:0%
helps the state get on a more even
footing

01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
footing
 
01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin who is a CPA and
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
is on division one said this is being
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
carry forward limits because it is
 
01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
impacting the state overall financially
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
when you go to page 35 Mike that's
 
01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
sections 114 and 1 15.
 
01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:13.980 align:start position:0%
yeah this these two sections came from
 
01:05:16.849 --> 01:05:16.859 align:start position:0%
BFA and we don't look at their budget
 
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
and one of the sections actually had an
 
01:05:23.089 --> 01:05:23.099 align:start position:0%
effective date of May 2021 and the BFA
 
01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
director was a little surprised to learn
 
01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
that hb1 and hb2 didn't take effect
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
until July 1st so it was recommended and
 
01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:34.140 align:start position:0%
I did talk to the governor's budget
 
01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:37.140 align:start position:0%
director that they find a bill with
 
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
money perhaps in the senate or they
 
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
could attach those on and meet the May
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
implementation date that was needed
 
01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
you're looking at page 39 we have
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
section 124
 
01:05:55.010 --> 01:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
which deleted the proposal to promote
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
the executive assistant to a
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
non-classified position this is
 
01:06:01.849 --> 01:06:01.859 align:start position:0%
something that should really run through
 
01:06:04.849 --> 01:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
on a bill and have a job description
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
ready to go over so they had a little
 
01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:13.619 align:start position:0%
work to look at it page 40 section 127
 
01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
is really an erratic change this is
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
exactly what came to us in hp2 with one
 
01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
exception at the end of line six and
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
thanks to Nancy levinas for having
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
caught this such per diem shall be
 
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
prorated to an hourly rate for other
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
related work performed by board members
 
01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:33.299 align:start position:0%
that is new language it should have been
 
01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
bold in nhb2 it was not Nancy Eagle I
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
labinos caught that and this amendment
 
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
all right Mike if we can go to page 44
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
sections 128
 
01:06:54.289 --> 01:06:54.299 align:start position:0%
. these were deleted at the request of
 
01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:00.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
I guess they didn't need them I really
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
don't know what we what was needed
 
01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.069 align:start position:0%
don't know what we what was needed
um

01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
we have page section 292 page 46.
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
this is a section that is shared by
 
01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
every Division and LBA goes through and
 
01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:20.839 align:start position:0%
makes sure that all the effective dates
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
are really effective
 
01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
so you'll see this with all three
 
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
divisions these are the changes that
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
were needed for what we did and I thank
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
Nancy for doing that
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
if you go to Pages 60 to 65 this is a
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
ways and means request that came from
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
the chair and the vice chair and it adds
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
the historical racing back into
 
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
hb2 and again we had some discussion on
 
01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
this the division vote on adding
 
01:07:58.250 --> 01:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
historical racing was six to one so we
 
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
were not we were unanimous a lot of the
 
01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
time but we were not unanimous here this
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
is a bill that came has my name on it
 
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
but the bills and Ways and Means came
 
01:08:11.329 --> 01:08:11.339 align:start position:0%
out of ways and means and Patrick abrami
 
01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:13.980 align:start position:0%
provided the language even though it has
 
01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
my name on it so it talks about the
 
01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
historical racing and goes the money
 
01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
would go to the Lottery Commission so
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
this is a gain in Revenue that division
 
01:08:26.209 --> 01:08:26.219 align:start position:0%
one was happy to put in for division two
 
01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
but we didn't get any credit for it
 
01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
against what we're trying to cut
 
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
Mike if you can bring up the pages 66 to
 
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
71 these are all the ways and means
 
01:08:41.169 --> 01:08:41.179 align:start position:0%
approved sections on the BET
 
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
and again Ways and Means worked on these
 
01:08:47.809 --> 01:08:47.819 align:start position:0%
the commitments in my name but I can't
 
01:08:49.849 --> 01:08:49.859 align:start position:0%
take any credit for it it was just
 
01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
something given to me that needed to be
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
put in to be corrected with what was
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:58.799 --> 01:09:00.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
Mike if you can bring up Pages 82 to 86
 
01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
this is the verbiage for
 
01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:13.259 align:start position:0%
House Bill 544 this came at a request of
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
the leadership of our caucus again has
 
01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
my name on it but I was asked to put it
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
in I think you've all have read it we're
 
01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
getting a lot of email about it
 
01:09:26.809 --> 01:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
if we can go to page 87
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
which is house bill
 
01:09:29.759 --> 01:09:31.789 align:start position:0%
which is house bill
63.

01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
63.
 
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
and basically as you see this basically
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
this says this day recognizes that
 
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
multiple executive orders may have
 
01:09:41.809 --> 01:09:41.819 align:start position:0%
created a new hardship or confusion we
 
01:09:44.689 --> 01:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
have about ten thousand dollars in fines
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
outstanding this authorizes those to be
 
01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.829 align:start position:0%
outstanding this authorizes those to be
paid

01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.839 --> 01:09:52.789 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
it also lets the business who went to
 
01:09:59.330 --> 01:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
court go back to court and have things
 
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
annulled if they sell shoes
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
Mike if you could bring up the um
 
01:10:09.169 --> 01:10:09.179 align:start position:0%
Family Leave Amendment which oh let me
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
give you the page on that I didn't I
 
01:10:13.729 --> 01:10:13.739 align:start position:0%
didn't write down that page
 
01:10:13.739 --> 01:10:14.930 align:start position:0%
didn't write down that page
um

01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%

this is amended from what the governor
did

01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
and basically this bill says and
 
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
we move the dates so everything else
 
01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
medical is going to be open to everybody
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
it is optional it is not mandatory
 
01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
it can be used for only the following
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
regions the birth or adoption of a child
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
or a serious health issue of a family
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
member permitted under the federal
 
01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
Family and Medical Leave Act
 
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
if your company oh offer short-term
 
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
disability you must take your short-term
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
disability before you can apply the
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
family leave you can only apply for
 
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
Family Leave once a year you can take
 
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
only up to you don't have to take all of
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
it but up to six weeks at sixty percent
 
01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.149 align:start position:0%
it but up to six weeks at sixty percent
pay

01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
pay
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
again after your short-term disability
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
the governor proposes making this a
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
benefit for state employees who are
 
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
eligible for benefits there's a state
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
law that says you have to be working 30
 
01:11:30.850 --> 01:11:30.860 align:start position:0%
hours a week to be eligible for benefits
 
01:11:34.130 --> 01:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
I've heard a lobbyist has said we don't
 
01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
have the people to run this well that's
 
01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
actually not true because Das has an
 
01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
insurance group that already runs all of
 
01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
the benefits that go to our state
 
01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.169 align:start position:0%
the benefits that go to our state
employees

01:11:45.169 --> 01:11:45.179 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
Medical Dental workers comp all the
 
01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
things runs through this Das Insurance
 
01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:52.189 align:start position:0%
things runs through this Das Insurance
Group

01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
Group
 
01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
this says that the state will have an
 
01:11:58.729 --> 01:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
RFP written and they will have private
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
insurance companies respond to it the
 
01:12:03.010 --> 01:12:03.020 align:start position:0%
governor told us 11 private insurance
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
companies have already made queries for
 
01:12:09.229 --> 01:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
responding and again Das has a contract
 
01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:12.900 align:start position:0%
group they do rfps
 
01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
if you are not a state employee your
 
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
business May piggyback on this if your
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
business chooses not to piggyback on
 
01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
this you may as an individual
 
01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
contributor sign up and have family
 
01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:26.870 align:start position:0%
contributor sign up and have family
leave

01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
leave
 
01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
okay reasonable
 
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
yeah I have an amendment in at the
 
01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:32.890 align:start position:0%
yeah I have an amendment in at the
request

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:32.900 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
caucus to remove this section
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going through these now as requested
 
01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
to go through what's in the budget and I
 
01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
know you have an amendment
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
but I thought
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
I should talk about the information in
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
here and then you can talk about your
 
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.090 align:start position:0%
here and then you can talk about your
Amendment

01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:53.570 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:56.810 --> 01:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
we did two things with this we push it
 
01:12:58.850 --> 01:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
so it took effect the last six months in
 
01:13:00.649 --> 01:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
the biennium
 
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
and the other thing we did if you're an
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
individual contributor and you take your
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
five dollars as it came from a governor
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
it said
 
01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.430 align:start position:0%
it said
that

01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
your business would deduct the five
 
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
dollars in payche in the insurance
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
company and we told the governors budget
 
01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
director we were not going to do this
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
each of us pays for our own car
 
01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
insurance so certainly if you decide to
 
01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
take fmli you can afford to pay your
 
01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
insurance bill for your fmly
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
so we did not include
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that they had to do it
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
much of the hb2 that came to us which
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
you've had for months stayed the same
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
that we looked at I have hit the things
 
01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
we have deleted with one exception and I
 
01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
would ask Mike Kane if he could do this
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
Mike we had a new
 
01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
on Section 227 which was on the bill
 
01:13:57.530 --> 01:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
page 105 but is an amendment in our hb2
 
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
packet of 57 the site evaluation
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
committee membership we had voted that
 
01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
long before the rest of the Department
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
of energy stuff got done and this
 
01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
amendment should be withdrawn and is not
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
needed because it was overwritten by a
 
01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
subsequent vote it is still in the
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
packets and I assume you can make that
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
note somehow
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
yes we will make that note
 
01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
representative in Mike Hoffman uh we'll
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that the intent of that
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
division of the division is reflected
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Kane thank you Mr Hopper
 
01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
all right Mr chairman that concludes my
 
01:14:35.630 --> 01:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
presentation and yes I knew you had an
 
01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
amendment you noticed I put family leave
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
last in case you wanted to submit your
 
01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment next
 
01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
I'll bring that up later but great job
 
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
good work for division one I'm glad you
 
01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
had so much cooperation from your
 
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
members are there any questions from the
 
01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
committee for representative over on the
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
presentation she has just made
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
a representative leishman
 
01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman I would just like to
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
point out that I will be supporting the
 
01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
work of division one today the chair was
 
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
correct the commission was very closely
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
uh I know I speak to my Democratic
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
colleagues that we really appreciate the
 
01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
support and collaboration from our
 
01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
Republican colleagues there are a few
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
things that I'm not happy with but I
 
01:15:29.330 --> 01:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
recognize this is second base if you
 
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
will of doing it for six terms I finally
 
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
figured that out but
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things that is troubling is
 
01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 533
 
01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:44.580 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry 544 which we've already
 
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
received a great deal of the email and
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
call us from I certainly support the
 
01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
governor it has announced it the other
 
01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:53.580 align:start position:0%
day that he would be total any sort of
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
legislation similar to this war House
 
01:15:59.930 --> 01:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
Bill 544 so I'm hopeful that this
 
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't come out in the final package
 
01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
but Mr chairman I want to thank the
 
01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:07.980 align:start position:0%

I cannot support it there's uh one thing
 
01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
I had a lot of issues with is the
 
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
um it didn't belong in a budget bill
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
there's a it's a it's a gigantic change
 
01:17:17.209 --> 01:17:17.219 align:start position:0%
administrative change within state
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
government it impacts multiple
 
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
departments and there's a lot of things
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
in that that are concerning and one one
 
01:17:26.450 --> 01:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
thing that's
 
01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:27.290 align:start position:0%
thing that's
um

01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:27.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
really roused my attention is many times
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
the individuals from the governor's
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
office that introduced this to us would
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
refer to the fact that that could be
 
01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
addressed in rules and administrative
 
01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
rules these are things that are lacking
 
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
within that that haven't been corrected
 
01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
and aren't going to be corrected and
 
01:17:48.649 --> 01:17:48.659 align:start position:0%
just just to know having been on
 
01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
administrative rules for many years
 
01:17:53.209 --> 01:17:53.219 align:start position:0%
having been a past chair of that
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
um that's not how it works we do not
 
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
legislate in administrative rules and
 
01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
and it's uh problematic and what happens
 
01:18:05.209 --> 01:18:05.219 align:start position:0%
often is before we can even address
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
something it needs the legislative fits
 
01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
and that would be applicable here and
 
01:18:13.630 --> 01:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh undoubtedly a good thing
 
01:18:16.729 --> 01:18:16.739 align:start position:0%
going forward the concept of it I
 
01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
support that it's obviously needed I
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
support that but this is really not the
 
01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
way to do it and it and it doesn't
 
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
belong here and I'm very concerned about
 
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
the way it's done so that's just one of
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
the reasons why I can't support that
 
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
um there's there's a few other things
 
01:18:37.729 --> 01:18:37.739 align:start position:0%
um uh a few of the tax reductions I
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
can't support
 
01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
um it's funds that are needed
 
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
um they really
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
support the many very necessary
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
activities that we do as a state
 
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
government for our citizens three in
 
01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
deductive funds from that they can't be
 
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
accomplished so anyways again I just
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
want to thank the chair for her efforts
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
my colleagues on the committee both
 
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle I I appreciate their
 
01:19:05.570 --> 01:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
efforts very much but I I just I'm sorry
 
01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
I can't support this thank you Mr chair
 
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
hatch this I'm just tweaking that needs
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
to happen with the energy office
 
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
hopefully you can inform the Senate and
 
01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps they will take up your advice
 
01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:20.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
I see a representative walls has her
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:27.530 align:start position:0%
hand up
representative

01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
um I too worked hard on this with
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
everybody else and I think that there's
 
01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of good things that were done in
 
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
hb1 I'm sorry in division one but I
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
cannot support this and for some of the
 
01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
reasons that were enumerated by
 
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative hatch
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
um without repeating a lot of them I
 
01:19:47.090 --> 01:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
also have some additional issues with
 
01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:48.290 align:start position:0%
also have some additional issues with
this

01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:48.300 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
um the problem I see with the Department
 
01:19:52.610 --> 01:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
of energy is it did not have a public
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
hearing it did not go through a
 
01:19:57.169 --> 01:19:57.179 align:start position:0%
committee there's a lot of structural
 
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
flaws with it the movement of positions
 
01:20:02.689 --> 01:20:02.699 align:start position:0%
from the puc to the Department of energy
 
01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
effectively eviscerates the Public
 
01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
Utility Commission and means that it
 
01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
will not be a well-functioning agency
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
we've had a well-functioning puc for a
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
long time we only need to look at places
 
01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
like California Texas and Massachusetts
 
01:20:19.610 --> 01:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
where they've had huge utility problems
 
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
where they've had inadequate regulation
 
01:20:25.010 --> 01:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
to see what eviscerating the puc could
 
01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
potentially do to our state and I'm very
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
concerned by the flaws that continue to
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
exist in the bill creating the
 
01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:34.860 align:start position:0%
department of energy I agree overall
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea but the devil is in the
 
01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
details and I don't think that this is
 
01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
well executed as it stands now
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
I also have problems with uh with the
 
01:20:48.169 --> 01:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
iteration of House Bill 544 in here and
 
01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
has no business being in our laws
 
01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
anywhere much less in here
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
um I have problems with the tax
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
reductions we as representative Roger
 
01:20:59.570 --> 01:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
just went through and explained all the
 
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
places we are scrambling trying to find
 
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
Revenue it makes no sense to me to be
 
01:21:05.450 --> 01:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
cutting our revenue and cutting
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
ourselves off at the knees so I cannot
 
01:21:10.610 --> 01:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
support the tax cuts in here I cannot
 
01:21:12.649 --> 01:21:12.659 align:start position:0%
support sending the money that's in here
 
01:21:17.090 --> 01:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
to frm I mean for frm it was really a
 
01:21:19.490 --> 01:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
group of people who chose to gamble with
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
their money didn't do their due
 
01:21:22.610 --> 01:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
diligence and now they want to use
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars to pay them back for
 
01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
their own Gamble and I cannot support
 
01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:28.189 align:start position:0%
their own Gamble and I cannot support
that

01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:28.199 --> 01:21:28.750 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
and finally I am appalled by the way
 
01:21:34.130 --> 01:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
historic racing has been snuck in here
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
as well and has no business being in
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
here it's a bill that was defeated the
 
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
last well defeated once and tabled again
 
01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
but stopped the last two years in the
 
01:21:44.810 --> 01:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
session it was brought in at the 11th
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
hour with no debate and no discussion
 
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
and I think it's very poor public policy
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons among others I am
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to vote in favor of
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
our division one budget
 
01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.090 --> 01:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
uh representative I really want to make
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I think you're going to find
 
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
that we worked well together
 
01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
every budget has got things in it they
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
don't like I mean people hear me talk
 
01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.070 align:start position:0%
don't like I mean people hear me talk
about

01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:21.179 align:start position:0%
the over budget at home somehow the over
 
01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
budget never funds the car I want to
 
01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
drive but we still go forth you have to
 
01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
pick and choose what you're going to do
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
I am going to support the budget I plan
 
01:22:32.689 --> 01:22:32.699 align:start position:0%
to support the work of division two and
 
01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
three as well and I'd like to thank all
 
01:22:37.970 --> 01:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
seven members of the division including
 
01:22:39.649 --> 01:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
myself for the hard work because we
 
01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
really did work hard thank you Mr
 
01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:43.610 align:start position:0%
really did work hard thank you Mr
chairman

01:22:43.610 --> 01:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
you representative over
 
01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
now the way I'd like to do this now is
 
01:22:52.370 --> 01:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
to have us vote on a report given by
 
01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
division one to see which members will
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
support the changes and I I was going to
 
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
do just hb1 but since she reported both
 
01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
hb1 and hb2 we will take separate votes
 
01:23:07.010 --> 01:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to ask us first to vote on
 
01:23:10.189 --> 01:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
the the division one actions on HP one
 
01:23:11.810 --> 01:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
and then we'll vote separately on
 
01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
division actions on hb2 the clerk will
 
01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
call the roll when he's ready on the
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
committee's response to support or
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
non-support uh division ones activities
 
01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:26.300 align:start position:0%
on hb1 for the first vote
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:40.610 --> 01:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:42.770 --> 01:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
I will and I'm sure representative
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:52.669 --> 01:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
to accept the committee work on hb1 and
 
01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
representative Emrick seconds
 
01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:59.510 align:start position:0%
representative Emrick seconds

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.629 align:start position:0%
for uh all of their hard work
and

01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
um we were in a situation where
 
01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately representative Daniels
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
not able was not able to join us and
 
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
um as a result uh representative
 
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
turcotte joined us late in the
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
in the budget process but uh has done a
 
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
wonderful job
 
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
I would say that uh out of our
 
01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:36.649 align:start position:0%
I would say that uh out of our
um

01:28:36.649 --> 01:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:41.930 --> 01:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
committee that probably 98 of our votes
 
01:28:44.689 --> 01:28:44.699 align:start position:0%
were 7-0
 
01:28:44.699 --> 01:28:46.189 align:start position:0%
were 7-0
which

01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:28:46.199 --> 01:28:47.110 align:start position:0%
which
um

01:28:47.110 --> 01:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
which as we were walking through each of
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
these areas uh I think that um we tried
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
to compromise we tried to uh make sure
 
01:29:04.490 --> 01:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
that uh everyone that wanted to say how
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
to say and I truly appreciate all of the
 
01:29:12.649 --> 01:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
uh all of the hard work that that
 
01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:21.530 --> 01:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
so if we turn to hb1
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
you'll notice the uh Mickey maybe maybe
 
01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
you could bring up the page to help
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
I think everyone in the room has
 
01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
a copy right
 
01:29:36.890 --> 01:29:36.900 align:start position:0%
so if if we
 
01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:38.590 align:start position:0%
so if if we
oh

01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay is that better thank you
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%

01:29:50.689 --> 01:29:50.699 align:start position:0%
the items that are identified there are
 
01:29:53.209 --> 01:29:53.219 align:start position:0%
a result of
 
01:29:56.689 --> 01:29:56.699 align:start position:0%
budget entry Corrections that were
 
01:29:58.970 --> 01:29:58.980 align:start position:0%

01:30:15.770 --> 01:30:15.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry lows 42 and 40 43. this
 
01:30:19.850 --> 01:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
is funding uh required to meet demand in
 
01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
the uh forensic lab
 
01:30:27.290 --> 01:30:27.300 align:start position:0%
and uh we felt very strongly that we did
 
01:30:29.570 --> 01:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
not need to go back
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
to the point where our forensic lab was
 
01:30:36.290 --> 01:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
not uh fully well was not funded at a
 
01:30:39.490 --> 01:30:39.500 align:start position:0%
level that was appropriate
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative Ober had talked about
 
01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:45.290 align:start position:0%

01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:47.330 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:48.770 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:30:48.770 --> 01:30:48.780 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
body worn and dashboard camera fund
 
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
which had originally allocated
 
01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:00.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry wrong wrong one the uh the
 
01:31:03.729 --> 01:31:03.739 align:start position:0%
body worn and dashboard camera
 
01:31:08.689 --> 01:31:08.699 align:start position:0%
uh authorized a million dollars for uh
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
for this to um and this is money that
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
the individual police departments will
 
01:31:19.370 --> 01:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
be able to come into uh safety to
 
01:31:24.050 --> 01:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
request support for the um body
 
01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:25.390 align:start position:0%
request support for the um body
uh

01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
cameras and the uh dashboard cameras and
 
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
this was uh one of those items that was
 
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
recommended out of the liac commission
 
01:31:42.050 --> 01:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
and what we basically did here is
 
01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
um that we uh established a business
 
01:31:51.169 --> 01:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
administrator position one to uh monitor
 
01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
or to
 
01:31:58.510 --> 01:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
to um make this program work and um
 
01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
what line is that
 
01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:02.229 align:start position:0%
what line is that
um

01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:06.649 --> 01:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
46. okay I'm sorry 46
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
okay so that was uh basically as I said
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:20.110 align:start position:0%
all of the
um

01:32:20.110 --> 01:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:24.770 --> 01:32:24.780 align:start position:0%
areas that uh we changed in safety in
 
01:32:29.209 --> 01:32:29.219 align:start position:0%
hb1 were basically a result of things
 
01:32:33.169 --> 01:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
that that safety needed and I will be
 
01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
discussing several other changes in
 
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:46.490 --> 01:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh this is the first time in
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
16 years I guess that uh fish and game
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
uh they've they've been healthy
 
01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:05.090 align:start position:0%
uh they've they've been healthy
um

01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:07.729 --> 01:33:07.739 align:start position:0%
I had always we had always had to
 
01:33:10.490 --> 01:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
transfer money to fish and game just so
 
01:33:13.610 --> 01:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
they could uh could operate
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
but you will notice
 
01:33:18.649 --> 01:33:18.659 align:start position:0%
um the only thing that we did or changed
 
01:33:22.490 --> 01:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
in uh in fish and game was uh funding
 
01:33:24.250 --> 01:33:24.260 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
supervisory Hatchery manager and
 
01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
otherwise finishing game remain the same
 
01:33:38.090 --> 01:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately unlike the fish and game
 
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
fund the highway fund is in uh has
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
significant problems in funding the
 
01:33:57.290 --> 01:33:57.300 align:start position:0%
things that that we need to fund to keep
 
01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
our highways Bridges roads uh in good
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
condition as well as
 
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
maintaining uh winter maintenance which
 
01:34:13.370 --> 01:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
is uh which is always a problem
 
01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:14.689 align:start position:0%
is uh which is always a problem
so

01:34:14.689 --> 01:34:14.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:14.699 --> 01:34:15.490 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:34:15.490 --> 01:34:15.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
basically again all of these uh items
 
01:34:25.729 --> 01:34:25.739 align:start position:0%
were cuts that needed to be made in
 
01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
order to balance the highway fund
 
01:34:33.169 --> 01:34:33.179 align:start position:0%
and we will be talking about what we
 
01:34:37.550 --> 01:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
have done to add money back into the
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
highway fund at a later point
 
01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:41.629 align:start position:0%
highway fund at a later point
but

01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
um this is uh this was very hard on
 
01:34:50.510 --> 01:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
every single one of us to think about
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
um cutting the the highway fund and I
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
will also mention
 
01:35:00.169 --> 01:35:00.179 align:start position:0%
uh that um that if you look at
 
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
apportionment A and B the cut that was
 
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
uh needed there that uh that is part of
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
that is for uh the towns and cities the
 
01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
money that they receive for
 
01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
um roads and bridges in the towns
 
01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
but wait till we get to hb2 okay before
 
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
you before we get to carried away with
 
01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:27.950 align:start position:0%
you before we get to carried away with
that

01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:31.729 --> 01:35:31.739 align:start position:0%
so that's the highway fund uh at one
 
01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
point I think we ended up with
 
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
3.86 left in the highway fund I'm just
 
01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:42.350 align:start position:0%
3.86 left in the highway fund I'm just
kidding

01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:46.010 --> 01:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
close okay so um
 
01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
but we've done some things in hb2 that
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
you will that will affect what's going
 
01:35:57.229 --> 01:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:02.350 --> 01:36:02.360 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education
 
01:36:06.490 --> 01:36:06.500 align:start position:0%
uh had a couple of changes
 
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
uh the first one is in education
 
01:36:10.199 --> 01:36:11.930 align:start position:0%
uh the first one is in education
credentialing

01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
credentialing
 
01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
and this is agency income
 
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
and so there's no effect on uh general
 
01:36:21.649 --> 01:36:21.659 align:start position:0%
fund or the education trust fund and
 
01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
they requested
 
01:36:27.169 --> 01:36:27.179 align:start position:0%
um that they add a position and because
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
the income was such that they could that
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
we agreed to that
 
01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh robotics education fund had been
 
01:36:41.709 --> 01:36:41.719 align:start position:0%
funded by the governor at zero
 
01:36:41.719 --> 01:36:43.490 align:start position:0%
funded by the governor at zero
and

01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:48.050 --> 01:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
um we replaced the robotics program or
 
01:36:50.350 --> 01:36:50.360 align:start position:0%
we added to the robotics program
 
01:36:54.770 --> 01:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh the 1.5 million which is what they
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
had had in the past and I will say that
 
01:37:00.189 --> 01:37:00.199 align:start position:0%
this is probably
 
01:37:04.850 --> 01:37:04.860 align:start position:0%
one of the most wonderful programs for
 
01:37:09.169 --> 01:37:09.179 align:start position:0%
our high school students primarily and I
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:19.610 --> 01:37:19.620 align:start position:0%
okay uh our next line
 
01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
is also a
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
a transfer from
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
other agencies the first one is a
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
anticipated Grant from Alcohol and Other
 
01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
Drugs and the uh
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
the second one
 
01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:41.750 align:start position:0%
the second one
is

01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
um is in again
 
01:37:48.590 --> 01:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
what the uh what the doe came in with uh
 
01:37:55.490 --> 01:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
was not
 
01:38:00.110 --> 01:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
um sufficient to cover all of the uh
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh special education requirements
 
01:38:12.169 --> 01:38:12.179 align:start position:0%
and um because we were able to obtain
 
01:38:12.179 --> 01:38:14.930 align:start position:0%
and um because we were able to obtain
some

01:38:14.930 --> 01:38:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:16.850 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:38:16.850 --> 01:38:16.860 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:20.209 --> 01:38:20.219 align:start position:0%
General funds through some things that
 
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss in hb2 we are now able to
 
01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:25.550 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss in hb2 we are now able to
fund

01:38:25.550 --> 01:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:38:29.930 --> 01:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
um the entire requirement for the three
 
01:38:34.729 --> 01:38:34.739 align:start position:0%
and a half time special education person
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
the college and university system uh
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
some of you may remember that in hb2 the
 
01:38:47.209 --> 01:38:47.219 align:start position:0%
governor had proposed a
 
01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
a reorganization I guess I'll call it of
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:38:58.729 --> 01:38:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.330 --> 01:39:04.340 align:start position:0%
okay and in 2023 he had combined
 
01:39:08.149 --> 01:39:08.159 align:start position:0%
the um the dollars for the University
 
01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
system and the um community college
 
01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:13.010 align:start position:0%
system and the um community college
system

01:39:13.010 --> 01:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:17.219 align:start position:0%
well we we separated those out
 
01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
so that for both 22 and 23
 
01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
each the universe system and the
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
community college system will have their
 
01:39:25.679 --> 01:39:27.590 align:start position:0%
community college system will have their
own

01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:39:30.229 --> 01:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
line item in the budget or I guess I
 
01:39:33.890 --> 01:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
should call it AU and in addition to
 
01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:35.689 align:start position:0%
should call it AU and in addition to
that

01:39:35.689 --> 01:39:35.699 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:35.699 --> 01:39:36.950 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:39.169 --> 01:39:39.179 align:start position:0%
we added
 
01:39:43.689 --> 01:39:43.699 align:start position:0%
um money to both the university system
 
01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
and the community college system to
 
01:39:49.790 --> 01:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
bring them to the
 
01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:50.590 align:start position:0%
bring them to the
um

01:39:50.590 --> 01:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:53.450 --> 01:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
2021 funding level
 
01:39:57.890 --> 01:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
so that was uh that was a big jump but
 
01:39:57.900 --> 01:39:59.209 align:start position:0%
so that was uh that was a big jump but
and

01:39:59.209 --> 01:39:59.219 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:03.649 --> 01:40:03.659 align:start position:0%
um police standards and training
 
01:40:03.659 --> 01:40:06.890 align:start position:0%
um police standards and training
uh

01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
the governor had uh
 
01:40:12.970 --> 01:40:12.980 align:start position:0%
because of the liac committee
 
01:40:15.649 --> 01:40:15.659 align:start position:0%
had appropriated
 
01:40:15.659 --> 01:40:17.689 align:start position:0%
had appropriated
twice

01:40:17.689 --> 01:40:17.699 align:start position:0%
twice
 
01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
funding Crisis Intervention team
 
01:40:23.810 --> 01:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
training which
 
01:40:26.810 --> 01:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
01:40:29.810 --> 01:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
police standards and training will put
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
together once we once we pass the budget
 
01:40:38.510 --> 01:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
and provide that training to all of the
 
01:40:41.930 --> 01:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
um all of the police departments
 
01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:42.950 align:start position:0%
um all of the police departments
um

01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
so on line 19 is where the community
 
01:40:48.649 --> 01:40:48.659 align:start position:0%
college system received the additional
 
01:40:55.490 --> 01:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
money and on page six line 23 is where
 
01:40:58.729 --> 01:40:58.739 align:start position:0%
the university system
 
01:40:58.739 --> 01:41:00.410 align:start position:0%
the university system
um

01:41:00.410 --> 01:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:02.290 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:41:02.290 --> 01:41:02.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
received the uh the extra dollars
 
01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:07.550 align:start position:0%
received the uh the extra dollars
so

01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:12.350 --> 01:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
I think that uh hp1 work was relatively
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
easy I noticed Mary this is
 
01:41:17.629 --> 01:41:17.639 align:start position:0%
representative Heath nodding her head HP
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
one was easy so
 
01:41:23.149 --> 01:41:23.159 align:start position:0%
um and uh where are we
 
01:41:25.970 --> 01:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
where we ran into our problems I guess
 
01:41:29.570 --> 01:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
was all in hb2 but uh that's chapter two
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
for some other time so thank you very
 
01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:35.570 align:start position:0%
for some other time so thank you very
much

01:41:35.570 --> 01:41:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
um humberger
 
01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:41:49.310 --> 01:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
representative umberger
 
01:41:51.169 --> 01:41:51.179 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
how stems work so well and we came to a
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
consensus on so many things I'm I'm
 
01:41:59.209 --> 01:41:59.219 align:start position:0%
thrilled that we're able to level fund
 
01:42:01.850 --> 01:42:01.860 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:46:05.689 --> 01:46:05.699 align:start position:0%
on p on section 45 the uh the governor
 
01:46:09.649 --> 01:46:09.659 align:start position:0%
had recommended that we use the 19
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
figure to uh for free and reduced lunch
 
01:46:16.729 --> 01:46:16.739 align:start position:0%
to compute the
 
01:46:16.739 --> 01:46:17.689 align:start position:0%
to compute the
um

01:46:17.689 --> 01:46:17.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
the aid for schools
 
01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:22.370 align:start position:0%
the aid for schools
and

01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
um we accepted that
 
01:46:28.129 --> 01:46:28.139 align:start position:0%
uh we also moved uh the tobacco
 
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
settlement funds uh into uh into hb2 for
 
01:46:36.649 --> 01:46:36.659 align:start position:0%
some reason or other they weren't there
 
01:46:41.290 --> 01:46:41.300 align:start position:0%
the public school infrastructure fund
 
01:46:46.129 --> 01:46:46.139 align:start position:0%
had 30 million dollars in each of the
 
01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
two years
 
01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:50.209 align:start position:0%
two years
and

01:46:50.209 --> 01:46:50.219 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:50.219 --> 01:46:51.470 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:53.810 align:start position:0%
um
primarily

01:46:53.810 --> 01:46:53.820 align:start position:0%
primarily
 
01:46:56.590 --> 01:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
because the
 
01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:58.550 align:start position:0%
because the
latest

01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
latest
 
01:46:58.560 --> 01:46:59.629 align:start position:0%
latest
um

01:46:59.629 --> 01:46:59.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:03.010 --> 01:47:03.020 align:start position:0%
what's it called American Recovery Act
 
01:47:08.090 --> 01:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
uh the uh we were basically informed
 
01:47:12.189 --> 01:47:12.199 align:start position:0%
that many of the projects that were
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh that would qualify for
 
01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:17.810 align:start position:0%
uh that would qualify for
um

01:47:17.810 --> 01:47:17.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:22.490 --> 01:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
the public infrastructure program could
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
in fact be funded by the American
 
01:47:27.890 --> 01:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
Recovery Act
 
01:47:31.129 --> 01:47:31.139 align:start position:0%
and as we looked at
 
01:47:31.139 --> 01:47:31.970 align:start position:0%
and as we looked at
um

01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:34.430 --> 01:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
what is currently
 
01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
on hold because there wasn't enough
 
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:38.629 align:start position:0%
on hold because there wasn't enough
money

01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
that we believe that the public
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund could move to move
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
down to a million dollars a year
 
01:47:55.450 --> 01:47:55.460 align:start position:0%
which left us with um
 
01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
29 million in each of the two years
 
01:48:02.930 --> 01:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
to use for
 
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
um other areas other things
 
01:48:10.609 --> 01:48:10.619 align:start position:0%
within the um
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
within the uh education area that we did
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
not feel were
 
01:48:22.209 --> 01:48:22.219 align:start position:0%
funded at the um
 
01:48:24.050 --> 01:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
appropriate level
 
01:48:26.930 --> 01:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
but by leaving the million dollars in
 
01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:27.709 align:start position:0%
but by leaving the million dollars in
there

01:48:27.709 --> 01:48:27.719 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:48:31.010 --> 01:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
we were in fact able to keep this
 
01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:32.510 align:start position:0%
we were in fact able to keep this
program

01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh viable
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
and I think that that is um
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
that is something that is uh extremely
 
01:48:42.239 --> 01:48:44.770 align:start position:0%
that is something that is uh extremely
important

01:48:44.770 --> 01:48:44.780 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:48:48.169 --> 01:48:48.179 align:start position:0%
uh otherwise the
 
01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
um the program some of you may remember
 
01:48:56.090 --> 01:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
uh that we had this this public
 
01:48:59.629 --> 01:48:59.639 align:start position:0%
infrastructure program was set up
 
01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
um I believe three or three years ago
 
01:49:06.649 --> 01:49:06.659 align:start position:0%
anyhow to take care of problems that the
 
01:49:09.590 --> 01:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
schools were having with safety and
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
internet connection so
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
um that uh that remains
 
01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:16.490 align:start position:0%
um that uh that remains
um

01:49:16.490 --> 01:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:21.290 --> 01:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
as it was so there's there is money to
 
01:49:27.410 --> 01:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:27.420 --> 01:49:28.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:31.129 --> 01:49:31.139 align:start position:0%
as I said the crisis intervention team
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation we uh we deleted that
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
the college and university system Board
 
01:49:44.689 --> 01:49:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
the sister yeah then yeah and the uh
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
Community College
 
01:49:49.679 --> 01:49:51.109 align:start position:0%
Community College
system

01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:49:53.109 --> 01:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
the governor had
 
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
basically recommended that we
 
01:50:02.169 --> 01:50:02.179 align:start position:0%
abolish the two separate boards and form
 
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
a new Board of Trustees
 
01:50:08.689 --> 01:50:08.699 align:start position:0%
consisting of 15 people
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh five people from the University board
 
01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
five people from the community college
 
01:50:21.890 --> 01:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:23.629 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:50:23.629 --> 01:50:23.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:27.970 --> 01:50:27.980 align:start position:0%
um I don't know 10 12 14 20 hours later
 
01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
I have no idea how much time we spent on
 
01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
this along with our friends in uh
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
on the education committee also spent a
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
lot of time providing uh input to us and
 
01:50:46.430 --> 01:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
they they in fact held a uh a
 
01:50:49.689 --> 01:50:49.699 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting that made
 
01:50:52.450 --> 01:50:52.460 align:start position:0%
several recommendations
 
01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh to uh to us that were then
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
Incorporated so to speak within the um
 
01:51:05.090 --> 01:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
within the change to hb2 uh
 
01:51:07.729 --> 01:51:07.739 align:start position:0%
representative turkot since you were
 
01:51:10.010 --> 01:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
kind of the um
 
01:51:13.310 --> 01:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
time motivator behind what we finally
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
ended up with in hb2 could you just give
 
01:51:21.290 --> 01:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
us a little description of what is now
 
01:51:27.590 --> 01:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
in hb2 dealing with uh the merger of the
 
01:51:30.290 --> 01:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
two University Systems
 
01:51:33.290 --> 01:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
certainly uh representative
 
01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:33.970 align:start position:0%
certainly uh representative
um

01:51:33.970 --> 01:51:33.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:36.590 --> 01:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
maybe the best place to start is the
 
01:51:39.470 --> 01:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
reason why we ended up here and that was
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh the current language in hb2 a lot of
 
01:51:46.010 --> 01:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
us felt uh was moving the process a
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
little bit too fast I personally had
 
01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
concerns with the
 
01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
the idea of creating a
 
01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
15-member a Board of Trustees
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh that would be put to uh immediately
 
01:52:02.649 --> 01:52:02.659 align:start position:0%
go to work on
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
implementing this merger
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
I I thought it was something that needed
 
01:52:08.930 --> 01:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
to be slowed down something that the
 
01:52:10.689 --> 01:52:10.699 align:start position:0%
public needed a little bit more input on
 
01:52:14.930 --> 01:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
and that that thought was shared by many
 
01:52:17.229 --> 01:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
members on the committee so what I did
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
instead is we got together and
 
01:52:23.330 --> 01:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
kind of we formed a commission rather
 
01:52:26.450 --> 01:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
than changing over to a Board of
 
01:52:29.229 --> 01:52:29.239 align:start position:0%
Trustees right from the Out start
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
I'll go over basically what kind of
 
01:52:34.370 --> 01:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
changed in it we went from a 15-member
 
01:52:37.729 --> 01:52:37.739 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees down to an 11 member
 
01:52:41.229 --> 01:52:41.239 align:start position:0%
Board of commission Commissioners
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
four from the University of New
 
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire four from the community
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
college system and ultimately three by
 
01:52:50.810 --> 01:52:50.820 align:start position:0%
the governor we had had some
 
01:52:53.149 --> 01:52:53.159 align:start position:0%
intermittent intermediate talks where
 
01:52:56.450 --> 01:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
possibly some legislators were being be
 
01:52:58.250 --> 01:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
involved but we decided in the end to go
 
01:53:01.010 --> 01:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
with the three members appointed by the
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
governor for a total of 11.
 
01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:04.729 align:start position:0%
governor for a total of 11.
um

01:53:04.729 --> 01:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
and the idea of the commission was to
 
01:53:09.590 --> 01:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
get together and actually look at the
 
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
possibility not the not predetermined
 
01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
that it had to be done but the
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
possibility of merging the two College
 
01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:18.169 align:start position:0%
possibility of merging the two College
systems

01:53:18.169 --> 01:53:18.179 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:53:18.179 --> 01:53:19.070 align:start position:0%
systems
um

01:53:19.070 --> 01:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:23.410 --> 01:53:23.420 align:start position:0%
if you look on page nine of our packet
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
really the
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
some of the important stuff is on begins
 
01:53:31.490 --> 01:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
on line number 12 and that basically
 
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
gives the commission uh until January 1
 
01:53:37.970 --> 01:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
of next year
 
01:53:40.970 --> 01:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
the time to look at uh look over
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
everything determine if legislation uh
 
01:53:47.629 --> 01:53:47.639 align:start position:0%
is actually needed to merge the two
 
01:53:47.639 --> 01:53:49.729 align:start position:0%
is actually needed to merge the two
systems

01:53:49.729 --> 01:53:49.739 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
and if that were the case they would of
 
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
course produce legislation it would come
 
01:53:57.770 --> 01:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
before uh committees and then uh uh
 
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
possibly be implemented on July 1st of
 
01:54:03.649 --> 01:54:03.659 align:start position:0%
2023. you'll notice there's a laundry
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
list of items beginning in line 17 on
 
01:54:09.169 --> 01:54:09.179 align:start position:0%
page nine
 
01:54:09.179 --> 01:54:09.890 align:start position:0%
page nine
um

01:54:09.890 --> 01:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:12.649 --> 01:54:12.659 align:start position:0%
issues that we believe they should look
 
01:54:16.669 --> 01:54:16.679 align:start position:0%
at and incorporate into any legislation
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
and a last-minute Edition was if you
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
look online
 
01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
37 and that that was the final report of
 
01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
the study group
 
01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:26.709 align:start position:0%
the study group
for

01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:26.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education that we
 
01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
received just a couple days prior to
 
01:54:36.770 --> 01:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
this amendment being drafted and uh it
 
01:54:39.169 --> 01:54:39.179 align:start position:0%
was included in there if you if you look
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
at it the first six pages of the report
 
01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:43.980 align:start position:0%
are excellent and they're mainly all
 
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
questions questions that are unanswered
 
01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
about what this is going to look like
 
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
how it's going to work all issues that
 
01:54:53.149 --> 01:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
we believe should be included
 
01:54:55.370 --> 01:54:55.380 align:start position:0%
um you know prior to establishing a
 
01:54:57.890 --> 01:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees something that
 
01:54:57.900 --> 01:55:01.430 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees something that
uh

01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:04.189 --> 01:55:04.199 align:start position:0%
anyway that that particular issue really
 
01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
needs to be I think uh above all in the
 
01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
laundry list that really needs to be
 
01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
um regarded it was an excellent report
 
01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:14.450 align:start position:0%
um regarded it was an excellent report
um

01:55:14.450 --> 01:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:17.570 --> 01:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
last thing uh we discussed was different
 
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
dates about uh when it would take effect
 
01:55:22.490 --> 01:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
and we ultimately in the final line
 
01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:23.570 align:start position:0%
and we ultimately in the final line
there

01:55:23.570 --> 01:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
we decided that the best would be that
 
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
it re uh take effect upon the passage
 
01:55:33.410 --> 01:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
also appropriation in line 13 that was a
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
number suggested by the chair of our
 
01:55:39.590 --> 01:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
committee I I really had no comment one
 
01:55:41.930 --> 01:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
way or another on it so that was uh put
 
01:55:46.850 --> 01:55:46.860 align:start position:0%
in on the chairs requests
 
01:55:49.370 --> 01:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
um other than that in the end I think we
 
01:55:51.470 --> 01:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
did very well with it we came out uh
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
unanimous out of our committee was seven
 
01:55:56.450 --> 01:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
to zero uh everybody didn't get
 
01:55:58.669 --> 01:55:58.679 align:start position:0%
everything they wanted
 
01:56:01.070 --> 01:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
but I think everybody got some of what
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
they wanted there were a lot of
 
01:56:04.930 --> 01:56:04.940 align:start position:0%
competing interests as I've noted before
 
01:56:07.070 --> 01:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
but I think in the end we produce
 
01:56:10.910 --> 01:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
something that's reasonable thank you
 
01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Rosa representative
 
01:56:17.330 --> 01:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
turcotte I know that uh every
 
01:56:20.330 --> 01:56:20.340 align:start position:0%
one on that on the committee worked hard
 
01:56:23.209 --> 01:56:23.219 align:start position:0%
to make sure that uh that we got
 
01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
something in here
 
01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:26.870 align:start position:0%
something in here
okay

01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:28.430 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:56:28.430 --> 01:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:32.209 --> 01:56:32.219 align:start position:0%
the commission uh going down to um
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
sections 145 through 148.
 
01:56:40.129 --> 01:56:40.139 align:start position:0%
uh this is a commission to uh study
 
01:56:43.970 --> 01:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
establishment of a Statewide entity to
 
01:56:46.669 --> 01:56:46.679 align:start position:0%
receive complaints of misconduct
 
01:56:46.679 --> 01:56:48.490 align:start position:0%
receive complaints of misconduct
Appropriations

01:56:48.490 --> 01:56:48.500 align:start position:0%
Appropriations
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:56:54.250 --> 01:56:54.260 align:start position:0%
safety and the Attorney General
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
are to get together
 
01:57:01.609 --> 01:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
to figure out what this uh
 
01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
commission was going to look like and uh
 
01:57:09.290 --> 01:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
they had asked for five five positions
 
01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:11.820 align:start position:0%
and this was even before they figured
 
01:57:15.169 --> 01:57:15.179 align:start position:0%
out what the um
 
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
what the commission might look like what
 
01:57:19.250 --> 01:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
it might do or any number of other
 
01:57:21.229 --> 01:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
things so
 
01:57:21.239 --> 01:57:22.330 align:start position:0%
things so
um

01:57:22.330 --> 01:57:22.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:26.209 --> 01:57:26.219 align:start position:0%
we reduce the we reduce the
 
01:57:28.669 --> 01:57:28.679 align:start position:0%
this by um
 
01:57:30.109 --> 01:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
I think it was
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
well we reduced it to one
 
01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
one hundred thousand dollars which
 
01:57:44.089 --> 01:57:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:47.050 --> 01:57:47.060 align:start position:0%
the state scholarship program
 
01:57:53.089 --> 01:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
uh the governor had wanted money in
 
01:57:55.010 --> 01:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
there to
 
01:57:58.089 --> 01:57:58.099 align:start position:0%
um pay off student loans
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
and as a committee we didn't think this
 
01:58:06.410 --> 01:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
was the best use of the money that we
 
01:58:09.970 --> 01:58:09.980 align:start position:0%
would rather provide it on the front end
 
01:58:14.030 --> 01:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
to our New Hampshire students rather
 
01:58:18.109 --> 01:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
than on the back end to Workforce
 
01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
develop Workforce paying off student
 
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
loans and there was uh so anyhow that's
 
01:58:27.890 --> 01:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
what that's what we did and we also
 
01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:29.390 align:start position:0%
what that's what we did and we also
added

01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
added
 
01:58:32.810 --> 01:58:32.820 align:start position:0%
in here that um the governor's
 
01:58:34.270 --> 01:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
scholarship program
 
01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
managed in the same way
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
as the unique program
 
01:58:45.169 --> 01:58:45.179 align:start position:0%
in the higher education
 
01:58:45.179 --> 01:58:47.030 align:start position:0%
in the higher education
Commission

01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:58:49.850 --> 01:58:49.860 align:start position:0%
so there's uh there's money money
 
01:58:52.370 --> 01:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
available there
 
01:58:55.729 --> 01:58:55.739 align:start position:0%
okay the next was uh dual and concurrent
 
01:58:55.739 --> 01:58:57.770 align:start position:0%
okay the next was uh dual and concurrent
enrollment

01:58:57.770 --> 01:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:59:01.850 --> 01:59:01.860 align:start position:0%
once again an extremely popular uh
 
01:59:05.629 --> 01:59:05.639 align:start position:0%
program among High School juniors and
 
01:59:05.639 --> 01:59:06.770 align:start position:0%
program among High School juniors and
seniors

01:59:06.770 --> 01:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
seniors
 
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
and the governor had
 
01:59:12.410 --> 01:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
funded it at zero
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
and we uh did two things
 
01:59:19.729 --> 01:59:19.739 align:start position:0%
the first thing is the uh
 
01:59:23.209 --> 01:59:23.219 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of education did not feel
 
01:59:26.270 --> 01:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
that he should act as a pass-through for
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
this money
 
01:59:30.169 --> 01:59:30.179 align:start position:0%
and so we checked with the Community
 
01:59:33.290 --> 01:59:33.300 align:start position:0%
College to see if they would be willing
 
01:59:35.229 --> 01:59:35.239 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:59:37.970 --> 01:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
administer if that's the right term this
 
01:59:42.290 --> 01:59:42.300 align:start position:0%
program and they agreed to that and we
 
01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
put in uh 1.5
 
01:59:49.070 --> 01:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars in each uh each year of
 
01:59:52.490 --> 01:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
the biennium to
 
01:59:54.950 --> 01:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
Community College thinks it will fully
 
01:59:57.410 --> 01:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
fund if that's the right term whatever
 
02:00:00.770 --> 02:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
whatever that means but we we anticipate
 
02:00:02.990 --> 02:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
being able to um
 
02:00:06.050 --> 02:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
completely fund uh the Dual and
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment program
 
02:00:09.679 --> 02:00:11.450 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment program
uh

02:00:11.450 --> 02:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:00:16.129 --> 02:00:16.139 align:start position:0%
next we added a section from
 
02:00:16.139 --> 02:00:18.649 align:start position:0%
next we added a section from
the

02:00:18.649 --> 02:00:18.659 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:22.490 --> 02:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
5 594 is that the right number
 
02:00:25.370 --> 02:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
that talked about
 
02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:26.930 align:start position:0%
that talked about
um

02:00:26.930 --> 02:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:30.770 --> 02:00:30.780 align:start position:0%
a 10-year plan for Grant projects for
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
school building and so what this does is
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
that it encourages the local school
 
02:00:42.669 --> 02:00:42.679 align:start position:0%
boards to look out for 10 years as to
 
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
what kinds of things are they going to
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
require that they want state aid for and
 
02:00:54.410 --> 02:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
the other half of that is that it allows
 
02:00:58.129 --> 02:00:58.139 align:start position:0%
the allows doe to know
 
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
where things are going with uh with
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
school building eight so we thought that
 
02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
that was uh that was excellent
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh last year
 
02:01:13.930 --> 02:01:13.940 align:start position:0%
oh two years ago excuse me
 
02:01:17.530 --> 02:01:17.540 align:start position:0%
uh what
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
kindergarten adequate education grants
 
02:01:23.450 --> 02:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
got left out for several
 
02:01:26.270 --> 02:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
communities that were starting up
 
02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:27.770 align:start position:0%
communities that were starting up
kindergarten

02:01:27.770 --> 02:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
kindergarten
 
02:01:29.930 --> 02:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:31.870 align:start position:0%
and so
um

02:01:31.870 --> 02:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:36.050 --> 02:01:36.060 align:start position:0%
we the Senate came over and asked us if
 
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
we would include that in our budget and
 
02:01:45.550 --> 02:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:47.450 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:01:47.450 --> 02:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:01:47.460 --> 02:01:49.460 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:49.470 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:01:49.470 --> 02:01:54.470 align:start position:0%
uh
[Music]

02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:56.689 align:start position:0%
 
we

02:01:56.689 --> 02:01:56.699 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:01:59.870 --> 02:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
these last these last three
 
02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:02.750 align:start position:0%
these last these last three
amendments

02:02:02.750 --> 02:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
or the last I guess I should say the
 
02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:05.510 align:start position:0%
or the last I guess I should say the
last

02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
last
 
02:02:09.050 --> 02:02:09.060 align:start position:0%
oh I forgot uh representative Weiler
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
wanted it and wanted an amendment
 
02:02:15.530 --> 02:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
dealing with how people how vacancies
 
02:02:19.370 --> 02:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
are filled on Cooperative School
 
02:02:23.089 --> 02:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
District boards and that amendment made
 
02:02:26.930 --> 02:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
made sense to uh to all of us
 
02:02:26.940 --> 02:02:32.109 align:start position:0%
made sense to uh to all of us
okay

02:02:32.109 --> 02:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:36.589 --> 02:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
120 or yeah one zero two seven
 
02:02:36.599 --> 02:02:38.830 align:start position:0%
120 or yeah one zero two seven
and

02:02:38.830 --> 02:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:42.890 --> 02:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
one zero two three
 
02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
two two I'm sorry three two I must be
 
02:02:46.020 --> 02:02:48.470 align:start position:0%
two two I'm sorry three two I must be
dyslexic

02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
dyslexic
 
02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:49.850 align:start position:0%
dyslexic
um

02:02:49.850 --> 02:02:49.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:52.970 --> 02:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:02:56.950 --> 02:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means As We Know
 
02:03:03.970 --> 02:03:03.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:09.229 --> 02:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
get uh to project that there would be
 
02:03:09.239 --> 02:03:09.830 align:start position:0%
get uh to project that there would be
um

02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
additional dollars available
 
02:03:17.810 --> 02:03:17.820 align:start position:0%
and what came to the uh education trust
 
02:03:17.820 --> 02:03:18.910 align:start position:0%
and what came to the uh education trust
fund

02:03:18.910 --> 02:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
was 44 million dollars
 
02:03:26.990 --> 02:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:31.550 --> 02:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
money that we then had to had to spend
 
02:03:33.950 --> 02:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
oh well we didn't have to spend it but
 
02:03:35.810 --> 02:03:35.820 align:start position:0%
we didn't think it needed to sit around
 
02:03:39.850 --> 02:03:39.860 align:start position:0%
when we had necessary needs
 
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:46.669 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:46.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:50.570 --> 02:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
the speaker this is all part of that
 
02:03:53.209 --> 02:03:53.219 align:start position:0%
money that we were that Ways and Means
 
02:03:55.490 --> 02:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
was able to provide
 
02:03:58.089 --> 02:03:58.099 align:start position:0%
uh the speaker
 
02:04:02.330 --> 02:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
then provided us with another 100
 
02:04:04.250 --> 02:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:04:07.790 --> 02:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
which came to 144 million
 
02:04:12.410 --> 02:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of this hundred million
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
is to reduce the swep payments that
 
02:04:21.070 --> 02:04:21.080 align:start position:0%
individual towns will be making
 
02:04:24.290 --> 02:04:24.300 align:start position:0%
and the state will then
 
02:04:27.050 --> 02:04:27.060 align:start position:0%
you know provide the money that they
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
would have collected
 
02:04:33.709 --> 02:04:33.719 align:start position:0%
so I had we so the the speaker was going
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
to have a well we were going to transfer
 
02:04:40.910 --> 02:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
100 million we had 44 million so we said
 
02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:42.530 align:start position:0%
100 million we had 44 million so we said
look

02:04:42.530 --> 02:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
look
 
02:04:46.010 --> 02:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
we'll keep the 44 million and Mr Speaker
 
02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
only give only you know transfer the 63.
 
02:04:53.810 --> 02:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
so I mean it's it's all the same it all
 
02:04:56.030 --> 02:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
works out the same but we were going to
 
02:04:58.669 --> 02:04:58.679 align:start position:0%
transfer 44 million over to the general
 
02:04:58.679 --> 02:04:59.870 align:start position:0%
transfer 44 million over to the general
fund

02:04:59.870 --> 02:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:05:03.709 --> 02:05:03.719 align:start position:0%
okay and then transfer back in 100
 
02:05:06.109 --> 02:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
million which
 
02:05:08.930 --> 02:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
really didn't make sense and so uh
 
02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:10.490 align:start position:0%
really didn't make sense and so uh
Mickey

02:05:10.490 --> 02:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
Mickey
 
02:05:13.870 --> 02:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
in his wonderful way
 
02:05:18.350 --> 02:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
uh suggested that uh that this is uh
 
02:05:20.270 --> 02:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
This Is How We Do It
 
02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:22.250 align:start position:0%
This Is How We Do It
so

02:05:22.250 --> 02:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
the 44 million that we're talking about
 
02:05:30.649 --> 02:05:30.659 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:05:32.570 --> 02:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
ends up
 
02:05:36.169 --> 02:05:36.179 align:start position:0%
and now go you know the switch if you
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:49.010 --> 02:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:53.570 --> 02:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:57.770 --> 02:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
I think the amenities uh Amendment 1032h
 
02:06:00.050 --> 02:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
which is page number 30 in the House
 
02:06:03.649 --> 02:06:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:05.930 --> 02:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
thank you I just didn't turn the page
 
02:06:08.510 --> 02:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:12.830 --> 02:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
so what this money that we're talking
 
02:06:14.890 --> 02:06:14.900 align:start position:0%
about will
 
02:06:18.189 --> 02:06:18.199 align:start position:0%
uh be used for
 
02:06:18.199 --> 02:06:19.970 align:start position:0%
uh be used for
is

02:06:19.970 --> 02:06:19.980 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:21.229 align:start position:0%
is
um

02:06:21.229 --> 02:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
four million
 
02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:24.910 align:start position:0%
four million
for

02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:06:27.770 --> 02:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
apportionment a
 
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
and this is the distribution to the
 
02:06:34.189 --> 02:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
towns and cities
 
02:06:38.209 --> 02:06:38.219 align:start position:0%
the gas tax collections are down
 
02:06:38.219 --> 02:06:40.270 align:start position:0%
the gas tax collections are down
significantly

02:06:40.270 --> 02:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:41.810 align:start position:0%
significantly
and

02:06:41.810 --> 02:06:41.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:44.689 --> 02:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
um apportionment a or Highway block
 
02:06:44.699 --> 02:06:45.790 align:start position:0%
um apportionment a or Highway block
grants

02:06:45.790 --> 02:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
grants
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
are provided to the towns based on
 
02:06:55.370 --> 02:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
three cents of every dollar collected in
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
the road toll
 
02:06:57.599 --> 02:06:59.030 align:start position:0%
the road toll
so

02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:07:03.649 --> 02:07:03.659 align:start position:0%
when the road toll is down the money
 
02:07:05.930 --> 02:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
that goes to the towns and cities is
 
02:07:07.250 --> 02:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
also down
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
so this four million dollars uh allows
 
02:07:16.850 --> 02:07:16.860 align:start position:0%
us to get us back pretty much to where
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
we were in uh 20.
 
02:07:21.470 --> 02:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
02:07:24.350 --> 02:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
the the towns and cities will not be
 
02:07:27.649 --> 02:07:27.659 align:start position:0%
seeing a decrease in that
 
02:07:30.770 --> 02:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
uh we put 5 million into the betterment
 
02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:32.089 align:start position:0%
uh we put 5 million into the betterment
program

02:07:32.089 --> 02:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
dot had expressed that because the gas
 
02:07:40.669 --> 02:07:40.679 align:start position:0%
tax was down and this is 12 cents of
 
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
every dollar of gas tax
 
02:07:43.679 --> 02:07:45.229 align:start position:0%
every dollar of gas tax
that

02:07:45.229 --> 02:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to continue their
 
02:07:50.290 --> 02:07:50.300 align:start position:0%
betterment program
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
at the same level as they had in the
 
02:07:54.239 --> 02:07:55.070 align:start position:0%
at the same level as they had in the
past

02:07:55.070 --> 02:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
past
 
02:07:57.050 --> 02:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
Paving roads fixing Bridges doing all of
 
02:08:08.209 --> 02:08:08.219 align:start position:0%
those things are
 
02:08:12.290 --> 02:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
extremely important uh for the state and
 
02:08:14.930 --> 02:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
so we put another
 
02:08:17.390 --> 02:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
five million into that
 
02:08:23.050 --> 02:08:23.060 align:start position:0%
we also put 6 million into acquisition
 
02:08:26.030 --> 02:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
of uh equip
 
02:08:28.850 --> 02:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
vehicles and Equipment
 
02:08:31.609 --> 02:08:31.619 align:start position:0%
um safety or safety
 
02:08:33.910 --> 02:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation had had had
 
02:08:36.830 --> 02:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
to cut
 
02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:37.750 align:start position:0%
to cut
um

02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:42.109 --> 02:08:42.119 align:start position:0%
the uh money for uh
 
02:08:42.119 --> 02:08:43.510 align:start position:0%
the uh money for uh
equipment

02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
02:08:47.930 --> 02:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
significantly and it would have would
 
02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:51.599 align:start position:0%
have caused some some real problems in
 
02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
keeping up with their vehicle purchase
 
02:09:00.530 --> 02:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
program and so we put uh six million
 
02:09:00.540 --> 02:09:01.550 align:start position:0%
program and so we put uh six million
dollars

02:09:01.550 --> 02:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
into into that
 
02:09:07.129 --> 02:09:07.139 align:start position:0%
and then if you'll notice in HP one I
 
02:09:08.689 --> 02:09:08.699 align:start position:0%
said I took money away from Winter
 
02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance and that just wait I would
 
02:09:16.189 --> 02:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
put it back which I have done here in uh
 
02:09:19.070 --> 02:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
in hb2
 
02:09:20.750 --> 02:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
02:09:24.770 --> 02:09:24.780 align:start position:0%
there was still dollars out of this 44
 
02:09:27.410 --> 02:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
million that arrived in the education
 
02:09:30.010 --> 02:09:30.020 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
02:09:34.070 --> 02:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
and so what we did
 
02:09:37.790 --> 02:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
is that we put
 
02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:43.430 align:start position:0%
is that we put
uh

02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:48.850 --> 02:09:48.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:52.430 --> 02:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh into
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:59.870 --> 02:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
is that right yeah we put that into the
 
02:10:02.450 --> 02:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
bill building aid program
 
02:10:04.129 --> 02:10:04.139 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
02:10:04.139 --> 02:10:05.030 align:start position:0%
uh for
um

02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:16.850 --> 02:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that's yeah 19 million is what
 
02:10:19.129 --> 02:10:19.139 align:start position:0%
we put in for
 
02:10:21.890 --> 02:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
um new projects
 
02:10:24.370 --> 02:10:24.380 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:10:29.330 --> 02:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:32.930 --> 02:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
is it 20 29 million I think was the
 
02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:33.770 align:start position:0%
is it 20 29 million I think was the
figure

02:10:33.770 --> 02:10:33.780 align:start position:0%
figure
 
02:10:33.780 --> 02:10:35.330 align:start position:0%
figure
that

02:10:35.330 --> 02:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
um Department of Education
 
02:10:40.729 --> 02:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
owes to
 
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
school systems that have bonds that go
 
02:10:47.450 --> 02:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
out until
 
02:10:47.460 --> 02:10:51.109 align:start position:0%
out until
2042.

02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:55.070 --> 02:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
so we talked to doe to see if there was
 
02:10:58.430 --> 02:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
any way we could accelerate those
 
02:11:01.609 --> 02:11:01.619 align:start position:0%
programs those Bond payments
 
02:11:05.870 --> 02:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
to get us not to have to continue paying
 
02:11:09.709 --> 02:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
this and reducing the amount of building
 
02:11:12.589 --> 02:11:12.599 align:start position:0%
Aid that we might have available in the
 
02:11:12.599 --> 02:11:13.490 align:start position:0%
Aid that we might have available in the
future

02:11:13.490 --> 02:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:11:16.850 --> 02:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
and they said yes that could be done
 
02:11:19.550 --> 02:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
and so we placed
 
02:11:22.370 --> 02:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
um eight million dollars
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
against reducing those
 
02:11:28.550 --> 02:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh we've got too many tales out there so
 
02:11:31.070 --> 02:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
I don't like to call it the tail but
 
02:11:33.189 --> 02:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
this is to pay off
 
02:11:38.030 --> 02:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
uh school systems for outstanding bonds
 
02:11:40.070 --> 02:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
that they have
 
02:11:43.729 --> 02:11:43.739 align:start position:0%
and uh then that will allow in the next
 
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
biennium you know another
 
02:11:48.530 --> 02:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
8 million plus whatever they're paying
 
02:11:52.370 --> 02:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
off this year to hopefully go into into
 
02:11:56.089 --> 02:11:56.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:56.099 --> 02:11:56.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:11:56.990 --> 02:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:11:59.149 --> 02:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
so how hopefully
 
02:11:59.159 --> 02:12:00.729 align:start position:0%
so how hopefully
that

02:12:00.729 --> 02:12:00.739 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
covers everything like I said we were
 
02:12:07.209 --> 02:12:07.219 align:start position:0%
we were
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
razor laser focused on hb2 because this
 
02:12:16.490 --> 02:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
is where you know where we had uh
 
02:12:20.689 --> 02:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
we had our we had our problems and uh I
 
02:12:22.850 --> 02:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
would say that all of the Departments
 
02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
came in to us
 
02:12:29.629 --> 02:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
with extremely lean budgets
 
02:12:31.850 --> 02:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:12:35.870 --> 02:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
and I know that uh that I appreciated it
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
and that's when uh representative Weiler
 
02:12:41.629 --> 02:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
asked me if I could cut any general
 
02:12:46.030 --> 02:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
funds and I think we ended up with
 
02:12:50.649 --> 02:12:50.659 align:start position:0%
1.5 million reduction in general funds
 
02:12:54.890 --> 02:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
each year of the biennia so I did
 
02:12:58.069 --> 02:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
contribute just a little bit but again
 
02:13:03.169 --> 02:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
division two is is primarily made up of
 
02:13:07.010 --> 02:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh Highway funds education funds Fish
 
02:13:12.109 --> 02:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
and Game fund and so the uh our share of
 
02:13:15.290 --> 02:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
uh General funds is very limited but
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
again I want to thank everybody for all
 
02:13:22.669 --> 02:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
of the hard work on division two and I
 
02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
left out Mick landrigan the first time
 
02:13:25.199 --> 02:13:27.470 align:start position:0%
left out Mick landrigan the first time
and

02:13:27.470 --> 02:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:13:30.770 --> 02:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you what this guy is a genius
 
02:13:34.970 --> 02:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
okay when it comes to all of the issues
 
02:13:38.810 --> 02:13:38.820 align:start position:0%

it's truly a technical amendment that
 
02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
lines up with what the intent of
 
02:16:31.609 --> 02:16:31.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:31.619 --> 02:16:34.490 align:start position:0%
 
changes

02:16:34.490 --> 02:16:34.500 align:start position:0%

so
 
02:16:48.950 --> 02:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
um with the 100 million dollar sweat
 
02:16:50.330 --> 02:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
reduction Amendment
 
02:16:53.509 --> 02:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
uh in fiscal 23. as we all know uh the
 
02:16:55.549 --> 02:16:55.559 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax is part
 
02:16:56.570 --> 02:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:16:58.549 --> 02:16:58.559 align:start position:0%
formula for determining total education
 
02:17:01.310 --> 02:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
grants the intent of division two was to
 
02:17:03.290 --> 02:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
essentially buy down the amount the
 
02:17:05.810 --> 02:17:05.820 align:start position:0%
amount of swept required to be raised in
 
02:17:07.250 --> 02:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
that one year through an infusion of
 
02:17:08.870 --> 02:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
General funds
 
02:17:11.330 --> 02:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
um we didn't consider any unintended
 
02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
consequences to Total education grants
 
02:17:15.950 --> 02:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
to any cities and towns so if you look
 
02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
on this amendment section two you will
 
02:17:20.330 --> 02:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
see here that in the event
 
02:17:22.429 --> 02:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
total education grants are negatively
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
impacted through this wept reduction in
 
02:17:27.709 --> 02:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 the Department of Education
 
02:17:29.450 --> 02:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
would provide a supplemental payment to
 
02:17:31.070 --> 02:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
any affected cities and towns to make
 
02:17:33.889 --> 02:17:33.899 align:start position:0%
sure that this action would have no
 
02:17:42.429 --> 02:17:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:45.709 --> 02:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
as part of your package you're
 
02:17:48.290 --> 02:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
substituting this new Amendment as the
 
02:17:49.849 --> 02:17:49.859 align:start position:0%
last page
 
02:17:54.169 --> 02:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:57.230 --> 02:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
is that supported by hb2 or our
 
02:17:58.849 --> 02:17:58.859 align:start position:0%
correction division two members support
 
02:17:58.859 --> 02:18:01.910 align:start position:0%
correction division two members support
it

02:18:01.910 --> 02:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:04.490 --> 02:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
can I say hb2 can you show my show of
 
02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:08.280 align:start position:0%

okay
 
02:18:12.169 --> 02:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
and I think I'm looking for
 
02:18:15.349 --> 02:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative buco
 
02:18:18.049 --> 02:18:18.059 align:start position:0%

02:18:38.990 --> 02:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh what I hope to do is minimize the
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
roll calls but I think you have to do a
 
02:18:44.209 --> 02:18:44.219 align:start position:0%

budget by division
 
02:26:48.050 --> 02:26:48.060 align:start position:0%

we'll next call upon representative
Edwards

02:26:49.190 --> 02:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
Edwards
 
02:26:51.950 --> 02:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
the chairman of division three for his
 
02:26:54.290 --> 02:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
remarks on hb1
 
02:26:57.530 --> 02:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh if we could do
 
02:27:00.830 --> 02:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
a share screen to show what I refer to
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
as a horse blanket the the long document
 
02:27:07.490 --> 02:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's entitled division three category
 
02:27:10.790 --> 02:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
five house finance versus Governor
 
02:27:12.830 --> 02:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
detail change
 
02:27:16.910 --> 02:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
there it is there it is okay so
 
02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
um this is a combination of some policy
 
02:27:22.190 --> 02:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh changes that we made as we went
 
02:27:25.610 --> 02:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
through hb1 and I think some technical
 
02:27:28.910 --> 02:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
changes that were made by the DHHS
 
02:27:32.450 --> 02:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
Finance in conjunction with our LBA so
 
02:27:35.290 --> 02:27:35.300 align:start position:0%
I'll uh spend more time talking about
 
02:27:39.290 --> 02:27:39.300 align:start position:0%
what we did as a matter of policy I
 
02:27:42.349 --> 02:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
think uh as a matter of context it's
 
02:27:45.410 --> 02:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
worth noting that division three is a
 
02:27:48.290 --> 02:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
very large and complex Department over
 
02:27:50.750 --> 02:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the funds that we have to
 
02:27:53.570 --> 02:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
appropriate are actually from the
 
02:27:56.570 --> 02:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
federal government so General funds
 
02:27:59.210 --> 02:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
represents less than a third of what the
 
02:28:01.090 --> 02:28:01.100 align:start position:0%
department spends
 
02:28:03.950 --> 02:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
some major assumptions that we made for
 
02:28:07.370 --> 02:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
this budget cycle is that when we went
 
02:28:09.590 --> 02:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
into it we assumed that we were working
 
02:28:12.770 --> 02:28:12.780 align:start position:0%
from the ways and means estimate that we
 
02:28:15.349 --> 02:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
voted on in the last house session
 
02:28:18.050 --> 02:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
we assume that even though we knew that
 
02:28:20.450 --> 02:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
there would be another round of cares
 
02:28:23.210 --> 02:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
act money maybe as much as just a just
 
02:28:25.250 --> 02:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
under a billion dollars we didn't count
 
02:28:27.650 --> 02:28:27.660 align:start position:0%
on any of that billion dollars as
 
02:28:30.110 --> 02:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
helping with the the mission that we
 
02:28:32.450 --> 02:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
were looking to fund
 
02:28:35.290 --> 02:28:35.300 align:start position:0%
um we looked at the enhanced
 
02:28:38.570 --> 02:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
Medicaid match and
 
02:28:40.969 --> 02:28:40.979 align:start position:0%
um recognized that that would probably
 
02:28:44.090 --> 02:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
continue for the first six months of the
 
02:28:46.490 --> 02:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
first fiscal year so there were several
 
02:28:50.030 --> 02:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
accounts that rely on Medicaid match
 
02:28:52.309 --> 02:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
right now there's an enhanced match
 
02:28:54.710 --> 02:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's taking place which lets more
 
02:28:56.570 --> 02:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
Federal money go against our budget
 
02:28:58.730 --> 02:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
rather than General funds so that that
 
02:29:01.370 --> 02:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
helped us so we've taken advantage of
 
02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
that accounting we've also
 
02:29:07.610 --> 02:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
02:29:11.150 --> 02:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
we've also take taken a large number of
 
02:29:14.210 --> 02:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
departments that were federal funds only
 
02:29:17.510 --> 02:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
or other agency funds only and basically
 
02:29:20.690 --> 02:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
just accepted them uh without any
 
02:29:22.790 --> 02:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
significant debate
 
02:29:26.389 --> 02:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
so so that gets us into this uh this
 
02:29:29.590 --> 02:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
first line uh this is a fairly major
 
02:29:32.929 --> 02:29:32.939 align:start position:0%
policy decision that was made and uh
 
02:29:36.170 --> 02:29:36.180 align:start position:0%
these first accounting uh numbers uh
 
02:29:40.130 --> 02:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
from one through 15 reflect that the
 
02:29:44.349 --> 02:29:44.359 align:start position:0%
policy decision was to uh essentially
 
02:29:48.309 --> 02:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
have legislature legislature driven
 
02:29:51.830 --> 02:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
closure of the sununu center and I I
 
02:29:54.410 --> 02:29:54.420 align:start position:0%
pointed out as legislative uh lead
 
02:29:57.170 --> 02:29:57.180 align:start position:0%
driven because this was not in the
 
02:30:00.590 --> 02:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
Department's recommendation so so
 
02:30:03.610 --> 02:30:03.620 align:start position:0%
um in a very bipartisan way
 
02:30:06.950 --> 02:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
the the funds that you see removed in FY
 
02:30:11.090 --> 02:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
23 are related to the sununu center
 
02:30:13.070 --> 02:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
um there should be another three million
 
02:30:14.690 --> 02:30:14.700 align:start position:0%
dollars that will come across somewhere
 
02:30:18.830 --> 02:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
in here 2.6 million to um to provide
 
02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
some ongoing funds so that they can
 
02:30:21.840 --> 02:30:23.870 align:start position:0%
some ongoing funds so that they can
transition

02:30:23.870 --> 02:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
transition
 
02:30:27.530 --> 02:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
um next down on line 21 this is an
 
02:30:30.770 --> 02:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
example of adding back money for uh
 
02:30:35.050 --> 02:30:35.060 align:start position:0%
extending the assumptions around
 
02:30:37.870 --> 02:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
fmap the enhanced fmap
 
02:30:40.450 --> 02:30:40.460 align:start position:0%
in the acronyms they're Federal Medical
 
02:30:42.590 --> 02:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
Assistance percentage
 
02:30:46.969 --> 02:30:46.979 align:start position:0%
uh so so that it shows a deckerman and
 
02:30:48.710 --> 02:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
general funds and an increase in federal
 
02:30:52.130 --> 02:30:52.140 align:start position:0%
funds of about 2.3 million
 
02:30:53.750 --> 02:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
um the next one
 
02:30:58.370 --> 02:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
line 23 represents a decision to take
 
02:31:03.710 --> 02:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
out of the operating funds out of hb1 25
 
02:31:06.650 --> 02:31:06.660 align:start position:0%
million for the biennium this is uh
 
02:31:10.870 --> 02:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
money that was meant to pay for the
 
02:31:13.610 --> 02:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
Medicaid management information system
 
02:31:17.570 --> 02:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
to to to have the Legacy system run in
 
02:31:21.170 --> 02:31:21.180 align:start position:0%
parallel while they phase in the new
 
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
system so rather than having uh
 
02:31:27.670 --> 02:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
effectively a one-time expense reflected
 
02:31:32.030 --> 02:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
as operating funny money we moved those
 
02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
funds over to
 
02:31:38.889 --> 02:31:38.899 align:start position:0%
hb2 for uh 25 million for the biennium
 
02:31:42.110 --> 02:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh when we did that
 
02:31:47.030 --> 02:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
um uh we ended up making it appear as
 
02:31:49.550 --> 02:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
though we were decreasing federal funds
 
02:31:52.730 --> 02:31:52.740 align:start position:0%
to the tune of 67 million and the
 
02:31:54.830 --> 02:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
reality is that we will still have
 
02:31:56.990 --> 02:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
access to that money it's just Federal
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
money that will have to be picked up by
 
02:32:02.150 --> 02:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
The Joint legislative committee uh later
 
02:32:03.590 --> 02:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
but those funds are going to be
 
02:32:05.450 --> 02:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
available for the Medicaid management
 
02:32:08.270 --> 02:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
information system transition from
 
02:32:10.730 --> 02:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
Legacy to a new system
 
02:32:14.650 --> 02:32:14.660 align:start position:0%
on the second page line 28
 
02:32:18.230 --> 02:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly significant policy
 
02:32:18.240 --> 02:32:19.790 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly significant policy
decision

02:32:19.790 --> 02:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:32:23.570 --> 02:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
um under the current law the the uh the
 
02:32:25.730 --> 02:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
administration the executive branch was
 
02:32:28.429 --> 02:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
only responsible for funding the first
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
five million dollars to help the
 
02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
counties pay for some nursing home
 
02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:33.530 align:start position:0%
counties pay for some nursing home
expenses

02:32:33.530 --> 02:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
02:32:36.469 --> 02:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
and uh and then historically there's
 
02:32:40.130 --> 02:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
been something called a county cap where
 
02:32:42.530 --> 02:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
um subsequently in the budget process
 
02:32:45.410 --> 02:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
money was added back and it historically
 
02:32:48.050 --> 02:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
the counties have been expecting about a
 
02:32:50.809 --> 02:32:50.819 align:start position:0%
three three percent per year increase in
 
02:32:53.270 --> 02:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
their the amount that they need to pay
 
02:32:56.750 --> 02:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
well what we did this term was we added
 
02:32:56.760 --> 02:32:57.889 align:start position:0%
well what we did this term was we added
back

02:32:57.889 --> 02:32:57.899 align:start position:0%
back
 
02:33:01.070 --> 02:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
um uh so that it effectively will reduce
 
02:33:04.370 --> 02:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
the County's obligation to uh two
 
02:33:07.730 --> 02:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
percent growth and that's significant
 
02:33:12.170 --> 02:33:12.180 align:start position:0%
because as we got testimony from
 
02:33:13.670 --> 02:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
um from Rockingham County and
 
02:33:16.190 --> 02:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County in Rockingham County
 
02:33:19.130 --> 02:33:19.140 align:start position:0%
for example had we not done anything it
 
02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
would have forced the county to raise
 
02:33:24.170 --> 02:33:24.180 align:start position:0%
their property tax Portion by seven
 
02:33:27.110 --> 02:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
percent so so although it doesn't look
 
02:33:31.670 --> 02:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
like a uh property tax decrease to the
 
02:33:35.690 --> 02:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
naked eye this is effectively us funding
 
02:33:39.170 --> 02:33:39.180 align:start position:0%
um uh relief for County property taxes
 
02:33:41.929 --> 02:33:41.939 align:start position:0%
it's something to keep your your eye on
 
02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
as it goes through the Senate
 
02:33:49.010 --> 02:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
line 33 this is 50 000 in general funds
 
02:33:52.490 --> 02:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
that we added back and or added in FY 22
 
02:33:55.429 --> 02:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
to the Family Planning money this fifty
 
02:33:57.290 --> 02:33:57.300 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is to be made available
 
02:33:57.300 --> 02:33:58.849 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is to be made available
to

02:33:58.849 --> 02:33:58.859 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:34:01.610 --> 02:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
um to assist in stimulating competition
 
02:34:05.469 --> 02:34:05.479 align:start position:0%
for new family uh planning uh program
 
02:34:05.479 --> 02:34:08.469 align:start position:0%
for new family uh planning uh program
clinics

02:34:08.469 --> 02:34:08.479 align:start position:0%
clinics
 
02:34:12.650 --> 02:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
so that that uh that 50 000 could be
 
02:34:14.750 --> 02:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
seen either as a bonus to get to
 
02:34:16.969 --> 02:34:16.979 align:start position:0%
stimulate new competition or if there's
 
02:34:19.070 --> 02:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
a new awardee then there's some money
 
02:34:21.469 --> 02:34:21.479 align:start position:0%
there for them to help with the first
 
02:34:24.530 --> 02:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
time startup costs
 
02:34:26.770 --> 02:34:26.780 align:start position:0%
under the
 
02:34:31.990 --> 02:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
line 45 down there this is uh also
 
02:34:35.990 --> 02:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
enhancements from the uh the the higher
 
02:34:40.309 --> 02:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
than usual uh uh medical assistance
 
02:34:46.190 --> 02:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:49.070 --> 02:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
going on the last row of the previous
 
02:34:52.250 --> 02:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
page down to row 48.
 
02:34:55.670 --> 02:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
um this is I think
 
02:34:58.250 --> 02:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
this is also related to the fmap from
 
02:35:01.429 --> 02:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
above and the next lines are as well so
 
02:35:03.250 --> 02:35:03.260 align:start position:0%
all of these different lines are
 
02:35:06.290 --> 02:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
Medicaid related and so they benefit
 
02:35:10.389 --> 02:35:10.399 align:start position:0%
from having a higher Medicaid match
 
02:35:15.290 --> 02:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
down on line 55
 
02:35:15.300 --> 02:35:15.950 align:start position:0%
down on line 55
um

02:35:15.950 --> 02:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:18.889 --> 02:35:18.899 align:start position:0%
this was I don't really know the right
 
02:35:21.830 --> 02:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
way to exp to couch it whether it was an
 
02:35:24.110 --> 02:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
error or an oversight or a mistake or
 
02:35:27.889 --> 02:35:27.899 align:start position:0%
whatever but the reality is there was a
 
02:35:30.469 --> 02:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
9.1 million dollars that we were
 
02:35:34.010 --> 02:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
expecting to come from another line to
 
02:35:37.610 --> 02:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
help with the New Hampshire hospital and
 
02:35:40.849 --> 02:35:40.859 align:start position:0%
um and because that was a mistake we
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
ended up adding 9 in general funds to
 
02:35:46.090 --> 02:35:46.100 align:start position:0%
cover it
 
02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
the next line 59 and 60. these are
 
02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
related there's a a system out there
 
02:35:55.630 --> 02:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
that shares admissions
 
02:35:59.889 --> 02:35:59.899 align:start position:0%
discharges and transfer uh hl7 messages
 
02:36:03.230 --> 02:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
in between a bunch of interconnected I.T
 
02:36:06.290 --> 02:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
systems in the communities and this is a
 
02:36:09.230 --> 02:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
I.T system that helps coordinate care
 
02:36:10.990 --> 02:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
out into the community
 
02:36:15.469 --> 02:36:15.479 align:start position:0%
as patients move about this this is the
 
02:36:16.910 --> 02:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
opposite of what we did with the
 
02:36:19.210 --> 02:36:19.220 align:start position:0%
Medicaid management information system
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
this is actually an ongoing program that
 
02:36:25.790 --> 02:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
should not have been in hp2 so we moved
 
02:36:31.210 --> 02:36:31.220 align:start position:0%
it over to HP one and in doing so that
 
02:36:35.090 --> 02:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
revealed that there was uh 600 000
 
02:36:38.690 --> 02:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
matching from federal money the the
 
02:36:45.230 --> 02:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
extra 6 1608 was a typo that a one of
 
02:36:48.710 --> 02:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
our accountants found and she used this
 
02:36:50.809 --> 02:36:50.819 align:start position:0%
opportunity to fix that but it's really
 
02:36:54.170 --> 02:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
a 200 000 transfer of General funds and
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
a six hundred thousand gain and
 
02:36:56.880 --> 02:36:57.889 align:start position:0%
a six hundred thousand gain and
um

02:36:57.889 --> 02:36:57.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:01.969 --> 02:37:01.979 align:start position:0%
in uh Federal matching
 
02:37:04.220 --> 02:37:04.230 align:start position:0%

02:37:04.230 --> 02:37:05.270 align:start position:0%

we

02:37:11.950 --> 02:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
were able to fund two temporary
 
02:37:18.469 --> 02:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
positions in child protection using a
 
02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
hundred percent federal funds
 
02:37:23.210 --> 02:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
um that wasn't really a Division III
 
02:37:26.570 --> 02:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
decision it was more of a DHHS find
 
02:37:28.969 --> 02:37:28.979 align:start position:0%
after the budget had been submitted and
 
02:37:32.450 --> 02:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
so we accepted it same thing with the
 
02:37:36.530 --> 02:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
sixty thousand dollars there for an a
 
02:37:38.929 --> 02:37:38.939 align:start position:0%
grant award
 
02:37:38.939 --> 02:37:41.150 align:start position:0%
grant award
um

02:37:41.150 --> 02:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:44.530 --> 02:37:44.540 align:start position:0%
there were some other technical
 
02:37:49.150 --> 02:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
adjustments made starting on line 71
 
02:37:52.190 --> 02:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
and running down
 
02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:53.090 align:start position:0%
and running down
um

02:37:53.090 --> 02:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:56.150 --> 02:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
until we get to
 
02:38:03.170 --> 02:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:05.809 --> 02:38:05.819 align:start position:0%
down to line
 
02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
80. those those are technical
 
02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:10.250 align:start position:0%
80. those those are technical
adjustments

02:38:10.250 --> 02:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
02:38:13.429 --> 02:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
um then when we get to line 81 this is
 
02:38:15.530 --> 02:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
this tiny four dollar change is just
 
02:38:17.570 --> 02:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
killing an account that we no longer
 
02:38:21.469 --> 02:38:21.479 align:start position:0%
need when we get to line 82
 
02:38:23.870 --> 02:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
um this is money that's going to help
 
02:38:26.929 --> 02:38:26.939 align:start position:0%
fund mobile crisis
 
02:38:26.939 --> 02:38:28.190 align:start position:0%
fund mobile crisis
um

02:38:28.190 --> 02:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:31.070 --> 02:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
centers they're they're basically uh
 
02:38:33.950 --> 02:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
Decked Out vans that can help provide
 
02:38:36.710 --> 02:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
mobile psychiatric services around the
 
02:38:39.410 --> 02:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
state this this will bring the total
 
02:38:42.950 --> 02:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
number of mobile crisis centers uh up to
 
02:38:45.410 --> 02:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
five and
 
02:38:49.550 --> 02:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
um these are really a great Gap filler
 
02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of the clinical whole that that
 
02:38:54.770 --> 02:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
we've had in our Behavioral Health
 
02:38:58.610 --> 02:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
Network and uh I I do think that in the
 
02:39:02.690 --> 02:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
years to come we really need to um make
 
02:39:05.630 --> 02:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
sure that these continue to be a good
 
02:39:08.030 --> 02:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
investment because we are investing a
 
02:39:10.969 --> 02:39:10.979 align:start position:0%
lot of money in these and so continuing
 
02:39:12.830 --> 02:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
to keep our eye on the ball here will
 
02:39:14.990 --> 02:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
will matter
 
02:39:18.370 --> 02:39:18.380 align:start position:0%
um and then from line
 
02:39:23.690 --> 02:39:23.700 align:start position:0%
83 down uh were or is that 83 that's 84.
 
02:39:27.230 --> 02:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
84 down we're uh transferring some audit
 
02:39:29.690 --> 02:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
positions around between accounting
 
02:39:29.700 --> 02:39:31.130 align:start position:0%
positions around between accounting
units

02:39:31.130 --> 02:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
units
 
02:39:32.870 --> 02:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
um I think that accounts for everything
 
02:39:35.349 --> 02:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
down to line
 
02:39:41.270 --> 02:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
95 and then 95 were just adjusting a
 
02:39:44.050 --> 02:39:44.060 align:start position:0%
source of funds to recognize
 
02:39:46.790 --> 02:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
administrative fees that were earned in
 
02:39:48.530 --> 02:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
that account
 
02:39:53.090 --> 02:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
and then the last page uh 96 is just the
 
02:39:56.210 --> 02:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
the opposite of that transfer just to
 
02:39:59.929 --> 02:39:59.939 align:start position:0%
show the funds moving from A to B and Mr
 
02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
chairman with that uh I've completed the
 
02:40:05.690 --> 02:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
briefing on the changes in hp1 from
 
02:40:08.570 --> 02:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:11.450 --> 02:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards are
 
02:40:13.610 --> 02:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
there any questions
 
02:40:19.910 --> 02:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:30.710 --> 02:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:45.380 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:40:45.380 --> 02:40:45.390 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:45.390 --> 02:40:47.530 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:40:47.530 --> 02:40:47.540 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:40:50.750 --> 02:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
yes we can hear you
 
02:40:57.680 --> 02:40:57.690 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:57.690 --> 02:41:02.389 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:41:02.389 --> 02:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:08.830 --> 02:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
all right it's a line 64 refers to
 
02:41:12.349 --> 02:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
a 226
 
02:41:12.359 --> 02:41:15.230 align:start position:0%
a 226
position

02:41:15.230 --> 02:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:17.630 --> 02:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
um being eliminated at Health and Human
 
02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:18.770 align:start position:0%
um being eliminated at Health and Human
Services

02:41:18.770 --> 02:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
Services
 
02:41:20.650 --> 02:41:20.660 align:start position:0%
which equals about
 
02:41:24.290 --> 02:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
22.6 million dollars
 
02:41:28.670 --> 02:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
and it should be should be also noted
 
02:41:30.770 --> 02:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
that in the governor's budget he had
 
02:41:33.490 --> 02:41:33.500 align:start position:0%
eliminated 88 positions
 
02:41:37.429 --> 02:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
so for a total of 314.
 
02:41:39.349 --> 02:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
is with the total elimination of
 
02:41:39.359 --> 02:41:41.330 align:start position:0%
is with the total elimination of
positions

02:41:41.330 --> 02:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
positions
 
02:41:43.429 --> 02:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
in the department these are back of the
 
02:41:43.439 --> 02:41:44.650 align:start position:0%
in the department these are back of the
budget

02:41:44.650 --> 02:41:44.660 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:41:47.389 --> 02:41:47.399 align:start position:0%
reductions so so the numbers you're
 
02:41:49.790 --> 02:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
referring to I I don't see on the horse
 
02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
blanket for line 55 and
 
02:41:59.990 --> 02:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:02.690 --> 02:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
there there are no numbers that I see on
 
02:42:02.700 --> 02:42:03.790 align:start position:0%
there there are no numbers that I see on
line

02:42:03.790 --> 02:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:07.090 align:start position:0%
54.60 that would make a difference
 
02:42:07.090 --> 02:42:09.730 align:start position:0%
54.60 that would make a difference
[Music]

02:42:09.730 --> 02:42:09.740 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:42:12.650 --> 02:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:42:15.349 --> 02:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
um I was going to
 
02:42:15.359 --> 02:42:16.010 align:start position:0%
um I was going to
um

02:42:16.010 --> 02:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:19.130 --> 02:42:19.140 align:start position:0%
take after this horse blanket I was
 
02:42:22.010 --> 02:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
going to speak to this other document
 
02:42:24.889 --> 02:42:24.899 align:start position:0%
where all the amendments are included
 
02:42:27.530 --> 02:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
and so so the amendment that you're
 
02:42:31.010 --> 02:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
referring to is also going to be
 
02:42:34.010 --> 02:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
discussed here in a moment in the in the
 
02:42:37.630 --> 02:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
next set of of
 
02:42:40.070 --> 02:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
hp2 amendments
 
02:42:42.050 --> 02:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
well these are both back of the budget
 
02:42:44.750 --> 02:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and the back of the budget cut is
 
02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
is is referred to in this package
 
02:42:50.750 --> 02:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
related to hb1 I just think it should be
 
02:42:53.450 --> 02:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
no I I can do those now
 
02:42:57.410 --> 02:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
um there is there is a a package uh that
 
02:43:00.230 --> 02:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
the division three has uh called house
 
02:43:03.770 --> 02:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
finance division three uh House Bill one
 
02:43:07.070 --> 02:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
and two proposed amendments uh there are
 
02:43:10.610 --> 02:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
uh two new sections added you can see
 
02:43:12.110 --> 02:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
them there
 
02:43:15.650 --> 02:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
um and then you can go to the next page
 
02:43:21.010 --> 02:43:21.020 align:start position:0%
um what what this uh Amendment 51 did
 
02:43:23.690 --> 02:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
and I can see why it's appropriate to
 
02:43:25.610 --> 02:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
talk about it now thank you so much for
 
02:43:27.349 --> 02:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
02:43:29.630 --> 02:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
um uh we
 
02:43:33.830 --> 02:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
if you look at how many people there
 
02:43:37.969 --> 02:43:37.979 align:start position:0%
were in the department as of 11 March
 
02:43:40.330 --> 02:43:40.340 align:start position:0%
there was
 
02:43:43.010 --> 02:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
2651 people and this is going to be a
 
02:43:44.510 --> 02:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
lot of numbers for those paying
 
02:43:47.330 --> 02:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
attention at home so
 
02:43:51.349 --> 02:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
um so they have a tremendous number of
 
02:43:51.359 --> 02:43:52.730 align:start position:0%
um so they have a tremendous number of
vacancies

02:43:52.730 --> 02:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
vacancies
 
02:43:55.389 --> 02:43:55.399 align:start position:0%
every single Department
 
02:43:57.830 --> 02:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
reported well pretty much every single
 
02:44:00.410 --> 02:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
Department reported having a difficult
 
02:44:03.670 --> 02:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
time because New Hampshire has severe
 
02:44:06.110 --> 02:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortages in health care
 
02:44:10.849 --> 02:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
providers people who in our delegations
 
02:44:13.070 --> 02:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
work with our nursing homes and people
 
02:44:17.110 --> 02:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
on HHS who work with Workforce issues
 
02:44:20.630 --> 02:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
for Health Care also know that Statewide
 
02:44:24.410 --> 02:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
we have a very significant problem with
 
02:44:27.410 --> 02:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
they're just not being enough health
 
02:44:31.550 --> 02:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
care providers in our in our system to
 
02:44:35.150 --> 02:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
um to to fill every position that's
 
02:44:38.150 --> 02:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
needed between the state between the
 
02:44:42.050 --> 02:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
counties between the local civilian
 
02:44:44.389 --> 02:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facilities we're all
 
02:44:47.030 --> 02:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
competing for the same people so what
 
02:44:51.190 --> 02:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
hb1 this amendment uh
 
02:44:58.010 --> 02:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
0936 does is it recognizes that
 
02:45:02.389 --> 02:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
we could in theory try to hire thousands
 
02:45:05.929 --> 02:45:05.939 align:start position:0%
of more people but in reality the number
 
02:45:08.389 --> 02:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
that we can actually hire is much limit
 
02:45:11.090 --> 02:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
much more limited because there is a
 
02:45:13.270 --> 02:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage and competition
 
02:45:15.830 --> 02:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
across the entire Health Care delivery
 
02:45:19.490 --> 02:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
spectrum and so with an authorization
 
02:45:22.969 --> 02:45:22.979 align:start position:0%
that came over of three thousand two
 
02:45:25.910 --> 02:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
hundred and twenty six positions of
 
02:45:28.429 --> 02:45:28.439 align:start position:0%
which 88 were unfunded
 
02:45:31.610 --> 02:45:31.620 align:start position:0%
if you subtract that 88 you're down
 
02:45:34.250 --> 02:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
around 31.40
 
02:45:36.170 --> 02:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
and then when you take a look at the
 
02:45:39.349 --> 02:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
fact that we are as a policy decision
 
02:45:41.870 --> 02:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
have decided to close the sununu center
 
02:45:46.190 --> 02:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
that will free up another 96 people so
 
02:45:49.929 --> 02:45:49.939 align:start position:0%
if you if you take that 88 and that 96
 
02:45:55.250 --> 02:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
then we're down to 3042. uh this hp1
 
02:45:58.070 --> 02:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
recognizes those reductions and then
 
02:46:00.530 --> 02:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
takes an additional 42.
 
02:46:03.590 --> 02:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
so to make it an even three thousand now
 
02:46:07.370 --> 02:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
what does that 3000 represent well given
 
02:46:11.650 --> 02:46:11.660 align:start position:0%
the current vacancy rate as of 11 March
 
02:46:14.469 --> 02:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
over the approximately
 
02:46:18.530 --> 02:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
350 vacancies the department can go out
 
02:46:21.889 --> 02:46:21.899 align:start position:0%
and fill 88 percent of them
 
02:46:25.670 --> 02:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
before they hit the ceiling so so while
 
02:46:30.050 --> 02:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
it looks like a reduction on paper I
 
02:46:31.730 --> 02:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
think in reality
 
02:46:34.250 --> 02:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
there is a tremendous amount of hiring
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
new hires that the department can do
 
02:46:40.730 --> 02:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
and I think there's anyone who's ever
 
02:46:44.630 --> 02:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
worked in a corporation knows uh when
 
02:46:47.870 --> 02:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
you hire a large contention of new
 
02:46:51.889 --> 02:46:51.899 align:start position:0%
people it takes a very long time to get
 
02:46:51.899 --> 02:46:52.690 align:start position:0%
people it takes a very long time to get
them

02:46:52.690 --> 02:46:52.700 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:46:56.570 --> 02:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
trained and acclimated to the work
 
02:46:58.550 --> 02:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
culture and the environment and becoming
 
02:47:02.750 --> 02:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
productive and so hp1 in my view is
 
02:47:06.710 --> 02:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
recognition of the reality that the
 
02:47:09.170 --> 02:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
workforce is limited and the department
 
02:47:13.429 --> 02:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
still has in reality a lot of room to
 
02:47:16.370 --> 02:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
grow before they hit this new threshold
 
02:47:19.429 --> 02:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
don't answer your question
 
02:47:23.389 --> 02:47:23.399 align:start position:0%
yes and and the next section 65 I think
 
02:47:27.889 --> 02:47:27.899 align:start position:0%
it's hard to hear you I'm sorry 65.
 
02:47:31.250 --> 02:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
so is that is is that the uh the
 
02:47:35.929 --> 02:47:35.939 align:start position:0%
financial cut yes okay so so then
 
02:47:38.690 --> 02:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
um uh thank you for the question the if
 
02:47:40.730 --> 02:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
you go back a page whoever's doing the
 
02:47:42.650 --> 02:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
screen did you go back a page real quick
 
02:47:45.290 --> 02:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
uh the other way somebody who's doing
 
02:47:47.570 --> 02:47:47.580 align:start position:0%
the screen sharing go back
 
02:47:50.450 --> 02:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
okay so then the second line item these
 
02:47:54.050 --> 02:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
two are really uh twins they they go
 
02:47:56.090 --> 02:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
they their sign meets twins they go
 
02:47:56.100 --> 02:47:57.530 align:start position:0%
they their sign meets twins they go
together

02:47:57.530 --> 02:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:48:00.950 --> 02:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
um the the um the budget reduction so so
 
02:48:03.590 --> 02:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
now we can go to page three on the
 
02:48:06.050 --> 02:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
screen share to see the amendment
 
02:48:11.349 --> 02:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
and what this does is it um
 
02:48:16.429 --> 02:48:16.439 align:start position:0%
recognizes that the department uh can
 
02:48:20.690 --> 02:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
manage a higher lag and make some
 
02:48:23.690 --> 02:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
priority decisions on where to focus
 
02:48:26.750 --> 02:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
their resources and so in the first year
 
02:48:29.090 --> 02:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
of the budget it
 
02:48:30.830 --> 02:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
um requires the back of the budget
 
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
reduction of 30 million dollars
 
02:48:38.210 --> 02:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
uh and in the second year 20 million for
 
02:48:42.170 --> 02:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
50 million for the biennium and uh in
 
02:48:46.190 --> 02:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
doing so we prioritized and there's a
 
02:48:48.469 --> 02:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
lot of words here but I'm just you know
 
02:48:51.530 --> 02:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
so just generally the description is we
 
02:48:54.530 --> 02:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
per we prioritized
 
02:48:57.110 --> 02:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
direct Health Care Services
 
02:48:59.450 --> 02:48:59.460 align:start position:0%
where there is a patient that needs
 
02:49:02.330 --> 02:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
treatment we've protected the governor's
 
02:49:05.809 --> 02:49:05.819 align:start position:0%
budget and those to to be specific those
 
02:49:08.630 --> 02:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
areas include all developmental services
 
02:49:12.290 --> 02:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
to include acquired brain disorders and
 
02:49:14.990 --> 02:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
children's In-Home Support Services the
 
02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
children's health insurance program and
 
02:49:19.969 --> 02:49:19.979 align:start position:0%
the county programs to include the state
 
02:49:21.889 --> 02:49:21.899 align:start position:0%
share of funding for nursing facilities
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
another long-term care facilities such
 
02:49:30.070 --> 02:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
as the CFI program so we we in this
 
02:49:33.950 --> 02:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
amendment are protecting
 
02:49:36.889 --> 02:49:36.899 align:start position:0%
every place that the department is
 
02:49:40.309 --> 02:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
paying for direct health care for New
 
02:49:42.830 --> 02:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's beneficiaries which which
 
02:49:46.670 --> 02:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
leaves them an opportunity to prioritize
 
02:49:49.730 --> 02:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
among their other programs and and
 
02:49:52.849 --> 02:49:52.859 align:start position:0%
invest where they need to now this is
 
02:49:54.530 --> 02:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
still more money than they're going to
 
02:49:57.410 --> 02:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
spend in the current year
 
02:49:59.389 --> 02:49:59.399 align:start position:0%
um when it all said and done it's not as
 
02:50:01.309 --> 02:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
big as their budget for the current year
 
02:50:04.490 --> 02:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
but it's but when we look at the actual
 
02:50:06.950 --> 02:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
spending this is a higher budget than
 
02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:08.210 align:start position:0%
spending this is a higher budget than
that

02:50:08.210 --> 02:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:50:08.220 --> 02:50:09.050 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:50:09.050 --> 02:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:13.140 --> 02:50:13.150 align:start position:0%
what else did I want to say about that
 
02:50:13.150 --> 02:50:14.889 align:start position:0%
what else did I want to say about that
[Music]

02:50:14.889 --> 02:50:14.899 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:50:18.349 --> 02:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
I think those are my main points do you
 
02:50:21.110 --> 02:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-on
 
02:50:23.630 --> 02:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
no I'm sure that we've covered this
 
02:50:26.270 --> 02:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
02:50:28.429 --> 02:50:28.439 align:start position:0%
before I come to representative hatch
 
02:50:30.050 --> 02:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
I've been watching representative
 
02:50:31.849 --> 02:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
nordgren has her hand up so
 
02:50:33.230 --> 02:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren and then
 
02:50:35.270 --> 02:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative hatch
 
02:50:38.090 --> 02:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thank you
 
02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for your
 
02:50:40.080 --> 02:50:41.990 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for your
presentation

02:50:41.990 --> 02:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
02:50:45.230 --> 02:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
um I did want to clarify for the other
 
02:50:47.750 --> 02:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh when you
 
02:50:51.650 --> 02:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
spoke uh about the amendment on page
 
02:50:54.170 --> 02:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
three uh
 
02:50:56.650 --> 02:50:56.660 align:start position:0%
about the Personnel related
 
02:50:58.910 --> 02:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and the number of
 
02:51:02.630 --> 02:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
positions that were being deleted
 
02:51:04.030 --> 02:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
um I think you
 
02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh we're erroneous in one of your
 
02:51:11.389 --> 02:51:11.399 align:start position:0%
comments this sununu Center employees on
 
02:51:15.410 --> 02:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
page 29 of House Bill 2 are given
 
02:51:18.110 --> 02:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
priority for being hired and we're
 
02:51:21.410 --> 02:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
hoping to retrain those people who lose
 
02:51:24.230 --> 02:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
their employment there so I don't think
 
02:51:28.610 --> 02:51:28.620 align:start position:0%
they should be counted in that number
 
02:51:31.010 --> 02:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
um we're hoping they're not
 
02:51:35.389 --> 02:51:35.399 align:start position:0%
um I also wanted to call a question on
 
02:51:37.309 --> 02:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
page two
 
02:51:37.319 --> 02:51:38.170 align:start position:0%
page two
um

02:51:38.170 --> 02:51:38.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:43.190 --> 02:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
row 33 Family Planning program
 
02:51:48.490 --> 02:51:48.500 align:start position:0%
um I don't really have any definition of
 
02:51:52.610 --> 02:51:52.620 align:start position:0%
what providers would be awarded this
 
02:51:55.309 --> 02:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
money I don't see anything that
 
02:51:58.429 --> 02:51:58.439 align:start position:0%
clarifies it in House Bill 2 I was just
 
02:52:02.110 --> 02:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
hoping for clarification of what sort of
 
02:52:05.889 --> 02:52:05.899 align:start position:0%
uh people you would want to
 
02:52:10.309 --> 02:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
attract to receive these funds thank you
 
02:52:13.309 --> 02:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
okay so I'll do that second question
 
02:52:13.319 --> 02:52:14.630 align:start position:0%
okay so I'll do that second question
first

02:52:14.630 --> 02:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:52:17.990 --> 02:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
um if um when we were reviewed and
 
02:52:20.150 --> 02:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
approved this in committee there was a
 
02:52:23.809 --> 02:52:23.819 align:start position:0%
footnote associated with it in hb1 and
 
02:52:26.269 --> 02:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
the footnote I'm not seeing the footnote
 
02:52:29.590 --> 02:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
there but the footnote as I recall
 
02:52:31.990 --> 02:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
stipulated that
 
02:52:35.330 --> 02:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
no more than ten thousand dollars could
 
02:52:37.730 --> 02:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
be granted per
 
02:52:42.710 --> 02:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
new awardee uh of a contract so so the
 
02:52:46.790 --> 02:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
idea is if if you're a
 
02:52:50.570 --> 02:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
federally funded health clinic and you
 
02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
haven't been competing for State Family
 
02:52:56.450 --> 02:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
Planning dollars if you became a
 
02:52:58.849 --> 02:52:58.859 align:start position:0%
competitor and you were to win a bid and
 
02:53:01.929 --> 02:53:01.939 align:start position:0%
you were new then there there might be
 
02:53:06.230 --> 02:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
some one-time costs associated with
 
02:53:08.809 --> 02:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
getting into the program that that that
 
02:53:11.769 --> 02:53:11.779 align:start position:0%
up to ten thousand dollars would defray
 
02:53:14.690 --> 02:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
or otherwise it would serve as a bonus
 
02:53:17.570 --> 02:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
to increase competition and that that
 
02:53:19.670 --> 02:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
line was in
 
02:53:23.650 --> 02:53:23.660 align:start position:0%
um the footnote for hb1
 
02:53:26.929 --> 02:53:26.939 align:start position:0%
thank you may I ask a further question
 
02:53:31.630 --> 02:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
sure so so just a clarification so these
 
02:53:34.670 --> 02:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
organizations would have to previously
 
02:53:38.510 --> 02:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
or currently have Federal funding for
 
02:53:40.790 --> 02:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
their organization Federal Government
 
02:53:44.030 --> 02:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
funding no it's just that the these
 
02:53:46.929 --> 02:53:46.939 align:start position:0%
would be new awardees of state federal
 
02:53:50.570 --> 02:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
state Family Planning programs that's
 
02:53:52.730 --> 02:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
what that footnote says
 
02:53:55.250 --> 02:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
but we don't have any other criteria an
 
02:53:57.710 --> 02:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
example of one that could compete not
 
02:54:00.130 --> 02:54:00.140 align:start position:0%
that that's an exhaustive list
 
02:54:02.809 --> 02:54:02.819 align:start position:0%
but pretty much anyone who wants to
 
02:54:06.050 --> 02:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
compete for Family Planning counseling
 
02:54:08.990 --> 02:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
and programs if they're a new awardee
 
02:54:11.510 --> 02:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
they would be eligible for up to ten
 
02:54:15.660 --> 02:54:15.670 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per awardee new awardee
 
02:54:15.670 --> 02:54:17.090 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per awardee new awardee
[Music]

02:54:17.090 --> 02:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:54:20.030 --> 02:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
and that that was in the footnote that
 
02:54:22.309 --> 02:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
we reviewed in division three committee
 
02:54:24.830 --> 02:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
that was part of the discussion on on
 
02:54:26.450 --> 02:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
that line item
 
02:54:28.790 --> 02:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
yes I see it here in my papers thank you
 
02:54:28.800 --> 02:54:32.570 align:start position:0%
yes I see it here in my papers thank you
sure

02:54:32.570 --> 02:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:36.170 --> 02:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
or are they said other questions on HP
 
02:54:38.150 --> 02:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
one yes
 
02:54:40.070 --> 02:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
all right represent if you are you
 
02:54:42.950 --> 02:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
finished representative yes thank you
 
02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:46.890 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:46.890 --> 02:54:52.969 align:start position:0%

02:54:55.910 --> 02:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
changing just as long
 
02:54:57.230 --> 02:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
as well performance between the
 
02:55:01.929 --> 02:55:01.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:04.309 --> 02:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
so that's all that you are saying
 
02:55:08.110 --> 02:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
correctly there is an alignment to be
 
02:55:11.210 --> 02:55:11.220 align:start position:0%
hospitals other health care providers
 
02:55:15.469 --> 02:55:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:17.570 --> 02:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
IP and nurses
 
02:55:20.269 --> 02:55:20.279 align:start position:0%

02:55:20.279 --> 02:55:29.990 align:start position:0%
physical therapists excellent

02:55:32.090 --> 02:55:32.100 align:start position:0%
Healthcare professionals

02:55:46.269 --> 02:55:46.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:48.830 --> 02:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
so they aren't
 
02:55:52.610 --> 02:55:52.620 align:start position:0%
okay go back to high school algebra
 
02:55:55.790 --> 02:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
where they had a Venn diagram and I
 
02:55:55.800 --> 02:55:58.750 align:start position:0%
where they had a Venn diagram and I
think

02:55:58.750 --> 02:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:01.969 --> 02:56:01.979 align:start position:0%
no I I I'm just trying to answer your
 
02:56:03.889 --> 02:56:03.899 align:start position:0%
question for the other people who are
 
02:56:08.570 --> 02:56:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:11.090 --> 02:56:11.100 align:start position:0%
sorry to cut cut off but on Zoom we
 
02:56:12.830 --> 02:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
could not hear representative hatch's
 
02:56:14.870 --> 02:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
question I don't know if he's near a
 
02:56:17.269 --> 02:56:17.279 align:start position:0%
microphone but I'll repeat uh
 
02:56:19.309 --> 02:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
representative hatch's question as I
 
02:56:20.750 --> 02:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
understand it since he doesn't have a
 
02:56:20.760 --> 02:56:22.130 align:start position:0%
understand it since he doesn't have a
microphone

02:56:22.130 --> 02:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
um but the question is I understand it
 
02:56:28.849 --> 02:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
is I made a comment that New Hampshire
 
02:56:32.630 --> 02:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
has Workforce shortages and that there's
 
02:56:35.750 --> 02:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh competition for scarce Manpower
 
02:56:38.809 --> 02:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
between the state agencies County
 
02:56:41.750 --> 02:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
agencies and civilian Health Care
 
02:56:44.809 --> 02:56:44.819 align:start position:0%
organizations and so his question was
 
02:56:48.290 --> 02:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
meant to clarify my remark to whether or
 
02:56:51.650 --> 02:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
not there was an exact overlap between
 
02:56:54.410 --> 02:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
the types of people that the state needs
 
02:56:58.490 --> 02:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
to hire in the DHHS and those that are
 
02:57:00.550 --> 02:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
needed by the counties and by the
 
02:57:03.349 --> 02:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
civilian providers and so he's asking me
 
02:57:05.809 --> 02:57:05.819 align:start position:0%
to clarify that is that a fair
 
02:57:08.510 --> 02:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
characterization okay so representative
 
02:57:10.250 --> 02:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
Patrick grease that that's a fair
 
02:57:10.260 --> 02:57:11.469 align:start position:0%
Patrick grease that that's a fair
summary

02:57:11.469 --> 02:57:11.479 align:start position:0%
summary
 
02:57:15.050 --> 02:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
and so I I would go back to anyone who's
 
02:57:17.809 --> 02:57:17.819 align:start position:0%
seen those Venn diagrams where there's
 
02:57:20.870 --> 02:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
two different sets and they they have an
 
02:57:23.210 --> 02:57:23.220 align:start position:0%
overlap in the middle and they have
 
02:57:26.570 --> 02:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
differences on in each of the sets as
 
02:57:30.230 --> 02:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
well and so that that kind of classic uh
 
02:57:34.630 --> 02:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
two set Venn diagram I think would help
 
02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:36.849 align:start position:0%
two set Venn diagram I think would help
graphically

02:57:36.849 --> 02:57:36.859 align:start position:0%
graphically
 
02:57:39.530 --> 02:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
represent part of the answer is that
 
02:57:41.990 --> 02:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
there is a tremendous amount of overlap
 
02:57:45.590 --> 02:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
the the more that you get on to direct
 
02:57:49.330 --> 02:57:49.340 align:start position:0%
Hands-On providers like nurses
 
02:57:51.849 --> 02:57:51.859 align:start position:0%
behavioral specialists
 
02:57:55.670 --> 02:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
LPNs and the like then then yeah there's
 
02:57:59.690 --> 02:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of overlap now now in the
 
02:58:03.950 --> 02:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
um at the state level you can see more
 
02:58:06.230 --> 02:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
administrators you can also see a lot of
 
02:58:08.510 --> 02:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
Public Health Specialists
 
02:58:12.290 --> 02:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
and so there there is a distinction also
 
02:58:14.090 --> 02:58:14.100 align:start position:0%
in the um
 
02:58:16.670 --> 02:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
from the state to the civilian health
 
02:58:19.010 --> 02:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
care provider but but there's a
 
02:58:21.410 --> 02:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of overlap and and I
 
02:58:24.769 --> 02:58:24.779 align:start position:0%
think I think the bigger point a bigger
 
02:58:27.830 --> 02:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
point that that needs emphasis is that
 
02:58:32.210 --> 02:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
the entire state is suffering from a
 
02:58:34.490 --> 02:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
long-term chronic
 
02:58:37.010 --> 02:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
issue we're just not having enough
 
02:58:39.889 --> 02:58:39.899 align:start position:0%
health care providers in the state to
 
02:58:41.950 --> 02:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
meet all the demands of all of the jobs
 
02:58:46.130 --> 02:58:46.140 align:start position:0%
and and I for one would rather to have
 
02:58:49.490 --> 02:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
scarce medical resources out in the
 
02:58:52.910 --> 02:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
communities touching patients rather
 
02:58:55.210 --> 02:58:55.220 align:start position:0%
than in a department
 
02:58:58.670 --> 02:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
on the phone you know coordinating care
 
02:59:02.389 --> 02:59:02.399 align:start position:0%
between other care providers I I I have
 
02:59:05.210 --> 02:59:05.220 align:start position:0%
a bias towards direct Hands-On Health
 
02:59:05.220 --> 02:59:06.349 align:start position:0%
a bias towards direct Hands-On Health
Care

02:59:06.349 --> 02:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
Care
 
02:59:10.490 --> 02:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:12.889 --> 02:59:12.899 align:start position:0%
he does not think that answered his
 
02:59:16.309 --> 02:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
question really but I'm just repeating
 
02:59:20.150 --> 02:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:22.190 --> 02:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
all right we have representative Porter
 
02:59:23.809 --> 02:59:23.819 align:start position:0%
with her hand up and representative
 
02:59:25.910 --> 02:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
noidgren your hand is still up is there
 
02:59:29.330 --> 02:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:32.330 --> 02:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
yes I had a follow-up question but you
 
02:59:34.670 --> 02:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
can take representative Porter first
 
02:59:36.469 --> 02:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
all right representative Porter for a
 
02:59:38.929 --> 02:59:38.939 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:59:41.090 --> 02:59:41.100 align:start position:0%
you representative Edwards I'm not sure
 
02:59:42.950 --> 02:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
you can answer this question for me I
 
02:59:44.809 --> 02:59:44.819 align:start position:0%
know at the county level we have
 
02:59:47.210 --> 02:59:47.220 align:start position:0%
struggled with um
 
02:59:50.450 --> 02:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
getting people to work in our nursing
 
02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
home for example
 
02:59:56.269 --> 02:59:56.279 align:start position:0%
um is there a does the state set a
 
02:59:58.790 --> 02:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
certain pay scale
 
03:00:02.349 --> 03:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
which the anybody that has Medicaid
 
03:00:06.769 --> 03:00:06.779 align:start position:0%
reimbursement needs to follow or are
 
03:00:10.790 --> 03:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
the County's free to pay what they want
 
03:00:13.030 --> 03:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
versus the state
 
03:00:16.429 --> 03:00:16.439 align:start position:0%
DHHS pay what they want is that does
 
03:00:20.150 --> 03:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
that question make sense I guess my
 
03:00:22.070 --> 03:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
question is is there a unified pay scale
 
03:00:26.170 --> 03:00:26.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:28.790 --> 03:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
you know health care workers you're
 
03:00:30.889 --> 03:00:30.899 align:start position:0%
asking me a question that I'm a little
 
03:00:34.190 --> 03:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
leery to answer because I I think I know
 
03:00:37.070 --> 03:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
about a 90 answer your question I'm not
 
03:00:40.370 --> 03:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
a I'm not a Medicaid billing expert and
 
03:00:42.650 --> 03:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
so if you'll accept a little bit of
 
03:00:44.750 --> 03:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
Tolerance in my answer the way it is
 
03:00:49.910 --> 03:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
essentially is that the providers set
 
03:00:53.269 --> 03:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
their rates uh based on what they what
 
03:00:56.150 --> 03:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
they think they they need to charge and
 
03:01:00.050 --> 03:01:00.060 align:start position:0%
and different payers will
 
03:01:00.060 --> 03:01:00.910 align:start position:0%
and different payers will
um

03:01:00.910 --> 03:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:05.210 --> 03:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
reimburse their rates based on their own
 
03:01:07.370 --> 03:01:07.380 align:start position:0%
formulas commercial insurance companies
 
03:01:10.429 --> 03:01:10.439 align:start position:0%
tend to pay the best uh and then
 
03:01:15.170 --> 03:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
Medicare uh pays less but Medicaid pays
 
03:01:17.950 --> 03:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
the least and so in general the Medicaid
 
03:01:22.370 --> 03:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
rate is set whether it's set at the
 
03:01:24.410 --> 03:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
state level or set at the federal level
 
03:01:26.690 --> 03:01:26.700 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm a little
 
03:01:30.050 --> 03:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
um you know gray I'm not sure but it but
 
03:01:34.550 --> 03:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
the the Medicaid rate scale gets set by
 
03:01:36.530 --> 03:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
a central entity working for one of the
 
03:01:40.550 --> 03:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
government levels and I believe a few
 
03:01:42.070 --> 03:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
03:01:43.990 --> 03:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:01:46.969 --> 03:01:46.979 align:start position:0%
uh established that we would pay the
 
03:01:49.429 --> 03:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
same Medicaid rate throughout the state
 
03:01:51.349 --> 03:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't have distinctions for
 
03:01:54.170 --> 03:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
Manchester versus Coos County I believe
 
03:01:56.510 --> 03:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
that's true I remember that I think for
 
03:01:58.910 --> 03:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
my HHS days
 
03:02:00.710 --> 03:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
um there's another thing that's really
 
03:02:03.349 --> 03:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
close to what you're asking and that is
 
03:02:07.790 --> 03:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh does the state ever
 
03:02:12.410 --> 03:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
decide to enter into a rate agreement
 
03:02:14.950 --> 03:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
with different kinds of care providers
 
03:02:20.269 --> 03:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
and in fact we do and uh we have a
 
03:02:25.030 --> 03:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
program called CFI and for some the
 
03:02:27.769 --> 03:02:27.779 align:start position:0%
representative Waller can you refresh me
 
03:02:30.410 --> 03:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
on what CFI means
 
03:02:30.420 --> 03:02:30.969 align:start position:0%
on what CFI means
um

03:02:30.969 --> 03:02:30.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:33.910 --> 03:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
choices for Independence choices for
 
03:02:36.590 --> 03:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
Independence thank you sir uh choices
 
03:02:39.170 --> 03:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
for Independence is a program that that
 
03:02:42.410 --> 03:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
helps the elderly stay in their home for
 
03:02:44.630 --> 03:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
a longer period of time before going
 
03:02:47.750 --> 03:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
into a Skilled Nursing Facility so these
 
03:02:51.349 --> 03:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
choices for Independence uh help the
 
03:02:54.110 --> 03:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
families uh keep mom and dad at home
 
03:02:57.889 --> 03:02:57.899 align:start position:0%
longer and and but do show up regularly
 
03:03:00.769 --> 03:03:00.779 align:start position:0%
to provide care and support the state
 
03:03:03.590 --> 03:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
has set the rate for those kinds of
 
03:03:06.349 --> 03:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
services in one of the discussions that
 
03:03:08.929 --> 03:03:08.939 align:start position:0%
we had in this cycle was whether or not
 
03:03:11.570 --> 03:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
the the rate that has recently been
 
03:03:13.269 --> 03:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
increased is really going to be enough
 
03:03:16.610 --> 03:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
and and so we're we're actually
 
03:03:19.610 --> 03:03:19.620 align:start position:0%
intending to work uh provide our
 
03:03:23.570 --> 03:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
community for CFI and the Senate to see
 
03:03:25.969 --> 03:03:25.979 align:start position:0%
if they may be able to improve upon the
 
03:03:28.429 --> 03:03:28.439 align:start position:0%
rate that's been established so so it's
 
03:03:30.530 --> 03:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
it's at least a couple different ways
 
03:03:32.090 --> 03:03:32.100 align:start position:0%
and and I hope that answers your
 
03:03:34.670 --> 03:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
question because I can't possibly tap
 
03:03:37.190 --> 03:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
dance on that answer any longer
 
03:03:39.110 --> 03:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:03:42.590 --> 03:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative neudgren for a question
 
03:03:44.450 --> 03:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:03:46.309 --> 03:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to go back to
 
03:03:46.319 --> 03:03:47.870 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to go back to
representative

03:03:47.870 --> 03:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:03:51.429 --> 03:03:51.439 align:start position:0%
um Edwards and my concern about
 
03:03:54.250 --> 03:03:54.260 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
03:03:59.090 --> 03:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
of the Personnel issue in the sununu
 
03:04:01.790 --> 03:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
center I think I'm not sure you answered
 
03:04:03.590 --> 03:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
that question of my concern that we
 
03:04:06.230 --> 03:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be counting them in our list
 
03:04:10.370 --> 03:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
of the number of employees that will be
 
03:04:13.969 --> 03:04:13.979 align:start position:0%
um cut because I I'm thinking we don't
 
03:04:16.190 --> 03:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
want that to be something they would be
 
03:04:18.769 --> 03:04:18.779 align:start position:0%
concerned about because it is in-house
 
03:04:22.190 --> 03:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 on page 29. so we'll try to
 
03:04:25.130 --> 03:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
relocate them or give them training for
 
03:04:28.610 --> 03:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
other jobs in the state thank you right
 
03:04:31.490 --> 03:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
so so what I was trying to explain with
 
03:04:33.650 --> 03:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
that and and thank you for asking me to
 
03:04:35.929 --> 03:04:35.939 align:start position:0%
clarify because it can't it can and
 
03:04:39.650 --> 03:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
should be clarified and that is that the
 
03:04:41.990 --> 03:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate at the sununu center was
 
03:04:44.450 --> 03:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
was relatively small and then they were
 
03:04:48.230 --> 03:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
authorized about 96 people so that's 96
 
03:04:51.650 --> 03:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
people who are currently state employees
 
03:04:55.670 --> 03:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
that once the sununu center closes uh
 
03:04:59.210 --> 03:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
those positions there will no longer be
 
03:05:01.010 --> 03:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
authorized in the second year of this
 
03:05:03.530 --> 03:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
budget but you're absolutely right we
 
03:05:06.889 --> 03:05:06.899 align:start position:0%
made it a priority to retain and retrain
 
03:05:09.230 --> 03:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
those people and so so the point I was
 
03:05:12.889 --> 03:05:12.899 align:start position:0%
trying to make earlier is that that's
 
03:05:16.130 --> 03:05:16.140 align:start position:0%
that's Manpower that's going to be freed
 
03:05:20.330 --> 03:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
up for the commissioner to reprogram the
 
03:05:23.750 --> 03:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
higher priority needs and so so that
 
03:05:25.910 --> 03:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
that that was really my point is that
 
03:05:29.330 --> 03:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
for the folks who are concerned about
 
03:05:33.050 --> 03:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
um the head count being lower than the
 
03:05:36.050 --> 03:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
governor's budget I would say you know
 
03:05:39.170 --> 03:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
it's mitigated to an extent because here
 
03:05:42.290 --> 03:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
are 96 positions that can be reallocated
 
03:05:48.910 --> 03:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:51.769 --> 03:05:51.779 align:start position:0%
the people can stay they just need to be
 
03:05:54.349 --> 03:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
retrained and re you know cross-trained
 
03:05:59.269 --> 03:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
and and Rec categorized in some cases
 
03:06:01.330 --> 03:06:01.340 align:start position:0%
representative leishman for a question
 
03:06:04.550 --> 03:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman and uh thank the
 
03:06:07.250 --> 03:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
chair of division three for taking my
 
03:06:07.260 --> 03:06:08.389 align:start position:0%
chair of division three for taking my
question

03:06:08.389 --> 03:06:08.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:06:10.250 --> 03:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
so we've often heard that New Hampshire
 
03:06:12.650 --> 03:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
is a state that sends more money to
 
03:06:14.870 --> 03:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
Washington than we ever get back
 
03:06:18.950 --> 03:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
and I was looking at line 105 as far as
 
03:06:21.070 --> 03:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
federal funds and I see for the biennium
 
03:06:24.349 --> 03:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
there's 77 million dollars in federal
 
03:06:27.230 --> 03:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
funds it would be cut is this just
 
03:06:28.849 --> 03:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
increasing the amount of money we send
 
03:06:31.309 --> 03:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
to Washington or maybe you could explain
 
03:06:33.530 --> 03:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
the 77 million
 
03:06:35.630 --> 03:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
now that might impact what we're sending
 
03:06:38.830 --> 03:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
to Washington and getting back
 
03:06:49.849 --> 03:06:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:54.230 --> 03:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
all right you you may remember
 
03:06:57.170 --> 03:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
when I was talking about the Medicaid
 
03:07:00.590 --> 03:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
management information system and how we
 
03:07:05.809 --> 03:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
would be moving it from hp1 to hp2
 
03:07:09.710 --> 03:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
okay so so when you move it from HP one
 
03:07:11.650 --> 03:07:11.660 align:start position:0%
to hp2
 
03:07:16.190 --> 03:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
hb2 does not recognize the federal funds
 
03:07:18.830 --> 03:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
that go with it and I tried at the time
 
03:07:21.769 --> 03:07:21.779 align:start position:0%
just when I was talking about it to say
 
03:07:25.309 --> 03:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
that it looks like it's a really big cut
 
03:07:28.670 --> 03:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
in federal funding but in fact it's not
 
03:07:31.450 --> 03:07:31.460 align:start position:0%
because the joint legislative
 
03:07:34.490 --> 03:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee can will still accept
 
03:07:37.370 --> 03:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
that Federal money so the vast majority
 
03:07:41.990 --> 03:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
of this total of 77 million dollars is
 
03:07:44.929 --> 03:07:44.939 align:start position:0%
related to money that we're still going
 
03:07:47.990 --> 03:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
to bring in to the state
 
03:07:52.610 --> 03:07:52.620 align:start position:0%
through that hp2 trans transfer now if
 
03:07:54.769 --> 03:07:54.779 align:start position:0%
I'm not sitting at a desk where I can
 
03:07:57.230 --> 03:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
flip through this stuff quickly but let
 
03:07:59.870 --> 03:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
me try to find the exact number like if
 
03:08:02.570 --> 03:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
you go to line 24 on page one of that
 
03:08:05.650 --> 03:08:05.660 align:start position:0%
horse blanket down at the bottom it says
 
03:08:08.990 --> 03:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
67.6 million
 
03:08:10.210 --> 03:08:10.220 align:start position:0%
that that
 
03:08:13.010 --> 03:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
67.6 million looks like a cotton federal
 
03:08:13.020 --> 03:08:14.269 align:start position:0%
67.6 million looks like a cotton federal
funds

03:08:14.269 --> 03:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:08:16.730 --> 03:08:16.740 align:start position:0%
but it's it's it's not it's just taking
 
03:08:19.490 --> 03:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
it off of the hb1 spreadsheet because
 
03:08:21.650 --> 03:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
we'll still get it
 
03:08:25.130 --> 03:08:25.140 align:start position:0%
through the joint Crystal kinetic so so
 
03:08:30.050 --> 03:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
that 67.6 million Finds Its way to that
 
03:08:32.330 --> 03:08:32.340 align:start position:0%
line 105.
 
03:08:35.269 --> 03:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
in that line 105 again I'm just flipping
 
03:08:37.130 --> 03:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
through paper here
 
03:08:39.950 --> 03:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
is 77 million so all but 10 million
 
03:08:42.290 --> 03:08:42.300 align:start position:0%
pretty much is explained by that one
 
03:08:42.300 --> 03:08:43.550 align:start position:0%
pretty much is explained by that one
transaction

03:08:43.550 --> 03:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
transaction
 
03:08:46.250 --> 03:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
and and and and frankly I'm not prepared
 
03:08:47.929 --> 03:08:47.939 align:start position:0%
to answer where the other 10 million
 
03:08:50.030 --> 03:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
what's going on with the other 10 money
 
03:08:53.870 --> 03:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:00.110 --> 03:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:04.010 --> 03:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
you want to grab his mind oh yeah my
 
03:09:05.870 --> 03:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
question is a quick one
 
03:09:08.150 --> 03:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
um just simply usually
 
03:09:10.010 --> 03:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
um working in
 
03:09:12.830 --> 03:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
former employee of a state agency we
 
03:09:15.110 --> 03:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
were always told that when it's a budget
 
03:09:17.269 --> 03:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
time that you include all federal
 
03:09:20.510 --> 03:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
dollars if you anticipate them coming so
 
03:09:22.309 --> 03:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
in fact you don't have to go to fiscals
 
03:09:24.290 --> 03:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
so you have a total budget picture the
 
03:09:26.090 --> 03:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
way it should be could you explain why
 
03:09:27.469 --> 03:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
that you would take it out at this point
 
03:09:30.410 --> 03:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
or maybe I'm not understanding well okay
 
03:09:30.420 --> 03:09:32.150 align:start position:0%
or maybe I'm not understanding well okay
so

03:09:32.150 --> 03:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:09:32.160 --> 03:09:33.230 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:09:33.230 --> 03:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:36.230 --> 03:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
this was explained to me by both the
 
03:09:39.469 --> 03:09:39.479 align:start position:0%
Chief Financial Officer of of uh the
 
03:09:42.290 --> 03:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
department and our LBA assistant Mr
 
03:09:45.469 --> 03:09:45.479 align:start position:0%
Ripple and by moving the money out of
 
03:09:49.130 --> 03:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
hp1 we just don't reflect the federal
 
03:09:51.530 --> 03:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
money associated with that money those
 
03:09:54.550 --> 03:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
General funds we don't we don't
 
03:09:59.389 --> 03:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
show those federal funds on hb2 even
 
03:10:01.429 --> 03:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
though that they can come in so it's
 
03:10:05.210 --> 03:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
it's a state accounting method it's not
 
03:10:10.610 --> 03:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:16.969 --> 03:10:16.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:19.750 --> 03:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
03:10:22.969 --> 03:10:22.979 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards moves and
 
03:10:24.889 --> 03:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
representative Earth's second seconds
 
03:10:28.910 --> 03:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
that the report from division three
 
03:10:32.690 --> 03:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
on hb1 be accepted
 
03:10:35.210 --> 03:10:35.220 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
03:10:39.110 --> 03:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:41.870 --> 03:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Weiler
 
03:10:44.450 --> 03:10:44.460 align:start position:0%

it's my intention to vote against hb-1
and

03:10:47.030 --> 03:10:47.040 align:start position:0%

03:10:49.070 --> 03:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
you know I sat here this morning and I
 
03:10:51.530 --> 03:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
listened to the other divisions and I
 
03:10:51.540 --> 03:10:52.309 align:start position:0%
listened to the other divisions and I
thought

03:10:52.309 --> 03:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
thought
 
03:10:55.010 --> 03:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
my goodness
 
03:10:57.110 --> 03:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
no reductions
 
03:10:59.330 --> 03:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
in those divisions but when you come to
 
03:11:01.190 --> 03:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
division three
 
03:11:04.010 --> 03:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
where we serve the neediest people in
 
03:11:05.750 --> 03:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
our state
 
03:11:05.760 --> 03:11:07.130 align:start position:0%
our state
children

03:11:07.130 --> 03:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:11:09.170 --> 03:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
the elderly
 
03:11:12.070 --> 03:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
the lowest income people
 
03:11:16.190 --> 03:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
there's 50 million dollars back of the
 
03:11:18.590 --> 03:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
budget reduction
 
03:11:21.889 --> 03:11:21.899 align:start position:0%
as well as a 22 million dollar
 
03:11:24.170 --> 03:11:24.180 align:start position:0%
reduction in personnel
 
03:11:26.210 --> 03:11:26.220 align:start position:0%
cost at the Department of Health and
 
03:11:27.190 --> 03:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
Human Services
 
03:11:27.200 --> 03:11:28.610 align:start position:0%
Human Services
[Music]

03:11:28.610 --> 03:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:11:31.429 --> 03:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
all of those as many of you know
 
03:11:31.439 --> 03:11:32.870 align:start position:0%
all of those as many of you know
also

03:11:32.870 --> 03:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:11:34.730 --> 03:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
will cause there to be less federal
 
03:11:36.889 --> 03:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
dollars available
 
03:11:40.610 --> 03:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
it's 50 million dollars is General funds
 
03:11:43.370 --> 03:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
that stands to lose us probably close to
 
03:11:45.410 --> 03:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
another 50 million
 
03:11:47.750 --> 03:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
so from services to New Hampshire
 
03:11:47.760 --> 03:11:49.370 align:start position:0%
so from services to New Hampshire
citizens

03:11:49.370 --> 03:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
03:11:52.849 --> 03:11:52.859 align:start position:0%
we are reducing our budget by
 
03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
at least 100 million
 
03:11:59.150 --> 03:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
when you look at the 22 million dollars
 
03:12:04.849 --> 03:12:04.859 align:start position:0%
in positions which is 226 positions
 
03:12:06.889 --> 03:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
some of those positions will be Child
 
03:12:10.370 --> 03:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
Protection positions positions who work
 
03:12:13.670 --> 03:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
with the elderly positioned who may work
 
03:12:16.849 --> 03:12:16.859 align:start position:0%
in our Public Health Labs I mean there's
 
03:12:19.910 --> 03:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's such a vast array of services
 
03:12:23.269 --> 03:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
provided by that department and it it
 
03:12:25.370 --> 03:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
really bothered me
 
03:12:29.750 --> 03:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
that there were few if any reductions in
 
03:12:32.630 --> 03:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
the other divisions and division three
 
03:12:34.809 --> 03:12:34.819 align:start position:0%
ended up
 
03:12:37.849 --> 03:12:37.859 align:start position:0%
several many million dollars worth of
 
03:12:40.370 --> 03:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
reductions so for that reason I'm voting
 
03:12:44.330 --> 03:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
no on um House Bill one yeah
 
03:12:47.929 --> 03:12:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:51.490 --> 03:12:51.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:54.889 --> 03:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
Mr chair representative Edwards I I
 
03:12:58.250 --> 03:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
would just like to respond to that uh
 
03:13:01.969 --> 03:13:01.979 align:start position:0%
that from the previous budget to the
 
03:13:05.210 --> 03:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
current budget the budget was increased
 
03:13:07.610 --> 03:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
18 for the Department
 
03:13:10.490 --> 03:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
that's unsustainable
 
03:13:14.870 --> 03:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
um 18 is is is is more than the stake in
 
03:13:18.710 --> 03:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
sport and what we've done with the next
 
03:13:22.010 --> 03:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
budget is by the time you take a look at
 
03:13:24.650 --> 03:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
the previous budget the current budget
 
03:13:27.469 --> 03:13:27.479 align:start position:0%
and the next budget there's ongoing
 
03:13:30.550 --> 03:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
steady growth from year to year to year
 
03:13:33.769 --> 03:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
there's still plenty of headcount for
 
03:13:35.510 --> 03:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
the number of people who are available
 
03:13:39.230 --> 03:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
in a very tight job market to be added
 
03:13:42.469 --> 03:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
and to be hired but we're asking the
 
03:13:46.910 --> 03:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
department management to do is to grow
 
03:13:51.410 --> 03:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
but to grow at a reasonable planned and
 
03:13:53.030 --> 03:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
sustainable rate
 
03:13:57.290 --> 03:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
that the state can absorb and asking the
 
03:14:01.309 --> 03:14:01.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of the state to pay more
 
03:14:05.210 --> 03:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
coming out of a pandemic when we have so
 
03:14:07.730 --> 03:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
many businesses and homes needing to
 
03:14:10.849 --> 03:14:10.859 align:start position:0%
re-establish themselves I think it we
 
03:14:13.550 --> 03:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
just need to keep some perspective that
 
03:14:17.030 --> 03:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
the department is going to grow it's not
 
03:14:21.349 --> 03:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:24.290 --> 03:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
03:14:26.809 --> 03:14:26.819 align:start position:0%
a hand up Mr chairman
 
03:14:29.450 --> 03:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
I see both representative Ober and
 
03:14:30.950 --> 03:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative noidgren representative
 
03:14:30.960 --> 03:14:34.429 align:start position:0%
representative noidgren representative
Ober

03:14:34.429 --> 03:14:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:37.010 --> 03:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman with all due
 
03:14:39.410 --> 03:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
respect to the previous Finance chair
 
03:14:42.650 --> 03:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
and my colleague who just spoke
 
03:14:44.269 --> 03:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
she started by saying the other
 
03:14:47.929 --> 03:14:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:49.490 --> 03:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
if she had been listening this morning
 
03:14:52.190 --> 03:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
she would have heard that division every
 
03:14:53.750 --> 03:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
20 million dollars
 
03:14:58.070 --> 03:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
in addition we added on nearly 30
 
03:15:01.070 --> 03:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
million of dollars of spending that the
 
03:15:04.849 --> 03:15:04.859 align:start position:0%
other two divisions could benefit from
 
03:15:07.309 --> 03:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
I know that none of us want to cut our
 
03:15:10.849 --> 03:15:10.859 align:start position:0%
divisions every cut in my division hurt
 
03:15:13.429 --> 03:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
the division members didn't like them I
 
03:15:15.530 --> 03:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
didn't like them I feel fairly certain
 
03:15:18.110 --> 03:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
that that was the same with what
 
03:15:20.210 --> 03:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
happened in division three but we need
 
03:15:22.730 --> 03:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
to be on record other divisions did make
 
03:15:25.910 --> 03:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
cuts and other divisions also added
 
03:15:28.490 --> 03:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
Revenue above and beyond what we had and
 
03:15:30.889 --> 03:15:30.899 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman just a gentle reminder as
 
03:15:33.349 --> 03:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
you know at 2 30 I have to go to another
 
03:15:35.330 --> 03:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
meeting that was previously scheduled
 
03:15:37.730 --> 03:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
long before this was scheduled and thank
 
03:15:39.950 --> 03:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
you for letting me speak
 
03:15:42.610 --> 03:15:42.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representative noidgren
 
03:15:42.620 --> 03:15:44.510 align:start position:0%
thank you representative noidgren
[Music]

03:15:44.510 --> 03:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:15:46.670 --> 03:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:15:50.990 --> 03:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:53.929 --> 03:15:53.939 align:start position:0%
and I think I would again call it a
 
03:15:57.469 --> 03:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
question as representative walner noted
 
03:16:01.130 --> 03:16:01.140 align:start position:0%
the back of the budget cut of 30 million
 
03:16:03.290 --> 03:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
the first year and
 
03:16:06.650 --> 03:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
20 million the second year really
 
03:16:10.790 --> 03:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
make it clear that we have not done the
 
03:16:13.790 --> 03:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
work we should have done this is an easy
 
03:16:16.730 --> 03:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
thing to do I think it also our concern
 
03:16:18.950 --> 03:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
and I know representative Wallner
 
03:16:20.690 --> 03:16:20.700 align:start position:0%
representative Rogers shared this
 
03:16:24.769 --> 03:16:24.779 align:start position:0%
concern uh the department Labs millions
 
03:16:27.950 --> 03:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
of dollars last year and obviously with
 
03:16:30.410 --> 03:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and everything else going
 
03:16:32.150 --> 03:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
on there are probably some reasons for
 
03:16:36.889 --> 03:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
that but it's my concern that uh what
 
03:16:39.230 --> 03:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
our budget does
 
03:16:43.510 --> 03:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
needs to happen and I think the lapsing
 
03:16:47.450 --> 03:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
and the cuts that we leave up to the
 
03:16:50.809 --> 03:16:50.819 align:start position:0%
department uh we'll be putting a lot of
 
03:16:54.170 --> 03:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
people in agencies in Peril and I would
 
03:16:57.950 --> 03:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
also call attention to the questions I
 
03:17:01.309 --> 03:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
had on the Family Planning line of fifty
 
03:17:03.290 --> 03:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars I don't think we have
 
03:17:06.469 --> 03:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
enough definition of what that does and
 
03:17:08.870 --> 03:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
I will be voting against toast no one
 
03:17:12.410 --> 03:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:18.590 --> 03:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:20.630 --> 03:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
um I too will be going against this
 
03:17:23.210 --> 03:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
budget in large part because of what it
 
03:17:26.750 --> 03:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
takes away from family planning I have
 
03:17:31.450 --> 03:17:31.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:35.030 --> 03:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
change in funding in combination with
 
03:17:37.550 --> 03:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
house will tooth change in reality what
 
03:17:39.950 --> 03:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
will happen
 
03:17:42.889 --> 03:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
is the number of our health clinics will
 
03:17:46.130 --> 03:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
not be able to survive and a woman's
 
03:17:48.950 --> 03:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
right to choose is going to be severely
 
03:17:52.490 --> 03:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
limited in this state in the Years
 
03:17:54.590 --> 03:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we have a right to do
 
03:17:54.600 --> 03:17:55.809 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we have a right to do
that

03:17:55.809 --> 03:17:55.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:17:58.070 --> 03:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
and while
 
03:18:01.010 --> 03:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
friend will argue that oh he's not doing
 
03:18:03.230 --> 03:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
anything to affect that we all know that
 
03:18:06.290 --> 03:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
it is by having grants to have new
 
03:18:10.130 --> 03:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
clinics come forward and pick up the
 
03:18:13.190 --> 03:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
cuddle if you will or whatever they have
 
03:18:16.929 --> 03:18:16.939 align:start position:0%
this black could be taken out
 
03:18:21.530 --> 03:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
what to do whatever that's all but um
 
03:18:23.750 --> 03:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
people are not going to be allowed do we
 
03:18:25.490 --> 03:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
have enough work and when they need to
 
03:18:25.500 --> 03:18:26.570 align:start position:0%
have enough work and when they need to
if

03:18:26.570 --> 03:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:18:28.910 --> 03:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
and that's the first
 
03:18:30.889 --> 03:18:30.899 align:start position:0%
um I think we should have been more open
 
03:18:33.230 --> 03:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
about it and transparent I don't think
 
03:18:36.590 --> 03:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
it should have done the way it was done
 
03:18:38.330 --> 03:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
um policy the policy should have been
 
03:18:40.790 --> 03:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
argued in a policy committee who brought
 
03:18:43.370 --> 03:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
forward that way not done with a sleight
 
03:18:44.389 --> 03:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
of hand
 
03:18:46.309 --> 03:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
and but
 
03:18:48.769 --> 03:18:48.779 align:start position:0%
um that's not the way we do things we've
 
03:18:48.779 --> 03:18:49.849 align:start position:0%
um that's not the way we do things we've
been

03:18:49.849 --> 03:18:49.859 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:18:49.859 --> 03:18:53.970 align:start position:0%
been
um

03:18:53.970 --> 03:18:53.980 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:53.980 --> 03:18:57.190 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:18:57.190 --> 03:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:00.110 --> 03:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
knows that no state and no federal money
 
03:19:02.809 --> 03:19:02.819 align:start position:0%
go towards funding any abortion service
 
03:19:05.030 --> 03:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
what these clinics do with the money we
 
03:19:08.210 --> 03:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
give them is they do testing for STDs
 
03:19:10.429 --> 03:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
they do cancer screenings they do
 
03:19:12.950 --> 03:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
women's health care and for a number of
 
03:19:15.290 --> 03:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
very poor women in the state it's the
 
03:19:16.730 --> 03:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
only way they can afford to get that
 
03:19:18.410 --> 03:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
Healthcare they don't have insurance
 
03:19:20.990 --> 03:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
they can't pay for it that way and if
 
03:19:22.610 --> 03:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
these Clinic goes out of business
 
03:19:23.630 --> 03:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
um where are they going to go I think
 
03:19:25.790 --> 03:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
yes we'll find out
 
03:19:27.590 --> 03:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
so for that
 
03:19:30.650 --> 03:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
reason and others that has been been
 
03:19:32.690 --> 03:19:32.700 align:start position:0%
talked about by other members are on
 
03:19:34.849 --> 03:19:34.859 align:start position:0%
this table I can't vote for this budget
 
03:19:37.790 --> 03:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time
 
03:19:37.800 --> 03:19:40.670 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time
um

03:19:40.670 --> 03:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:43.150 --> 03:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I respond to that
 
03:19:45.769 --> 03:19:45.779 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
03:19:50.030 --> 03:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
so um to just describe the funding
 
03:19:52.630 --> 03:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
growth in the Family Planning line
 
03:19:59.469 --> 03:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
at the end of fy19 the state invested
 
03:20:03.530 --> 03:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
596 000 in Family Planning
 
03:20:06.110 --> 03:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
at the end of the first year of this
 
03:20:06.120 --> 03:20:07.130 align:start position:0%
at the end of the first year of this
budget

03:20:07.130 --> 03:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:20:09.530 --> 03:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
we've accepted the governor's budget
 
03:20:12.170 --> 03:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
request for Family Planning that's at
 
03:20:14.809 --> 03:20:14.819 align:start position:0%
eight hundred and twelve thousand so to
 
03:20:22.730 --> 03:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
go from 596 to 812 is more than a 10 per
 
03:20:26.269 --> 03:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
year increase in Family Planning there
 
03:20:29.750 --> 03:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
is absolutely no shortfall in the family
 
03:20:34.610 --> 03:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
planning in addition to that 812 we put
 
03:20:37.550 --> 03:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
an extra 50 000 in to stimulate
 
03:20:40.790 --> 03:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
additional competition to help ensure
 
03:20:44.450 --> 03:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
that there is no problem with access to
 
03:20:49.550 --> 03:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
care so so uh we we have
 
03:20:52.670 --> 03:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh there's a hospital too that still
 
03:20:55.610 --> 03:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
needs to be talked about but in terms of
 
03:20:58.370 --> 03:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
Family Planning Family Planning is going
 
03:21:00.530 --> 03:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
to do very very well under this budget
 
03:21:02.870 --> 03:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
we've protected it we've increased it
 
03:21:07.969 --> 03:21:07.979 align:start position:0%
more than 10 percent a year since FY 19.
 
03:21:10.730 --> 03:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
okay I see people keep coming back and
 
03:21:12.710 --> 03:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
coming back I'd like to cut this short
 
03:21:15.349 --> 03:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
because we Kevin a lot of repetition did
 
03:21:17.030 --> 03:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
you want to reply representative Rogers
 
03:21:18.170 --> 03:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
and you don't have that good a
 
03:21:19.969 --> 03:21:19.979 align:start position:0%
microphone I can't understand a lot of
 
03:21:25.490 --> 03:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:27.410 --> 03:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
so I apologize
 
03:21:29.269 --> 03:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say that people should
 
03:21:29.279 --> 03:21:29.929 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say that people should
um

03:21:29.929 --> 03:21:29.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:31.849 --> 03:21:31.859 align:start position:0%
should think very carefully about the
 
03:21:33.590 --> 03:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
words that are said here we all know
 
03:21:36.650 --> 03:21:36.660 align:start position:0%
that statistics and and budget numbers
 
03:21:39.230 --> 03:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
can be translated in many ways and I
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
would just tell people that they should
 
03:21:42.530 --> 03:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
really check the numbers because in
 
03:21:44.809 --> 03:21:44.819 align:start position:0%
reality the numbers that are being
 
03:21:47.389 --> 03:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
thrown about with Family Planning can be
 
03:21:49.250 --> 03:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
looked at a number of ways and I think
 
03:21:51.469 --> 03:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
that if we look at the general fund
 
03:21:54.290 --> 03:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
versus federal funds uh the makeup of
 
03:21:56.990 --> 03:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
the members and Family Planning are
 
03:21:58.849 --> 03:21:58.859 align:start position:0%
interpreted by many of us very different
 
03:22:01.190 --> 03:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
than representative Edwards interprets
 
03:22:04.250 --> 03:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
them and um I think that language is
 
03:22:06.230 --> 03:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
important so I would just ask people to
 
03:22:09.469 --> 03:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
look very carefully before they um make
 
03:22:11.690 --> 03:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
their assumptions thank you for letting
 
03:22:14.290 --> 03:22:14.300 align:start position:0%
me result please thank you
 
03:22:22.490 --> 03:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:25.070 --> 03:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
no thank you
 
03:22:27.590 --> 03:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman because additional
 
03:22:29.510 --> 03:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
numbers were brought up I think I just
 
03:22:32.809 --> 03:22:32.819 align:start position:0%
need to address those as well
 
03:22:35.510 --> 03:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards all right thank
 
03:22:38.349 --> 03:22:38.359 align:start position:0%
you sir so to keep in
 
03:22:41.269 --> 03:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
context the eight hundred and twelve
 
03:22:44.210 --> 03:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in Family Planning
 
03:22:47.090 --> 03:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
money that we're investing
 
03:22:49.429 --> 03:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
um it should be compared a lot of people
 
03:22:52.790 --> 03:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
are concerned about uh whether or not
 
03:22:55.429 --> 03:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
uh Planned Parenthood of Northern New
 
03:22:57.490 --> 03:22:57.500 align:start position:0%
England is going to be able to continue
 
03:23:01.130 --> 03:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
to to compete for Family Planning
 
03:23:05.830 --> 03:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
dollars and in the last year
 
03:23:09.170 --> 03:23:09.180 align:start position:0%
uh Planned Parenthood received probably
 
03:23:13.070 --> 03:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
about 350 K of the Family Planning money
 
03:23:16.190 --> 03:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
well what is 350k
 
03:23:19.309 --> 03:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
last year Planned Parenthood spent six
 
03:23:21.769 --> 03:23:21.779 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars on lobbying
 
03:23:24.769 --> 03:23:24.779 align:start position:0%
last year Planned Parenthood spent two
 
03:23:27.190 --> 03:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
million dollars on marketing
 
03:23:31.729 --> 03:23:31.739 align:start position:0%
uh last year 32 percent of planned
 
03:23:35.330 --> 03:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
parenthood's money came from Medicaid
 
03:23:38.570 --> 03:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
uh in the coming year it's projected
 
03:23:40.969 --> 03:23:40.979 align:start position:0%
that the federal government will write a
 
03:23:42.769 --> 03:23:42.779 align:start position:0%
direct appropriation to Planned
 
03:23:45.110 --> 03:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
Parenthood the tune of eight hundred
 
03:23:46.969 --> 03:23:46.979 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year
 
03:23:46.979 --> 03:23:48.469 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year
so

03:23:48.469 --> 03:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:23:53.330 --> 03:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
this little tiny dollop of State monies
 
03:23:55.510 --> 03:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
for Family Planning
 
03:23:58.490 --> 03:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
will be used to help Family Planning
 
03:24:01.370 --> 03:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
counseling and to provide services and I
 
03:24:03.229 --> 03:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
don't think anyone needs to worry about
 
03:24:05.229 --> 03:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
the financial
 
03:24:09.110 --> 03:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
wherewithal of Planned Parenthood
 
03:24:16.030 --> 03:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:19.550 --> 03:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
my hand is enough and I have no comment
 
03:24:21.170 --> 03:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:24:21.180 --> 03:24:23.030 align:start position:0%

24. uh this deals with the
 
03:26:31.370 --> 03:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
this deals with the county cap issue
 
03:26:33.889 --> 03:26:33.899 align:start position:0%
that I discussed earlier because it had
 
03:26:37.070 --> 03:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
such a significant hp1 effect but this
 
03:26:41.269 --> 03:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
is the amendment necessary to execute
 
03:26:41.279 --> 03:26:42.469 align:start position:0%
is the amendment necessary to execute
the

03:26:42.469 --> 03:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:26:46.010 --> 03:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
um the uh anticipation of the increased
 
03:26:50.210 --> 03:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
uh fmap funding uh trying to hold
 
03:26:52.370 --> 03:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
current and Future
 
03:26:54.710 --> 03:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
rates of increase for the counties at
 
03:26:56.450 --> 03:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
two percent
 
03:27:00.290 --> 03:27:00.300 align:start position:0%
um it also shows the dollar amounts that
 
03:27:02.330 --> 03:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
we would appropriate from General funds
 
03:27:05.929 --> 03:27:05.939 align:start position:0%
to the counties to help cover County
 
03:27:07.929 --> 03:27:07.939 align:start position:0%
Nursing Home expenses
 
03:27:11.929 --> 03:27:11.939 align:start position:0%
the next item uh the prospective repeal
 
03:27:13.790 --> 03:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
regarding eligibility of services
 
03:27:24.870 --> 03:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:24.880 --> 03:27:30.170 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:27:30.170 --> 03:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:36.410 --> 03:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
so we repealed section 25 because the
 
03:27:40.610 --> 03:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
purpose of of of uh of section 25 had
 
03:27:45.170 --> 03:27:45.180 align:start position:0%
been a recurring kicking of a of a
 
03:27:49.190 --> 03:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
of an amendment uh year after year it
 
03:27:51.469 --> 03:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
had been in there for 10 years and now
 
03:27:53.990 --> 03:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
because a statute is going into effect
 
03:27:56.330 --> 03:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
it was no longer needed so we just
 
03:27:59.690 --> 03:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
simply deleted section 25.
 
03:28:04.429 --> 03:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
the next one on the repeal of of a
 
03:28:06.590 --> 03:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
current exemption
 
03:28:09.650 --> 03:28:09.660 align:start position:0%
um the the this was proposed by the
 
03:28:12.050 --> 03:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
governor the only thing that we did to
 
03:28:14.809 --> 03:28:14.819 align:start position:0%
this as an amendment the governor wanted
 
03:28:17.809 --> 03:28:17.819 align:start position:0%
the repeal authority to or the exemption
 
03:28:21.650 --> 03:28:21.660 align:start position:0%
Authority rather to to end January 1 of
 
03:28:26.210 --> 03:28:26.220 align:start position:0%
23 the department wanted June of 23 on a
 
03:28:28.849 --> 03:28:28.859 align:start position:0%
six to one vote we voted to support the
 
03:28:31.550 --> 03:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
Department's request to extend it to
 
03:28:34.849 --> 03:28:34.859 align:start position:0%
June of 23. but that was a
 
03:28:34.859 --> 03:28:36.309 align:start position:0%
June of 23. but that was a
non-controversial

03:28:36.309 --> 03:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
non-controversial
 
03:28:38.450 --> 03:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
Amendment otherwise
 
03:28:42.969 --> 03:28:42.979 align:start position:0%
uh the next one uh section 33
 
03:28:46.790 --> 03:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
was a correction
 
03:28:48.849 --> 03:28:48.859 align:start position:0%
that was submitted
 
03:28:52.309 --> 03:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
to pick up an extra hundred thousand
 
03:28:55.490 --> 03:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
dollars that was available that we just
 
03:28:57.650 --> 03:28:57.660 align:start position:0%
hadn't accounted for
 
03:28:57.660 --> 03:28:58.809 align:start position:0%
hadn't accounted for
section

03:28:58.809 --> 03:28:58.819 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:29:02.929 --> 03:29:02.939 align:start position:0%
34. this is the amendment uh to the
 
03:29:06.229 --> 03:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Facilities Line This
 
03:29:09.349 --> 03:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
is the the one area that that I'm sure
 
03:29:11.750 --> 03:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
has stimulated the most contention in
 
03:29:16.250 --> 03:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
division three it essentially says that
 
03:29:16.260 --> 03:29:16.849 align:start position:0%
division three it essentially says that
um

03:29:16.849 --> 03:29:16.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:19.150 --> 03:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
Family Planning money
 
03:29:22.870 --> 03:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
should be given to
 
03:29:25.910 --> 03:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
those services that are providing the
 
03:29:28.929 --> 03:29:28.939 align:start position:0%
full range of Family Medical planning
 
03:29:33.910 --> 03:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
but uh but don't also have
 
03:29:36.190 --> 03:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
reproductive health facility services
 
03:29:39.530 --> 03:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
under the same roof if you go to the RSA
 
03:29:41.809 --> 03:29:41.819 align:start position:0%
and you look at reproductive health
 
03:29:44.809 --> 03:29:44.819 align:start position:0%
facilities in general but not exactly
 
03:29:47.210 --> 03:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
but in general a reproductive health
 
03:29:50.990 --> 03:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
facility is an outpatient abortion
 
03:29:54.050 --> 03:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
clinic so so when people laymen are
 
03:29:56.510 --> 03:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
looking at this they can think of it as
 
03:29:58.370 --> 03:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
just saying we're looking for physical
 
03:30:01.990 --> 03:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
and financial separation between
 
03:30:04.670 --> 03:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
clients coming in for Family Planning
 
03:30:08.450 --> 03:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
services and having abortions provided
 
03:30:10.570 --> 03:30:10.580 align:start position:0%
under the same roof
 
03:30:13.450 --> 03:30:13.460 align:start position:0%
this does not affect
 
03:30:17.030 --> 03:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
in any way the counseling that a woman
 
03:30:20.870 --> 03:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
can get because the full range of
 
03:30:23.170 --> 03:30:23.180 align:start position:0%
counseling will be available
 
03:30:26.330 --> 03:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
abortion is a constitutionally protected
 
03:30:29.870 --> 03:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
medical service in this country and we
 
03:30:32.150 --> 03:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
would never I hope we would never
 
03:30:35.170 --> 03:30:35.180 align:start position:0%
consider Banning a woman from being told
 
03:30:38.510 --> 03:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
about all of her options
 
03:30:41.269 --> 03:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh regardless of how we may believe of
 
03:30:43.550 --> 03:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
them they are constitutionally protected
 
03:30:43.560 --> 03:30:45.110 align:start position:0%
them they are constitutionally protected
so

03:30:45.110 --> 03:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:30:47.530 --> 03:30:47.540 align:start position:0%
um section 35
 
03:30:52.130 --> 03:30:52.140 align:start position:0%
was a partial acceptance of an Alvarez
 
03:30:55.969 --> 03:30:55.979 align:start position:0%
and Martinez outside Consulting study we
 
03:30:58.309 --> 03:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
got this report very late in our process
 
03:31:00.229 --> 03:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
very late
 
03:31:02.570 --> 03:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
um uh two weeks later than it was
 
03:31:05.090 --> 03:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
available to the department and there
 
03:31:07.790 --> 03:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
were four recommendations that we picked
 
03:31:12.469 --> 03:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
up that spent some money about 3.3
 
03:31:14.929 --> 03:31:14.939 align:start position:0%
million dollars but the payoff period
 
03:31:18.229 --> 03:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
was excellent we got about 10.6 million
 
03:31:21.530 --> 03:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
from that 3.3 million investment within
 
03:31:22.630 --> 03:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
the first
 
03:31:25.729 --> 03:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
biennium so that just was a no-brainer
 
03:31:28.910 --> 03:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh we we we accepted that section with
 
03:31:30.530 --> 03:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
03:31:33.590 --> 03:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
then section 37
 
03:31:36.410 --> 03:31:36.420 align:start position:0%
was a proposal in the governor's budget
 
03:31:41.929 --> 03:31:41.939 align:start position:0%
to invest 1.5 million at senior citizen
 
03:31:45.849 --> 03:31:45.859 align:start position:0%
centers to help them purchase
 
03:31:48.950 --> 03:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
barriers and other infrastructure to
 
03:31:52.790 --> 03:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
help with the covid protection and the
 
03:31:55.550 --> 03:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
issue we had with this one the reason
 
03:31:57.490 --> 03:31:57.500 align:start position:0%
that we deleted it
 
03:32:00.530 --> 03:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
was although we supported the concept
 
03:32:04.250 --> 03:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
and the need entirely there's about 800
 
03:32:06.590 --> 03:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
different organizations in the state
 
03:32:09.530 --> 03:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
that would qualify as a Senior Citizen
 
03:32:12.410 --> 03:32:12.420 align:start position:0%
Center so and there was nothing in the
 
03:32:14.809 --> 03:32:14.819 align:start position:0%
section that dealt with who was eligible
 
03:32:17.150 --> 03:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
who was not and how the bids would go
 
03:32:19.910 --> 03:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
and with a little tiny amount of 1.5
 
03:32:22.610 --> 03:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
million it would have been smarter for
 
03:32:24.950 --> 03:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
the state to just write two thousand
 
03:32:27.889 --> 03:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
dollars checks to each Senior Citizen
 
03:32:30.290 --> 03:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
Center but the department can't do that
 
03:32:32.269 --> 03:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
they can only give money to somebody
 
03:32:33.950 --> 03:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
that they have a legit government
 
03:32:36.710 --> 03:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
contract with so because the overhead
 
03:32:39.410 --> 03:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
expenses were take up such a huge
 
03:32:41.990 --> 03:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
portion of the 1.5 we just simply
 
03:32:44.269 --> 03:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
deleted it
 
03:32:44.279 --> 03:32:45.769 align:start position:0%
deleted it
um

03:32:45.769 --> 03:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:49.969 --> 03:32:49.979 align:start position:0%
uh number 38 we discussed earlier this
 
03:32:49.979 --> 03:32:51.349 align:start position:0%
uh number 38 we discussed earlier this
was

03:32:51.349 --> 03:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:32:51.359 --> 03:32:52.550 align:start position:0%
was
um

03:32:52.550 --> 03:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:54.229 --> 03:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh two hundred thousand dollars
 
03:32:59.750 --> 03:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
initially that was in hb2 for an ongoing
 
03:33:02.870 --> 03:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
operation an ongoing expense so we moved
 
03:33:07.070 --> 03:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
it out of hb2 into hb1 and when we moved
 
03:33:10.250 --> 03:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
it we discovered six hundred thousand
 
03:33:13.070 --> 03:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
dollars of federal funds that are is
 
03:33:16.130 --> 03:33:16.140 align:start position:0%
attached to it so that's 600 000 also
 
03:33:18.710 --> 03:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
got added back to the budget from the
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
federal line uh when we moved the 200
 
03:33:25.010 --> 03:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
000 in hb1
 
03:33:29.510 --> 03:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
um item 39 I would say would be one of
 
03:33:31.910 --> 03:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
the two greatest areas of agreement that
 
03:33:33.349 --> 03:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
we had
 
03:33:38.510 --> 03:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
um a uh section 39 was a proposal in the
 
03:33:41.030 --> 03:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
governor's budget to go ahead and build
 
03:33:45.110 --> 03:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
a new forensic Mental Health Hospital on
 
03:33:47.870 --> 03:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
the grounds of near the New Hampshire
 
03:33:54.729 --> 03:33:54.739 align:start position:0%
hospital and uh it had language in there
 
03:33:57.710 --> 03:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
essentially taking General funds and and
 
03:34:01.250 --> 03:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
in lieu of capital funds uh it went from
 
03:34:04.670 --> 03:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
a 25 bed facility which was uh approved
 
03:34:07.309 --> 03:34:07.319 align:start position:0%
in the previous biennium to 60 beds with
 
03:34:10.309 --> 03:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
really no explanation of the difference
 
03:34:13.250 --> 03:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
between the two so so what we did here
 
03:34:17.389 --> 03:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
was we deleted section 39
 
03:34:19.130 --> 03:34:19.140 align:start position:0%
um from the version we're going to send
 
03:34:22.070 --> 03:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
over the Senate and the division three
 
03:34:24.469 --> 03:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
is going to have a joint hearing with
 
03:34:29.389 --> 03:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
public works and with HHS on April 12th
 
03:34:32.750 --> 03:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
so that we can dig deeper into this
 
03:34:32.760 --> 03:34:33.950 align:start position:0%
so that we can dig deeper into this
issue

03:34:33.950 --> 03:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:34:38.030 --> 03:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
and then from there we intend to provide
 
03:34:39.769 --> 03:34:39.779 align:start position:0%
notes over to the senate for their
 
03:34:42.229 --> 03:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
consideration we just didn't have time
 
03:34:44.389 --> 03:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
to hear everything that needed to be
 
03:34:45.650 --> 03:34:45.660 align:start position:0%
heard on that
 
03:34:49.429 --> 03:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
and then the the last one
 
03:34:52.190 --> 03:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
um those okay those were all the changes
 
03:34:52.200 --> 03:34:53.450 align:start position:0%
um those okay those were all the changes
to

03:34:53.450 --> 03:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:34:53.460 --> 03:34:54.229 align:start position:0%
to
um

03:34:54.229 --> 03:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:58.849 --> 03:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
to to HP to the sections that we we
 
03:35:01.849 --> 03:35:01.859 align:start position:0%
inherited then we started a bunch of new
 
03:35:05.210 --> 03:35:05.220 align:start position:0%
ones that are really the um the first
 
03:35:07.969 --> 03:35:07.979 align:start position:0%
one is around the Medicaid management
 
03:35:10.550 --> 03:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
information system we moved that from
 
03:35:13.070 --> 03:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
hb1 over to hb2 I've talked about that
 
03:35:16.450 --> 03:35:16.460 align:start position:0%
so this is a new line item amendment
 
03:35:20.450 --> 03:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:22.610 --> 03:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
um we
 
03:35:26.630 --> 03:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:29.090 --> 03:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
I'm having trouble remembering the child
 
03:35:34.090 --> 03:35:34.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:37.849 --> 03:35:37.859 align:start position:0%
I think we added funds it's my memory
 
03:35:40.550 --> 03:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
but I should double check
 
03:35:40.560 --> 03:35:43.969 align:start position:0%
but I should double check
s

03:35:43.969 --> 03:35:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:43.979 --> 03:35:47.809 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:35:47.809 --> 03:35:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:47.819 --> 03:35:51.889 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:35:51.889 --> 03:35:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:51.899 --> 03:35:53.330 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:35:53.330 --> 03:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:35:57.110 --> 03:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment was an authorization to
 
03:36:00.110 --> 03:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
use TANF money which is federal money
 
03:36:02.809 --> 03:36:02.819 align:start position:0%
that may be available if the
 
03:36:06.590 --> 03:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner were to determine that we
 
03:36:11.030 --> 03:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
have a employment related wait list for
 
03:36:15.349 --> 03:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
child care services and so so this was
 
03:36:17.870 --> 03:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
us trying to help solve a weightless
 
03:36:20.990 --> 03:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
problem for child care services related
 
03:36:23.990 --> 03:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
to employment and to use federal funds
 
03:36:26.150 --> 03:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
to help make up the shortfall
 
03:36:26.160 --> 03:36:27.590 align:start position:0%
to help make up the shortfall
so

03:36:27.590 --> 03:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:36:31.490 --> 03:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
um the next one uh relative to state of
 
03:36:34.130 --> 03:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
emergency declaration this is one that
 
03:36:37.010 --> 03:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
we had some controversy in the in the
 
03:36:37.020 --> 03:36:38.450 align:start position:0%
we had some controversy in the in the
committee

03:36:38.450 --> 03:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:36:41.690 --> 03:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
um and and what this basically does is
 
03:36:45.410 --> 03:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
it allows the governor to declare a
 
03:36:47.750 --> 03:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
state of emergency
 
03:36:50.469 --> 03:36:50.479 align:start position:0%
um and to begin
 
03:36:53.570 --> 03:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
meeting his executive obligations under
 
03:36:57.410 --> 03:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency but it calls in a
 
03:37:01.429 --> 03:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
need to get the legislature involved in
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
extending the state of emergency beyond
 
03:37:07.130 --> 03:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
the first 21 days and so if the
 
03:37:10.370 --> 03:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
legislature is deemed to be able to meet
 
03:37:13.969 --> 03:37:13.979 align:start position:0%
with a quorum then the legislature needs
 
03:37:16.550 --> 03:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
to meet in order to extend the state of
 
03:37:19.250 --> 03:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
emergency but if we cannot get a quorum
 
03:37:22.429 --> 03:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
from the legislature then the governor
 
03:37:25.250 --> 03:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
can continue to extend on 21 day
 
03:37:28.610 --> 03:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
increments so that's that's an end of
 
03:37:30.790 --> 03:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
that that would bring the legislature
 
03:37:36.410 --> 03:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
back into being a co-equal branch with
 
03:37:40.570 --> 03:37:40.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:44.090 --> 03:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
from there down there's a series of
 
03:37:47.510 --> 03:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
amendments related to closure of the
 
03:37:50.150 --> 03:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
sununu center you know transferring
 
03:37:53.450 --> 03:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
property making sure that people are
 
03:37:55.910 --> 03:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
retained everyone who has a job at the
 
03:38:00.110 --> 03:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
sununu center uh will is expected to be
 
03:38:02.269 --> 03:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
canceled and helped with the retraining
 
03:38:05.030 --> 03:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
and re-classification process so that
 
03:38:06.769 --> 03:38:06.779 align:start position:0%
they can continue
 
03:38:09.889 --> 03:38:09.899 align:start position:0%
as state employees and then it transfers
 
03:38:12.469 --> 03:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
the property over to administrative
 
03:38:16.210 --> 03:38:16.220 align:start position:0%
services without prejudice meaning
 
03:38:18.769 --> 03:38:18.779 align:start position:0%
there's different opinions on how that
 
03:38:21.950 --> 03:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
land could be repurposed but but our
 
03:38:26.269 --> 03:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
committee was silent on what we intend
 
03:38:28.790 --> 03:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
the land to be used for
 
03:38:31.790 --> 03:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
and with that sir I'll take any
 
03:38:35.929 --> 03:38:35.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:37.910 --> 03:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative nordgren for a
 
03:38:37.920 --> 03:38:42.610 align:start position:0%
okay representative nordgren for a
question

03:38:42.610 --> 03:38:42.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:47.330 --> 03:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
no my hand is adopt sorry
 
03:38:49.570 --> 03:38:49.580 align:start position:0%
okay no question no
 
03:38:52.790 --> 03:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
represent leishman for a question
 
03:38:55.849 --> 03:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so if we could go
 
03:38:58.150 --> 03:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
back to section
 
03:39:01.070 --> 03:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
34 commission for the chair
 
03:39:04.130 --> 03:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
of division three so I appreciate you
 
03:39:06.849 --> 03:39:06.859 align:start position:0%
saying that a woman's right to choose is
 
03:39:09.530 --> 03:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected but as I read
 
03:39:10.849 --> 03:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
03:39:13.309 --> 03:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
it would appear to be that it just makes
 
03:39:16.190 --> 03:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
it a lot more difficult for that
 
03:39:17.809 --> 03:39:17.819 align:start position:0%
woman to
 
03:39:25.210 --> 03:39:25.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:25.220 --> 03:39:26.929 align:start position:0%
 
is

03:39:26.929 --> 03:39:26.939 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:39:30.830 --> 03:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
so as it stands now the majority of the
 
03:39:32.929 --> 03:39:32.939 align:start position:0%
Family Planning clinics
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
that receives State money do not provide
 
03:39:38.510 --> 03:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
abortion services
 
03:39:40.670 --> 03:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if many people know that
 
03:39:44.210 --> 03:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
but the majority do not and so
 
03:39:48.410 --> 03:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
um this is not a Prohibition on the
 
03:39:52.330 --> 03:39:52.340 align:start position:0%
client the woman receiving counseling
 
03:39:56.469 --> 03:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
on abortion services to include
 
03:39:59.210 --> 03:39:59.220 align:start position:0%
locations to include help with the
 
03:39:59.220 --> 03:40:00.469 align:start position:0%
locations to include help with the
referral

03:40:00.469 --> 03:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
referral
 
03:40:04.090 --> 03:40:04.100 align:start position:0%
to to include the whole
 
03:40:10.190 --> 03:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
mail you of options that she has
 
03:40:13.070 --> 03:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
all it does is it says that when she's
 
03:40:16.070 --> 03:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
walking down the hallway to the Family
 
03:40:19.809 --> 03:40:19.819 align:start position:0%
Planning counselor she's not walking by
 
03:40:22.429 --> 03:40:22.439 align:start position:0%
abortion procedure rooms
 
03:40:24.650 --> 03:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
there there will be a physical and
 
03:40:27.469 --> 03:40:27.479 align:start position:0%
financial separation between the
 
03:40:30.910 --> 03:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
counseling and the abortion provision
 
03:40:35.389 --> 03:40:35.399 align:start position:0%
abortion uh in in that setting is is
 
03:40:38.229 --> 03:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
very much like a self-referral
 
03:40:43.190 --> 03:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
federal law has for decades recognized
 
03:40:46.510 --> 03:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
the anti-kickback issues around
 
03:40:50.510 --> 03:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh Physicians and other providers being
 
03:40:54.130 --> 03:40:54.140 align:start position:0%
able to refer to their own own services
 
03:40:59.090 --> 03:40:59.100 align:start position:0%
and have forced providers to to be at
 
03:41:02.590 --> 03:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
arm's length when there's a perception
 
03:41:05.210 --> 03:41:05.220 align:start position:0%
that there could be a financial
 
03:41:09.110 --> 03:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
inducement to weigh on one type of
 
03:41:14.630 --> 03:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
referral or over another so so this is
 
03:41:19.010 --> 03:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
um a a rule that has been taken through
 
03:41:22.309 --> 03:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
courts and has been validated as
 
03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
something that the state can can
 
03:41:24.720 --> 03:41:29.349 align:start position:0%
something that the state can can
establish

03:41:29.349 --> 03:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:31.309 --> 03:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren did you have
 
03:41:33.050 --> 03:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
03:41:38.389 --> 03:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:41.570 --> 03:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
upset with the characterization of
 
03:41:44.389 --> 03:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
Representative Edwards in what the
 
03:41:48.229 --> 03:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
Family Planning organizations do and
 
03:41:50.690 --> 03:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
that they would make Kickback money I
 
03:41:53.870 --> 03:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
mean that just totally wrong and
 
03:41:56.570 --> 03:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
misstated and I can't believe people
 
03:41:59.269 --> 03:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
believe that but I also wanted to
 
03:42:05.150 --> 03:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
comment on the emergency order uh issue
 
03:42:09.410 --> 03:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
um I think uh that's something that
 
03:42:12.950 --> 03:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
obviously the chair of Finance told us
 
03:42:17.330 --> 03:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
was because he needed votes and
 
03:42:21.050 --> 03:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
um this was inserted at the last minute
 
03:42:24.349 --> 03:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
so that's a frustration
 
03:42:26.929 --> 03:42:26.939 align:start position:0%
um but I would also
 
03:42:26.939 --> 03:42:27.830 align:start position:0%
um but I would also
um

03:42:27.830 --> 03:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:31.250 --> 03:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
thank representative Weiler and
 
03:42:34.969 --> 03:42:34.979 align:start position:0%

great collaboration in in putting
 
03:42:42.370 --> 03:42:42.380 align:start position:0%
together all the Amendments we needed to
 
03:42:46.790 --> 03:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
move forward with the sununu center
 
03:42:48.710 --> 03:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's something we did
 
03:42:51.590 --> 03:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
as a group and that was well done thank
 
03:42:51.600 --> 03:42:52.910 align:start position:0%

03:42:58.439 --> 03:42:59.269 align:start position:0%
representative Porter for comment or a
question

03:42:59.269 --> 03:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
question

thank you Mr chair and I I would like to
 
03:43:04.490 --> 03:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
ask representative Edwards
 
03:43:06.590 --> 03:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
um many of the abortions that are
 
03:43:08.269 --> 03:43:08.279 align:start position:0%
performed what's called medical
 
03:43:11.330 --> 03:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
abortions which a doctor prescribes a
 
03:43:15.110 --> 03:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
pill that the patient takes at home
 
03:43:15.120 --> 03:43:16.210 align:start position:0%
pill that the patient takes at home
um

03:43:16.210 --> 03:43:16.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:18.969 --> 03:43:18.979 align:start position:0%
how will that
 
03:43:22.790 --> 03:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
will the Family Planning clinics need to
 
03:43:25.910 --> 03:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
have a special building and me and staff
 
03:43:28.550 --> 03:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
it so that people can go in and talk to
 
03:43:31.130 --> 03:43:31.140 align:start position:0%
their doctor and get a prescription
 
03:43:35.809 --> 03:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:38.150 --> 03:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm missing some of the words and
 
03:43:40.429 --> 03:43:40.439 align:start position:0%
what you're saying and I'm I'm I'm I'm
 
03:43:43.130 --> 03:43:43.140 align:start position:0%
concerned that they're critical words in
 
03:43:45.950 --> 03:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
your question I want me to ask it again
 
03:43:45.960 --> 03:43:47.389 align:start position:0%
your question I want me to ask it again
representative

03:43:47.389 --> 03:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:43:50.090 --> 03:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
yes please because for some reason the
 
03:43:52.429 --> 03:43:52.439 align:start position:0%
there's a muffle in in a few of those
 
03:43:52.439 --> 03:43:54.050 align:start position:0%
there's a muffle in in a few of those
words

03:43:54.050 --> 03:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
words
 
03:43:57.469 --> 03:43:57.479 align:start position:0%
let me check my uh volume is that better
 
03:44:00.469 --> 03:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
I I hope so let's let's try it again so
 
03:44:02.510 --> 03:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
my question is that many abortions that
 
03:44:04.550 --> 03:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
have performed are what is called
 
03:44:07.130 --> 03:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
medical abortions where a doctor a
 
03:44:09.349 --> 03:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
physician prescribes a pill that a
 
03:44:12.650 --> 03:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
patient takes at home right um
 
03:44:16.990 --> 03:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
under the provisions of this amendment
 
03:44:19.309 --> 03:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
would a
 
03:44:21.769 --> 03:44:21.779 align:start position:0%
a family planning Clinic have to have a
 
03:44:23.929 --> 03:44:23.939 align:start position:0%
separate building and staff a separate
 
03:44:26.389 --> 03:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
building to give prescriptions to their
 
03:44:29.929 --> 03:44:29.939 align:start position:0%
patients for a medical abortion
 
03:44:33.050 --> 03:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
hmm that's a really great question it's
 
03:44:34.870 --> 03:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
the first time I've heard the question
 
03:44:38.870 --> 03:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh in hundreds of emails and many hours
 
03:44:40.849 --> 03:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
of testimony that's the first time I've
 
03:44:43.670 --> 03:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
heard that question and I'll just State
 
03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh frankly that I I don't know
 
03:44:49.550 --> 03:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
03:44:52.969 --> 03:44:52.979 align:start position:0%
the the the term reproductive health
 
03:44:58.510 --> 03:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
facility is defined in RSA 130 colon 37
 
03:45:02.150 --> 03:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
I would need to go back over to that to
 
03:45:05.450 --> 03:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
to figure out whether or not the ability
 
03:45:07.389 --> 03:45:07.399 align:start position:0%
to prescribe
 
03:45:09.830 --> 03:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
that that
 
03:45:13.130 --> 03:45:13.140 align:start position:0%
but after oh he wants the right word uh
 
03:45:16.210 --> 03:45:16.220 align:start position:0%
the ability to prescribe that particular
 
03:45:19.969 --> 03:45:19.979 align:start position:0%
pill to terminate a pregnancy I don't
 
03:45:23.030 --> 03:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
know if that's defined currently as an
 
03:45:26.150 --> 03:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
abortion or as a contraceptive and I
 
03:45:28.070 --> 03:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
know that there's been court cases on
 
03:45:30.889 --> 03:45:30.899 align:start position:0%
both sides of that and I I just I just
 
03:45:32.570 --> 03:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
can't tell you that I know the answer
 
03:45:35.389 --> 03:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:39.490 --> 03:45:39.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:48.530 --> 03:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:50.349 --> 03:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
no I don't
 
03:45:54.110 --> 03:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:56.870 --> 03:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
say no further questions
 
03:45:59.389 --> 03:45:59.399 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards moves and
 
03:46:01.790 --> 03:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
representative Earth seconds that
 
03:46:05.990 --> 03:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
division threes changes to hb2 be
 
03:46:09.830 --> 03:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
accepted by the finance committee
 
03:46:11.870 --> 03:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
clerical column is there any further
 
03:46:15.610 --> 03:46:15.620 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Wallner
 
03:46:18.590 --> 03:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:46:20.750 --> 03:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
um I am going to vote against Hospital
 
03:46:24.290 --> 03:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
too but before I do I just want to say
 
03:46:27.229 --> 03:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
thank you to um all the members of our
 
03:46:30.530 --> 03:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
division I think everyone here today and
 
03:46:30.540 --> 03:46:32.870 align:start position:0%
division I think everyone here today and
watching

03:46:32.870 --> 03:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
watching
 
03:46:35.809 --> 03:46:35.819 align:start position:0%
out there in Zoom land
 
03:46:38.210 --> 03:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
um we can tell
 
03:46:40.670 --> 03:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
how difficult the work of division three
 
03:46:40.680 --> 03:46:41.690 align:start position:0%
how difficult the work of division three
is

03:46:41.690 --> 03:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:46:43.550 --> 03:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
so I just want to thank all of the
 
03:46:46.550 --> 03:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
members of the division for the hard
 
03:46:49.670 --> 03:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
work that we've done the LBA staff has
 
03:46:51.590 --> 03:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
been incredible they've been there with
 
03:46:54.710 --> 03:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
us through the whole thing and they
 
03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
deserve a lot of a lot of praise and a
 
03:47:00.349 --> 03:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
lot of thanks
 
03:47:02.030 --> 03:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think we could have done this
 
03:47:03.469 --> 03:47:03.479 align:start position:0%
without Zoom
 
03:47:05.389 --> 03:47:05.399 align:start position:0%
at the beginning I never would have
 
03:47:06.950 --> 03:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
thought we could have gotten through it
 
03:47:09.349 --> 03:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
but we did and
 
03:47:11.809 --> 03:47:11.819 align:start position:0%
um thank goodness for technology it
 
03:47:13.729 --> 03:47:13.739 align:start position:0%
actually ended up working pretty well
 
03:47:15.769 --> 03:47:15.779 align:start position:0%
most of the time
 
03:47:18.229 --> 03:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to say a special thanks to
 
03:47:20.990 --> 03:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
the people at the Department of Health
 
03:47:22.790 --> 03:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
and Human Services who were there with
 
03:47:22.800 --> 03:47:23.690 align:start position:0%
and Human Services who were there with
us

03:47:23.690 --> 03:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:47:26.269 --> 03:47:26.279 align:start position:0%
throughout these sessions they've been
 
03:47:28.910 --> 03:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
there every day Karen rounds and her
 
03:47:30.830 --> 03:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
team they were incredible they were
 
03:47:33.710 --> 03:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
really helpful and I really appreciate
 
03:47:36.290 --> 03:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
all the all the help they gave our
 
03:47:36.300 --> 03:47:38.330 align:start position:0%
all the all the help they gave our
division

03:47:38.330 --> 03:47:38.340 align:start position:0%
division
 
03:47:40.370 --> 03:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
03:47:40.380 --> 03:47:43.670 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
Rogers

03:47:43.670 --> 03:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:45.650 --> 03:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I hope that my
 
03:47:47.870 --> 03:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
sound is a little better now
 
03:47:50.570 --> 03:47:50.580 align:start position:0%
um I want to say that I again have to
 
03:47:52.490 --> 03:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
vote against House Bill 2 for a similar
 
03:47:55.309 --> 03:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
reason I think that it was clear
 
03:47:56.570 --> 03:47:56.580 align:start position:0%
um when we talked about House Bill one
 
03:47:59.750 --> 03:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
that certain Representatives want to use
 
03:48:02.269 --> 03:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
this budget to defund
 
03:48:04.550 --> 03:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
um certain places such as planned
 
03:48:04.560 --> 03:48:06.110 align:start position:0%
um certain places such as planned
parenthood

03:48:06.110 --> 03:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
parenthood
 
03:48:08.630 --> 03:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
um and the amendment to this which
 
03:48:12.170 --> 03:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
requires a separate facility
 
03:48:12.180 --> 03:48:13.309 align:start position:0%
requires a separate facility
um

03:48:13.309 --> 03:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:17.870 --> 03:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
for certain clinics to do abortions in
 
03:48:20.469 --> 03:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
an abortion Services is an impossible
 
03:48:23.090 --> 03:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
standard to meet
 
03:48:25.010 --> 03:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
um the clinics that exist in this state
 
03:48:27.530 --> 03:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
with their facilities are not wealthy
 
03:48:31.210 --> 03:48:31.220 align:start position:0%
they would need to construct or purchase
 
03:48:33.410 --> 03:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
separate buildings from where they are
 
03:48:36.349 --> 03:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
now which is probably impossible for
 
03:48:38.630 --> 03:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
most of them which will in reality
 
03:48:41.510 --> 03:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
require that they either close or they
 
03:48:45.650 --> 03:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
no longer perform services or no longer
 
03:48:47.809 --> 03:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
um accept or ask for Grants from the
 
03:48:47.819 --> 03:48:49.309 align:start position:0%
um accept or ask for Grants from the
state

03:48:49.309 --> 03:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:48:52.190 --> 03:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
um and we lose their services which I
 
03:48:54.290 --> 03:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
think would be disastrous for the State
 
03:48:56.469 --> 03:48:56.479 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire whether someone is
 
03:48:59.450 --> 03:48:59.460 align:start position:0%
pro-life or pro-choice
 
03:49:01.309 --> 03:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
um I still think that we need to have
 
03:49:03.050 --> 03:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
these available
 
03:49:05.870 --> 03:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
um not everybody's going to take
 
03:49:05.880 --> 03:49:06.590 align:start position:0%
um not everybody's going to take
um

03:49:06.590 --> 03:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:08.570 --> 03:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
and use these services but I think they
 
03:49:10.550 --> 03:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
should be there and as I said I don't
 
03:49:12.429 --> 03:49:12.439 align:start position:0%
think we should be deciding this policy
 
03:49:15.410 --> 03:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
in the finance committee we often say we
 
03:49:18.769 --> 03:49:18.779 align:start position:0%
don't do policy but I guess we do and I
 
03:49:20.990 --> 03:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
guess we now do it more than we ever
 
03:49:23.330 --> 03:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
have in the past
 
03:49:26.330 --> 03:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
um as I said you can argue that oh they
 
03:49:29.150 --> 03:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
can still exist but the reality is far
 
03:49:32.269 --> 03:49:32.279 align:start position:0%
different than that and we can do double
 
03:49:34.429 --> 03:49:34.439 align:start position:0%
speak we can do 1984 language
 
03:49:37.370 --> 03:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
Corrections and and say anything we want
 
03:49:39.349 --> 03:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
but if we get down to the truth of the
 
03:49:41.450 --> 03:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
matter then I think I'll see what's
 
03:49:44.809 --> 03:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
going on so I um I can't vote for this
 
03:49:47.570 --> 03:49:47.580 align:start position:0%
in addition as others have mentioned I
 
03:49:50.030 --> 03:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
can't support the total
 
03:49:50.040 --> 03:49:51.370 align:start position:0%
can't support the total
um

03:49:51.370 --> 03:49:51.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:53.210 --> 03:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
dismantling of the health and human
 
03:49:55.910 --> 03:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
services department yes there might be 3
 
03:49:57.370 --> 03:49:57.380 align:start position:0%
000 employees it's a large Department
 
03:50:00.410 --> 03:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
some would even say too large and we
 
03:50:01.729 --> 03:50:01.739 align:start position:0%
maybe should split it into separate
 
03:50:03.769 --> 03:50:03.779 align:start position:0%
departments but that doesn't mean we
 
03:50:06.590 --> 03:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
should make them work so that they can't
 
03:50:08.389 --> 03:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
perform the duties we've given them to
 
03:50:11.030 --> 03:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
form we've been through a pandemic where
 
03:50:12.530 --> 03:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
there's been hiring freezes and they
 
03:50:14.950 --> 03:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
haven't been allowed to fill vacancies
 
03:50:17.389 --> 03:50:17.399 align:start position:0%
we've shifted things on them and now
 
03:50:19.429 --> 03:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
we're just telling them to do more with
 
03:50:22.429 --> 03:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
less and that might be popular rhetoric
 
03:50:24.830 --> 03:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
to ask people to do but then when we
 
03:50:26.269 --> 03:50:26.279 align:start position:0%
come back in two years and they've been
 
03:50:28.370 --> 03:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
able to do even less than they've been
 
03:50:30.530 --> 03:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
able to do during a pandemic with
 
03:50:32.950 --> 03:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
programs other than dealing with the
 
03:50:36.410 --> 03:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
disease that's put us all here are we
 
03:50:38.990 --> 03:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
going to cut them again I hope not I
 
03:50:41.389 --> 03:50:41.399 align:start position:0%
hope then we'll maybe listen
 
03:50:44.389 --> 03:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
um so I I thank you Mr chairman for all
 
03:50:47.269 --> 03:50:47.279 align:start position:0%
the work that many of us have put in
 
03:50:49.670 --> 03:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
um but I hope that maybe we'll stop the
 
03:50:51.290 --> 03:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
rhetoric someday and actually get down
 
03:50:54.410 --> 03:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
business thank you so much
 
03:51:00.950 --> 03:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:02.809 --> 03:51:02.819 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren did you leave
 
03:51:05.030 --> 03:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
your hand up or is this something new I
 
03:51:06.650 --> 03:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
did put it up this up this time thank
 
03:51:11.510 --> 03:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:14.929 --> 03:51:14.939 align:start position:0%
as Mary Jane said I would compliment the
 
03:51:17.510 --> 03:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
staff at the department they were with
 
03:51:19.969 --> 03:51:19.979 align:start position:0%
us the whole way they met with us well
 
03:51:22.429 --> 03:51:22.439 align:start position:0%
we needed to figure things out and and
 
03:51:25.070 --> 03:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
obviously Kevin Ripple and the staff at
 
03:51:27.410 --> 03:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
LBA have been there all along the way
 
03:51:29.170 --> 03:51:29.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure they had a long weekend
 
03:51:32.090 --> 03:51:32.100 align:start position:0%
helping organize us
 
03:51:34.969 --> 03:51:34.979 align:start position:0%
um I guess it's disturbing to me having
 
03:51:38.630 --> 03:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
been here probably way too long that the
 
03:51:40.670 --> 03:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
Health Human Services budget seemed to
 
03:51:43.729 --> 03:51:43.739 align:start position:0%
have been put together by the right wing
 
03:51:48.170 --> 03:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
of the Republican party and I can't
 
03:51:51.410 --> 03:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
remember a time in my history here where
 
03:51:54.530 --> 03:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
that's been so blatantly announced to
 
03:51:54.540 --> 03:51:56.210 align:start position:0%
that's been so blatantly announced to
everybody

03:51:56.210 --> 03:51:56.220 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
03:51:56.220 --> 03:51:56.929 align:start position:0%
everybody
um

03:51:56.929 --> 03:51:56.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:00.110 --> 03:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
so I will be voting against this budget
 
03:52:02.030 --> 03:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:04.910 --> 03:52:04.920 align:start position:0%

03:52:10.910 --> 03:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
right-wing uh Republican to be a
 
03:52:12.889 --> 03:52:12.899 align:start position:0%
disparaging term but but I'll move on
 
03:52:15.110 --> 03:52:15.120 align:start position:0%

03:52:18.110 --> 03:52:18.120 align:start position:0%

03:52:52.670 --> 03:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
tried to find where we could Agree to
 
03:52:56.030 --> 03:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
Agree and obviously we did find those
 
03:52:58.910 --> 03:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
places where we can't agree but Mr

made it from 7.7 to 7.6 and that's a
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
changed in in what we had done

had adjourned our last division three
 
04:05:31.670 --> 04:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
hearing and um what what the situation
 
04:05:33.710 --> 04:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
is is that
 
04:05:37.189 --> 04:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
um as the department is integrating a
 
04:05:39.590 --> 04:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
number of services one of the
 
04:05:42.590 --> 04:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone foundational elements of the
 
04:05:45.290 --> 04:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
overall infrastructure uh is something
 
04:05:49.790 --> 04:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
referred to uh as a closed loop referral
 
04:05:53.450 --> 04:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
system it's essentially a way uh the
 
04:05:56.330 --> 04:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
closed loop part of it means regardless
 
04:05:59.150 --> 04:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
of where you are in the state as you're
 
04:06:01.330 --> 04:06:01.340 align:start position:0%
being referred from one place to another
 
04:06:05.389 --> 04:06:05.399 align:start position:0%
this I.T system provides enable enabling

technology to track those referrals uh
 
04:06:15.410 --> 04:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
it's intended to enable improved

04:06:28.070 --> 04:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
Health Food security housing security
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
and the like so so this issue is really
 
04:06:35.210 --> 04:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
one of about whether or not
 
04:06:38.210 --> 04:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
um it's been reviewed adequately from a
 
04:06:40.910 --> 04:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
privacy perspective because anyone who
 
04:06:45.110 --> 04:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
touches any uh Health Care t i t system
 
04:06:49.550 --> 04:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
in the state will potentially end up in
 
04:06:52.490 --> 04:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
this database under a master client
 
04:06:56.090 --> 04:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
index to where all referrals can be
 
04:06:58.490 --> 04:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
tracked that's the point of it
 
04:07:03.290 --> 04:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
um the the funding for this came from a
 
04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
Federal grant seven hundred thousand
 
04:07:05.520 --> 04:07:06.790 align:start position:0%
Federal grant seven hundred thousand
dollars

04:07:06.790 --> 04:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:07:09.189 --> 04:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
directly to the department
 
04:07:11.990 --> 04:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
when it came time for the executive
 
04:07:14.870 --> 04:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
Council to approve this sole source
 
04:07:17.689 --> 04:07:17.699 align:start position:0%
contract it was put on their agenda as
 
04:07:19.790 --> 04:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
informational only so the executive
 
04:07:22.070 --> 04:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
Council didn't even really look at it
 
04:07:25.010 --> 04:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
and so what this amendment is is doing
 
04:07:27.950 --> 04:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
is saying uh go ahead Department spend
 
04:07:30.170 --> 04:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
the 700 000 that you got from the
 
04:07:32.570 --> 04:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
federal funds but before you start to
 
04:07:34.929 --> 04:07:34.939 align:start position:0%
spend more than that
 
04:07:39.410 --> 04:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
you you need to subject this system to a
 
04:07:42.469 --> 04:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
privacy review by the legislature and it
 
04:07:44.809 --> 04:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
specifically calls out the House and
 
04:07:47.330 --> 04:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
Senate standing committees over help and
 
04:07:49.849 --> 04:07:49.859 align:start position:0%
Human Services and also the Health and
 
04:07:52.429 --> 04:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
Human Services oversight committee I've
 
04:07:56.229 --> 04:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
spoken with the chairman of house hhsea
 
04:07:58.729 --> 04:07:58.739 align:start position:0%
who is also the chairman of the house
 
04:08:02.389 --> 04:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
oversight and he agrees that this
 
04:08:04.849 --> 04:08:04.859 align:start position:0%
privacy issue based on other privacy
 
04:08:07.010 --> 04:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
issues that the committee has seen this
 
04:08:11.809 --> 04:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
term is something that we really need to
 
04:08:16.729 --> 04:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
look chat in light of uh our recently
 
04:08:18.950 --> 04:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
minted constitutional protection of
 
04:08:21.670 --> 04:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
privacy and
 
04:08:23.889 --> 04:08:23.899 align:start position:0%
a somewhat
 
04:08:28.070 --> 04:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
nonchalant attitude about the right of
 
04:08:31.210 --> 04:08:31.220 align:start position:0%
data ownership by the person
 
04:08:35.269 --> 04:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
so so this amendment attempts to
 
04:08:39.590 --> 04:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
establish a a privacy review before more
 
04:08:41.269 --> 04:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
money is spent
 
04:08:41.279 --> 04:08:44.229 align:start position:0%
money is spent
foreign

04:08:44.229 --> 04:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:08:50.150 --> 04:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:54.889 --> 04:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
Edward where did this amendment come
 
04:08:54.899 --> 04:08:56.570 align:start position:0%
Edward where did this amendment come
from

04:08:56.570 --> 04:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:09:00.290 --> 04:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
uh I I drafted it
 
04:09:03.050 --> 04:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
um like 12 hours after our last
 
04:09:05.929 --> 04:09:05.939 align:start position:0%
adjournment I literally did not know
 
04:09:08.689 --> 04:09:08.699 align:start position:0%
this was an issue until after we
 
04:09:11.210 --> 04:09:11.220 align:start position:0%
finished our last session so I worked
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
with Mr Ripple on an OLS on the language
 
04:09:16.729 --> 04:09:16.739 align:start position:0%
and so it's
 
04:09:19.389 --> 04:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
it's from OLS
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
so this is an amendment that's coming to
 
04:09:22.319 --> 04:09:24.229 align:start position:0%
so this is an amendment that's coming to
us

04:09:24.229 --> 04:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:09:26.750 --> 04:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
um and I don't remember I mean I
 
04:09:26.760 --> 04:09:27.710 align:start position:0%
um and I don't remember I mean I
remember

04:09:27.710 --> 04:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
remember
 
04:09:29.870 --> 04:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
having discussion I didn't remember us
 
04:09:33.530 --> 04:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
talking about this in division
 
04:09:33.540 --> 04:09:34.790 align:start position:0%
talking about this in division
about

04:09:34.790 --> 04:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:09:34.800 --> 04:09:36.110 align:start position:0%
about
um

04:09:36.110 --> 04:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:39.050 --> 04:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
closing the uh not allowing them to
 
04:09:39.060 --> 04:09:40.610 align:start position:0%
closing the uh not allowing them to
expand

04:09:40.610 --> 04:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
expand
 
04:09:42.889 --> 04:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
I know for us talking about that in
 
04:09:44.950 --> 04:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
division is that right
 
04:09:47.450 --> 04:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
it's really kind of hard for me to hear
 
04:09:50.210 --> 04:09:50.220 align:start position:0%
you because I have tinnitus and I'm
 
04:09:52.429 --> 04:09:52.439 align:start position:0%
sorry no it's it's all right I I think
 
04:09:54.410 --> 04:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
what you're asking me is did we talk
 
04:09:56.269 --> 04:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
about this in division no we didn't
 
04:09:58.670 --> 04:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
because I literally didn't know about it
 
04:10:01.429 --> 04:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
until Vision meetings had been done
 
04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
which is why I'm bringing it to the full
 
04:10:06.530 --> 04:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
committee and not having done our work
 
04:10:09.710 --> 04:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:11.689 --> 04:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
um at this point I'm I'm going to vote
 
04:10:15.110 --> 04:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
no on this uh mainly because I don't
 
04:10:16.790 --> 04:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
really have enough information and I
 
04:10:18.889 --> 04:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
don't know what I really don't know what
 
04:10:22.790 --> 04:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
the um consequences of this particular
 
04:10:25.490 --> 04:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
Amendment will be that had not had the
 
04:10:27.170 --> 04:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk with the Department
 
04:10:32.750 --> 04:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:37.670 --> 04:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:40.189 --> 04:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
oh I think it was representative Edwards
 
04:10:40.199 --> 04:10:46.750 align:start position:0%
oh I think it was representative Edwards
moved

04:10:46.750 --> 04:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:49.429 --> 04:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
yes thank you sorry I don't think you
 
04:10:51.650 --> 04:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
can see my hand up when you're standing
 
04:10:54.050 --> 04:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
there in that important podium
 
04:10:55.670 --> 04:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
um behind right behind where the hand
 
04:10:57.349 --> 04:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
goes up there's something on your wall
 
04:10:59.809 --> 04:10:59.819 align:start position:0%
that sometimes I look and I can't tell
 
04:11:01.969 --> 04:11:01.979 align:start position:0%
whether it's the hand or that thing on
 
04:11:03.550 --> 04:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
the wall sorry
 
04:11:06.229 --> 04:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
maybe I should move my chair
 
04:11:08.030 --> 04:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
um I would just like represent Edwards
 
04:11:08.040 --> 04:11:09.469 align:start position:0%
um I would just like represent Edwards
to

04:11:09.469 --> 04:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:11:12.290 --> 04:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
in more detail the role of the House and
 
04:11:15.290 --> 04:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
Senate I guess it's a little vague to me
 
04:11:18.050 --> 04:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
and I share the concerns that
 
04:11:20.450 --> 04:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner has that we
 
04:11:22.210 --> 04:11:22.220 align:start position:0%
really don't
 
04:11:25.550 --> 04:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
understand what this means because we
 
04:11:28.510 --> 04:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
just saw it on a piece of paper so maybe
 
04:11:30.650 --> 04:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards could explain
 
04:11:33.349 --> 04:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
more what the role of the House and
 
04:11:37.370 --> 04:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:39.950 --> 04:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question I I would
 
04:11:43.429 --> 04:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
describe the role as uh the people's
 
04:11:48.050 --> 04:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
representative the people voted 81 82
 
04:11:50.689 --> 04:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
percent just a couple of years ago to
 
04:11:53.570 --> 04:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
establish a right to privacy in the New
 
04:11:57.229 --> 04:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution and this I.T
 
04:11:59.630 --> 04:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
system is
 
04:11:59.640 --> 04:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
system is
um

04:11:59.920 --> 04:11:59.930 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:59.930 --> 04:12:01.090 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

04:12:01.090 --> 04:12:01.100 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:12:05.030 --> 04:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
particularly assertive at reaching out
 
04:12:08.630 --> 04:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
and in an interconnected Network kind of
 
04:12:08.640 --> 04:12:09.610 align:start position:0%
and in an interconnected Network kind of
way

04:12:09.610 --> 04:12:09.620 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:12:12.189 --> 04:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
being able to pull
 
04:12:15.610 --> 04:12:15.620 align:start position:0%
records on individuals from
 
04:12:19.570 --> 04:12:19.580 align:start position:0%
widely disparate Health Systems and
 
04:12:22.969 --> 04:12:22.979 align:start position:0%
community-based services systems so that
 
04:12:26.269 --> 04:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
so that so that care coordinators can
 
04:12:31.030 --> 04:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
see in one snapshot all of the services
 
04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
that are touching uh each client that's
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
in the database and so there are things
 
04:12:43.330 --> 04:12:43.340 align:start position:0%
such as uh has the client
 
04:12:45.950 --> 04:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
provided consent
 
04:12:49.370 --> 04:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
to the extent to which data will be
 
04:12:51.889 --> 04:12:51.899 align:start position:0%
pulled together from a wide range of
 
04:12:51.899 --> 04:12:53.030 align:start position:0%
pulled together from a wide range of
systems

04:12:53.030 --> 04:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
systems
 
04:12:57.769 --> 04:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
has the client uh given permission for
 
04:13:00.889 --> 04:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
his or her information to be shared by
 
04:13:04.630 --> 04:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
anyone who happens to be in the network
 
04:13:10.809 --> 04:13:10.819 align:start position:0%
as has the client uh been able to say
 
04:13:13.969 --> 04:13:13.979 align:start position:0%
these groups can use my information but
 
04:13:16.929 --> 04:13:16.939 align:start position:0%
these groups cannot
 
04:13:21.290 --> 04:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
can the client ask at a subsequent date
 
04:13:25.510 --> 04:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
for the system to delete and forget
 
04:13:28.370 --> 04:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
those things that can be deleted or
 
04:13:31.429 --> 04:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
forgotten medical information can't be
 
04:13:34.429 --> 04:13:34.439 align:start position:0%
deleted but other things such as
 
04:13:38.510 --> 04:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
Community contacts uh at a at a food
 
04:13:41.929 --> 04:13:41.939 align:start position:0%
pantry or or clothing distribution site
 
04:13:44.929 --> 04:13:44.939 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things gotten so so
 
04:13:46.510 --> 04:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
there's an entire
 
04:13:50.650 --> 04:13:50.660 align:start position:0%
client privacy set of issues here
 
04:13:53.809 --> 04:13:53.819 align:start position:0%
that no one other than the department
 
04:13:57.349 --> 04:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
has looked at and this particular system
 
04:14:00.110 --> 04:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
the closed loop referral system is
 
04:14:00.120 --> 04:14:01.429 align:start position:0%
the closed loop referral system is
really

04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:14:04.330 --> 04:14:04.340 align:start position:0%
um seems to be like the central
 
04:14:07.610 --> 04:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
connecting Hub within the entire network
 
04:14:11.229 --> 04:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
to make sure that all of the records
 
04:14:14.990 --> 04:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
across the community-based providers can
 
04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
be integrated to create a single
 
04:14:21.349 --> 04:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
snapshot of all of those contact points
 
04:14:25.010 --> 04:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
with the community as such it's got a
 
04:14:26.210 --> 04:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of personal
 
04:14:28.610 --> 04:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
information in it a lot of personal
 
04:14:30.670 --> 04:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
health information
 
04:14:35.809 --> 04:14:35.819 align:start position:0%
and so uh so it should be subject to
 
04:14:38.750 --> 04:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
review by the people's body to make sure
 
04:14:41.030 --> 04:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
that the Privacy rights of the people
 
04:14:44.630 --> 04:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
are being protected
 
04:14:46.689 --> 04:14:46.699 align:start position:0%
and I don't think
 
04:14:50.750 --> 04:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
most of us are even aware that this was
 
04:14:53.330 --> 04:14:53.340 align:start position:0%
existing with all this access to our
 
04:14:55.070 --> 04:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
information you had further
 
04:14:56.689 --> 04:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner
 
04:15:00.229 --> 04:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
norgren so so
 
04:15:01.429 --> 04:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
can you
 
04:15:03.950 --> 04:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
tell me again what would the Senate and
 
04:15:03.960 --> 04:15:05.929 align:start position:0%
tell me again what would the Senate and
House

04:15:05.929 --> 04:15:05.939 align:start position:0%
House
 
04:15:08.210 --> 04:15:08.220 align:start position:0%
plan to do would they have hearings
 
04:15:11.090 --> 04:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
would they create a bill would they have
 
04:15:14.210 --> 04:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
legislation next session I guess I don't
 
04:15:17.750 --> 04:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
understand your plans or how the House
 
04:15:20.269 --> 04:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
and Senate would be involved
 
04:15:24.229 --> 04:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
well well specifically it calls out the
 
04:15:26.150 --> 04:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services foresight
 
04:15:28.670 --> 04:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
committee as an example and the chairman
 
04:15:30.650 --> 04:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
of the Health and Human Services
 
04:15:33.889 --> 04:15:33.899 align:start position:0%
oversight committee is
 
04:15:33.899 --> 04:15:35.090 align:start position:0%
oversight committee is
um

04:15:35.090 --> 04:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:38.389 --> 04:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
working with the Department to add this
 
04:15:41.689 --> 04:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
topic to the agenda that's set in April
 
04:15:46.389 --> 04:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
and so we will uh I'm on that committee
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
and the other person that's on the
 
04:15:48.960 --> 04:15:50.269 align:start position:0%
and the other person that's on the
committee

04:15:50.269 --> 04:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:15:53.330 --> 04:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
um a representative saloway the three of
 
04:15:56.809 --> 04:15:56.819 align:start position:0%
us have talked and said that this is a
 
04:16:02.110 --> 04:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
pretty significant issue to be moving
 
04:16:06.110 --> 04:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
so rapidly without oversight of anyone
 
04:16:08.330 --> 04:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
in the legislature and when the
 
04:16:10.429 --> 04:16:10.439 align:start position:0%
executive Council had an opportunity to
 
04:16:13.429 --> 04:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
look at it they simply had an
 
04:16:16.490 --> 04:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
information piece on it so so might
 
04:16:18.830 --> 04:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
there be a bill or something come out of
 
04:16:22.130 --> 04:16:22.140 align:start position:0%
it uh they're they're very well maybe
 
04:16:24.410 --> 04:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
um but I I can't prejudge the
 
04:16:27.410 --> 04:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
information the department May in fact
 
04:16:31.309 --> 04:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
have outstanding you know industry
 
04:16:34.610 --> 04:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
standard consent forms and and
 
04:16:37.490 --> 04:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
information about how their information
 
04:16:42.050 --> 04:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
is getting used and how uh if any if if
 
04:16:44.630 --> 04:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
the client has any ability to be
 
04:16:46.790 --> 04:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
forgotten by the network it all of that
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
could be perfect and it would come
 
04:16:50.809 --> 04:16:50.819 align:start position:0%
across very quickly in an oversight
 
04:16:53.510 --> 04:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
committee and the issue would be dropped
 
04:16:55.910 --> 04:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
I think but we don't know what we don't
 
04:16:58.429 --> 04:16:58.439 align:start position:0%
know yet we just know that it's big
 
04:17:01.929 --> 04:17:01.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:03.650 --> 04:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
representative Rogers and then
 
04:17:05.450 --> 04:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
 
04:17:07.910 --> 04:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
yes I just have a question
 
04:17:10.070 --> 04:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
um actually have you talked to the
 
04:17:12.650 --> 04:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
department and did they have any input
 
04:17:15.130 --> 04:17:15.140 align:start position:0%
into this at all
 
04:17:18.050 --> 04:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
no the department did not talk to me as
 
04:17:20.030 --> 04:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
the chairman of division three very
 
04:17:22.670 --> 04:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
interested in I.T issues very much
 
04:17:25.370 --> 04:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
involved with them on the mmis issue the
 
04:17:29.510 --> 04:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
ADT issue this issue was not brought to
 
04:17:33.650 --> 04:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
me and it it and and it had gone largely
 
04:17:36.229 --> 04:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
it would have gone completely unaware to
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
me had it not been told to me by a
 
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
concerned citizen of privacy advocate so
 
04:17:46.010 --> 04:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
so because of the shortness of time
 
04:17:48.710 --> 04:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
getting the amendment and all no the
 
04:17:51.110 --> 04:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
Department's not been consulted but they
 
04:17:55.250 --> 04:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
would be consulted if if HHS oversight
 
04:17:58.189 --> 04:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
adds them to the agenda in April
 
04:18:00.950 --> 04:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
and if I could do a follow-up
 
04:18:04.010 --> 04:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up what what would it be
 
04:18:06.410 --> 04:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
better to bring this to the Senate so
 
04:18:08.630 --> 04:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
that they would have the time to consult
 
04:18:11.330 --> 04:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
with the department and um and take a
 
04:18:13.670 --> 04:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
little more time looking at it
 
04:18:16.189 --> 04:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
well uh there's a couple of different
 
04:18:18.050 --> 04:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
ways of getting into the Senate as you
 
04:18:19.729 --> 04:18:19.739 align:start position:0%
know I mean we could pass it in the
 
04:18:21.590 --> 04:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
Senate will see it because it's the
 
04:18:23.990 --> 04:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
house position at that point
 
04:18:25.429 --> 04:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
um or
 
04:18:28.429 --> 04:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
um uh it could be administratively
 
04:18:30.889 --> 04:18:30.899 align:start position:0%
handed and coordinated with them I I
 
04:18:32.450 --> 04:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
don't know which way would be preferable
 
04:18:35.570 --> 04:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
in this situation I'm advocating that we
 
04:18:39.110 --> 04:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead and add it hb2 to be clear that
 
04:18:41.929 --> 04:18:41.939 align:start position:0%
the uh to do our best to make sure the
 
04:18:45.410 --> 04:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
Senate sees it because the Privacy
 
04:18:48.769 --> 04:18:48.779 align:start position:0%
aspect of this is potentially enormous
 
04:18:52.870 --> 04:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
and it's just really worth checking on
 
04:18:54.950 --> 04:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
I'm just concerned representative
 
04:18:56.570 --> 04:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
because you're the only one that's had
 
04:18:58.790 --> 04:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
time to look at this the division hasn't
 
04:19:00.349 --> 04:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
the department hasn't
 
04:19:02.450 --> 04:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
um if it goes to the Senate as a
 
04:19:05.150 --> 04:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
suggested Amendment it gives time for
 
04:19:07.429 --> 04:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
the Senate to look at it more in depth
 
04:19:09.769 --> 04:19:09.779 align:start position:0%
without us putting in we don't know what
 
04:19:11.269 --> 04:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
our position is right now we know what
 
04:19:13.309 --> 04:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
your position is but none of the rest of
 
04:19:14.929 --> 04:19:14.939 align:start position:0%
us have had a chance to really give it
 
04:19:17.389 --> 04:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
the time it deserves so that's why I
 
04:19:19.309 --> 04:19:19.319 align:start position:0%
guess I would prefer
 
04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
um that you bring it to the Senate and
 
04:19:22.910 --> 04:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
suggest that they add it in there when
 
04:19:25.010 --> 04:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
they've had time to look at it and not
 
04:19:26.750 --> 04:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
ask us to take a position on something
 
04:19:29.330 --> 04:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
that we know a little about thank you
 
04:19:30.429 --> 04:19:30.439 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:19:32.870 --> 04:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative it's a very fair comment
 
04:19:35.510 --> 04:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
and for completeness representative erf
 
04:19:37.969 --> 04:19:37.979 align:start position:0%
has also looked at this at an extent
 
04:19:40.630 --> 04:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
equal to my own
 
04:19:42.650 --> 04:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn yeah you know I
 
04:19:46.370 --> 04:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
guess I just have a question I I'm
 
04:19:49.250 --> 04:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
my understanding I mean from from you
 
04:19:51.469 --> 04:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
know seeing doctors that I've seen is
 
04:19:54.349 --> 04:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
that they that this kind of thing is
 
04:19:56.389 --> 04:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
pretty standard in other words I I think
 
04:19:59.210 --> 04:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
that the my understanding is that you
 
04:20:01.010 --> 04:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
know I've that
 
04:20:03.349 --> 04:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
I I have seen a number of doctors for
 
04:20:05.030 --> 04:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
different things and that all of them
 
04:20:07.490 --> 04:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
have all of the information now uh you
 
04:20:09.710 --> 04:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
know because it's computerized and and
 
04:20:11.450 --> 04:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
actually I think that's pretty much a
 
04:20:13.370 --> 04:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
good thing um I understand your private
 
04:20:15.710 --> 04:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
privacy concerns you raise
 
04:20:18.349 --> 04:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
um but I guess what I'm wondering is
 
04:20:20.990 --> 04:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure why we're singling
 
04:20:25.070 --> 04:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
out this particular situation
 
04:20:26.990 --> 04:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
um I mean maybe there should I'm not
 
04:20:28.550 --> 04:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily saying I'm opposed to having
 
04:20:31.070 --> 04:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
a privacy inquiry into these kind of
 
04:20:33.349 --> 04:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
things but I'm not quite sure why it
 
04:20:34.849 --> 04:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
would be limited
 
04:20:36.650 --> 04:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
to this because as I say my
 
04:20:38.870 --> 04:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is and I think you know as
 
04:20:40.309 --> 04:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
to the extent that I
 
04:20:41.870 --> 04:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
that I know this I think that it's
 
04:20:43.610 --> 04:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
pretty standard for this kind of stuff
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
to be to be done and I and generally
 
04:20:49.490 --> 04:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
there are these consent forms that you
 
04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
know I'm I'm sure I've signed a million
 
04:20:53.210 --> 04:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
of these consent forms and I've never
 
04:20:55.309 --> 04:20:55.319 align:start position:0%
really paid I haven't really read very
 
04:20:57.229 --> 04:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
closely because
 
04:20:59.630 --> 04:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
frankly I didn't care all that much
 
04:21:01.370 --> 04:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
but that's that's really my question is
 
04:21:03.050 --> 04:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
this do we know that this isn't really
 
04:21:07.610 --> 04:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
very widespread Beyond this one contract
 
04:21:11.090 --> 04:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question and
 
04:21:14.150 --> 04:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
um the closed loop referral system is
 
04:21:18.790 --> 04:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
essentially intended to be a a a a a hub
 
04:21:22.130 --> 04:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
that uh with in conjunction with the
 
04:21:25.490 --> 04:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
master client index which is a unique
 
04:21:28.070 --> 04:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
identifier for every individual that
 
04:21:31.010 --> 04:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
touches the system that Master client
 
04:21:33.469 --> 04:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
index and the interconnection that's
 
04:21:35.630 --> 04:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
planned for what they refer to as the
 
04:21:35.640 --> 04:21:36.729 align:start position:0%
planned for what they refer to as the
network

04:21:36.729 --> 04:21:36.739 align:start position:0%
network
 
04:21:41.450 --> 04:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
can extend to every medical information
 
04:21:45.410 --> 04:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
system in the state in every community
 
04:21:49.929 --> 04:21:49.939 align:start position:0%
based service in the state so if a a
 
04:21:52.670 --> 04:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
community-based service is providing
 
04:21:54.650 --> 04:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
transition housing or other housing
 
04:21:57.769 --> 04:21:57.779 align:start position:0%
assistance or dealing with the food
 
04:22:00.370 --> 04:22:00.380 align:start position:0%
insecurity issue or coordinating
 
04:22:04.010 --> 04:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
Transportation or the child advocate has
 
04:22:06.530 --> 04:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
been called out to the site or law
 
04:22:09.469 --> 04:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement has gotten there this is
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
this is not just your doctor taking your
 
04:22:16.370 --> 04:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
medical information and on that consent
 
04:22:19.370 --> 04:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
form it says I would like to be able to
 
04:22:21.950 --> 04:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
share this medical information with
 
04:22:24.950 --> 04:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
other people who I will involve in your
 
04:22:26.090 --> 04:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
health care
 
04:22:29.150 --> 04:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
on the and so so when you are signing
 
04:22:31.729 --> 04:22:31.739 align:start position:0%
that consent form you are allowing that
 
04:22:34.670 --> 04:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
provider to share but the sharing is
 
04:22:37.670 --> 04:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
specifically defined in the typical
 
04:22:41.769 --> 04:22:41.779 align:start position:0%
consent form to taking care of your
 
04:22:43.809 --> 04:22:43.819 align:start position:0%
Health Care
 
04:22:46.610 --> 04:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
consistent with the what the provider is
 
04:22:48.530 --> 04:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
doing for you so it's an arrangement
 
04:22:51.889 --> 04:22:51.899 align:start position:0%
between doctors this is totally
 
04:22:54.469 --> 04:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
different this is a this is a network
 
04:23:00.410 --> 04:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
that any system that touches any service
 
04:23:02.630 --> 04:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
that you get from the state or the
 
04:23:05.929 --> 04:23:05.939 align:start position:0%
government can interconnect so there is
 
04:23:10.969 --> 04:23:10.979 align:start position:0%
a One-Stop shop for the entire array of
 
04:23:13.550 --> 04:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
everything about you where you've
 
04:23:13.560 --> 04:23:14.990 align:start position:0%
everything about you where you've
touched

04:23:14.990 --> 04:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
touched
 
04:23:18.110 --> 04:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
one of the services okay so it's it's
 
04:23:22.490 --> 04:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's 10 to 100 times the magnitude of of
 
04:23:25.969 --> 04:23:25.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:25.979 --> 04:23:29.030 align:start position:0%
 
is

04:23:29.030 --> 04:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
do you is there is there some kind of a
 
04:23:31.920 --> 04:23:33.229 align:start position:0%
do you is there is there some kind of a
consent

04:23:33.229 --> 04:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
consent
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
form or we just don't know I I haven't
 
04:23:38.570 --> 04:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
reviewed it I've been told that it says
 
04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
that you consent to share your
 
04:23:43.250 --> 04:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
information within the network and then
 
04:23:45.830 --> 04:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
the question is is Network defined in a
 
04:23:47.630 --> 04:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
way in which you can reasonably
 
04:23:51.590 --> 04:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
understand the comprehensive nature of
 
04:23:53.689 --> 04:23:53.699 align:start position:0%
all of the data that's being compiled
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
and integrated so you could go yeah
 
04:23:58.370 --> 04:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
Network that sounds good but then you
 
04:24:00.590 --> 04:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
don't know what's in the network is law
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement in the network is the food
 
04:24:05.450 --> 04:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
pantry in the network is is the domestic
 
04:24:07.090 --> 04:24:07.100 align:start position:0%
violence program in the network
 
04:24:09.650 --> 04:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
everything about you
 
04:24:12.950 --> 04:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
can be in that Network
 
04:24:15.710 --> 04:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
it seems okay and that's why we want to
 
04:24:18.290 --> 04:24:18.300 align:start position:0%
look into it to make sure that you're
 
04:24:20.030 --> 04:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
protected that you know what you're
 
04:24:21.910 --> 04:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
consenting to
 
04:24:25.130 --> 04:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you appreciate it all
 
04:24:28.070 --> 04:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
right so next I have representative erft
 
04:24:29.389 --> 04:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
and representative walner then
 
04:24:33.590 --> 04:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:33.600 --> 04:24:35.389 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:24:35.389 --> 04:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:37.910 --> 04:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
it even goes beyond what
 
04:24:39.590 --> 04:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards was referring to
 
04:24:43.490 --> 04:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
it's not only state and government
 
04:24:46.309 --> 04:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
it's Meals on Wheels it's
 
04:24:49.370 --> 04:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
the idn it's your marriage counselor
 
04:24:51.710 --> 04:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
it's anybody
 
04:24:53.570 --> 04:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
and as far as the
 
04:24:56.090 --> 04:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
what we've talked about here right now I
 
04:24:57.830 --> 04:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
would think the questions that we have
 
04:24:57.840 --> 04:24:58.849 align:start position:0%
would think the questions that we have
here

04:24:58.849 --> 04:24:58.859 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:25:01.550 --> 04:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
would give us pause
 
04:25:04.729 --> 04:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
that the department did not come to us
 
04:25:06.830 --> 04:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
to ask us to implement a new program
 
04:25:09.590 --> 04:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
which is what this is
 
04:25:12.769 --> 04:25:12.779 align:start position:0%
as representative Edwards says not even
 
04:25:16.790 --> 04:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
the executive Council was able to take a
 
04:25:18.950 --> 04:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
vote on this
 
04:25:21.290 --> 04:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
as far as the consent goes
 
04:25:21.300 --> 04:25:22.969 align:start position:0%
as far as the consent goes
currently

04:25:22.969 --> 04:25:22.979 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:25:25.429 --> 04:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
it's basically a lot of gibberish the
 
04:25:26.750 --> 04:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
kind of same sort of thing you get when
 
04:25:28.969 --> 04:25:28.979 align:start position:0%
you go and get a download a free app
 
04:25:28.979 --> 04:25:30.050 align:start position:0%
you go and get a download a free app
from

04:25:30.050 --> 04:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
your phone store
 
04:25:34.490 --> 04:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
and you agree
 
04:25:36.469 --> 04:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
furthermore you got to imagine that many
 
04:25:36.479 --> 04:25:37.250 align:start position:0%
furthermore you got to imagine that many
people

04:25:37.250 --> 04:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:25:40.309 --> 04:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
in this situation are and not a great
 
04:25:42.469 --> 04:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
place mentally
 
04:25:44.090 --> 04:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
looking for food or they're looking for
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
counseling or whatever their client just
 
04:25:47.750 --> 04:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
to do is
 
04:25:49.729 --> 04:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
what you do when you get a free app
 
04:25:53.689 --> 04:25:53.699 align:start position:0%
agree it's a one-time agreement that
 
04:25:56.929 --> 04:25:56.939 align:start position:0%
cannot be rescinded that lasts in
 
04:25:56.939 --> 04:25:58.670 align:start position:0%
cannot be rescinded that lasts in
perpetuity

04:25:58.670 --> 04:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
perpetuity
 
04:26:00.710 --> 04:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
and basically anybody in the quote
 
04:26:00.720 --> 04:26:01.849 align:start position:0%
and basically anybody in the quote
Network

04:26:01.849 --> 04:26:01.859 align:start position:0%
Network
 
04:26:03.050 --> 04:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
and that includes not just government
 
04:26:05.389 --> 04:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
officials but these private entities as
 
04:26:10.010 --> 04:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
well have access to your data so it's
 
04:26:11.269 --> 04:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
pretty clear
 
04:26:13.670 --> 04:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
when I heard about this I was stunned
 
04:26:16.490 --> 04:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
that's a program like this sole source
 
04:26:19.010 --> 04:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
contract not put out to bid
 
04:26:22.490 --> 04:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
the next phase that's been requested is
 
04:26:24.710 --> 04:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
again sole source contract
 
04:26:26.389 --> 04:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
not put out to bid
 
04:26:29.030 --> 04:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
a system like this with the same
 
04:26:29.040 --> 04:26:30.649 align:start position:0%
a system like this with the same
company

04:26:30.649 --> 04:26:30.659 align:start position:0%
company
 
04:26:33.110 --> 04:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
was put into I believe North Carolina
 
04:26:35.870 --> 04:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
had a eight million dollar price tag as
 
04:26:37.189 --> 04:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
I recall
 
04:26:39.769 --> 04:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
we're doing the same thing apparently
 
04:26:42.290 --> 04:26:42.300 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania also looked at this
 
04:26:44.990 --> 04:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
they on the other hand put it out to bid
 
04:26:46.729 --> 04:26:46.739 align:start position:0%
and their contract came back at two
 
04:26:48.349 --> 04:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
04:26:50.269 --> 04:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
so there seemed to be quite a few
 
04:26:51.889 --> 04:26:51.899 align:start position:0%
questions around this the kinds of
 
04:26:54.889 --> 04:26:54.899 align:start position:0%
things that I think the legislature is
 
04:26:56.450 --> 04:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
intended to
 
04:26:59.929 --> 04:26:59.939 align:start position:0%
look at and come up with the proper
 
04:27:02.030 --> 04:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
legislative approach
 
04:27:04.189 --> 04:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the governor to
 
04:27:06.769 --> 04:27:06.779 align:start position:0%
implementing thank you Mr chairman thank
 
04:27:06.779 --> 04:27:07.910 align:start position:0%
implementing thank you Mr chairman thank
you

04:27:07.910 --> 04:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:27:13.370 --> 04:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:17.570 --> 04:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
intent of this amendment included in any
 
04:27:19.929 --> 04:27:19.939 align:start position:0%
um legislation that's presently before
 
04:27:23.870 --> 04:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
one of the Committees in the house
 
04:27:28.010 --> 04:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:29.809 --> 04:27:29.819 align:start position:0%
it seems like the Health and Human
 
04:27:35.030 --> 04:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:38.269 --> 04:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
uh as as I understand the issue that
 
04:27:41.630 --> 04:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
they've dealt with it was an issue of
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
opt-in and opt out of a particular
 
04:27:48.590 --> 04:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
information system and this is and and
 
04:27:51.710 --> 04:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
and based on the input that they got
 
04:27:55.010 --> 04:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
from the department and on that I.T
 
04:27:58.010 --> 04:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
system that there is a concern amongst
 
04:28:01.250 --> 04:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
many on in that committee that the
 
04:28:01.260 --> 04:28:02.149 align:start position:0%
many on in that committee that the
department

04:28:02.149 --> 04:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:28:06.889 --> 04:28:06.899 align:start position:0%
does not have a due respect for an
 
04:28:08.809 --> 04:28:08.819 align:start position:0%
individual's privacy right and to
 
04:28:11.750 --> 04:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
control their personal data and and so
 
04:28:14.389 --> 04:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
and that instance that you're referring
 
04:28:18.050 --> 04:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
to was just one system this closed-loop
 
04:28:21.290 --> 04:28:21.300 align:start position:0%
system is going to interconnect with the
 
04:28:23.450 --> 04:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
everything in the department and Beyond
 
04:28:26.269 --> 04:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
as representative or said so it's it's
 
04:28:29.210 --> 04:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
it's it's something very different than
 
04:28:32.809 --> 04:28:32.819 align:start position:0%
what HHS looked at in you say 601 I'll
 
04:28:34.910 --> 04:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
believe it
 
04:28:38.090 --> 04:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't it be better at this point
 
04:28:38.100 --> 04:28:39.290 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't it be better at this point
for

04:28:39.290 --> 04:28:39.300 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:28:40.910 --> 04:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Service committee
 
04:28:43.670 --> 04:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
since they've already started looking at
 
04:28:45.530 --> 04:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
this I mean it might be just one
 
04:28:47.570 --> 04:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
contract but they're already looking at
 
04:28:49.910 --> 04:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't it be better for them to
 
04:28:52.309 --> 04:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
continue their work in this area I mean
 
04:28:54.769 --> 04:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
it sounds like this is an issue that
 
04:28:54.779 --> 04:28:56.330 align:start position:0%
it sounds like this is an issue that
needs

04:28:56.330 --> 04:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
needs
 
04:28:59.269 --> 04:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
um to have a public hearing needs to
 
04:29:01.370 --> 04:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
gather a lot more information than what
 
04:29:02.689 --> 04:29:02.699 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to get here
 
04:29:06.649 --> 04:29:06.659 align:start position:0%
between the 15 of us today right 20 of
 
04:29:10.670 --> 04:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
us so so what this amendment does is it
 
04:29:14.090 --> 04:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
basically Flags the issue and requires
 
04:29:16.309 --> 04:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
that it go before a House and Senate
 
04:29:20.510 --> 04:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
standing committee over HHS and to the
 
04:29:24.290 --> 04:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
HHS oversight foreign except that what
 
04:29:27.710 --> 04:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
it does is it prohibits the department
 
04:29:30.710 --> 04:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
um from expanding any services at this
 
04:29:34.490 --> 04:29:34.500 align:start position:0%
point so I mean it does both but right
 
04:29:36.950 --> 04:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
it does it also does uh prohibit that
 
04:29:39.590 --> 04:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
they get to spend the whole 700 000 that
 
04:29:41.830 --> 04:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
they were given on a direct
 
04:29:43.550 --> 04:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation from the federal
 
04:29:48.070 --> 04:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
government but to expand beyond that
 
04:29:50.450 --> 04:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
we need to take a look at it that's
 
04:29:54.710 --> 04:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:02.090 --> 04:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:04.610 --> 04:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
I think my concern is we're in the 11th
 
04:30:06.710 --> 04:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
inning of our action on a budget bill
 
04:30:10.790 --> 04:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's before us this obviously
 
04:30:12.550 --> 04:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
needs a lot more
 
04:30:16.910 --> 04:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
discussion a lot a lot more research and
 
04:30:19.370 --> 04:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
a lot more information provided to those
 
04:30:21.649 --> 04:30:21.659 align:start position:0%
of us that need to vote on someone
 
04:30:23.389 --> 04:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
so I would
 
04:30:26.510 --> 04:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully asked and the unfairest of
 
04:30:28.849 --> 04:30:28.859 align:start position:0%
me not to be embanked about something
 
04:30:28.859 --> 04:30:29.990 align:start position:0%
me not to be embanked about something
but

04:30:29.990 --> 04:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:30:32.149 --> 04:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
um maybe it would be prudent for us to
 
04:30:35.210 --> 04:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
withdraw this amendment for right now I
 
04:30:38.570 --> 04:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
don't understand why we urgently need to
 
04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
address this now
 
04:30:43.849 --> 04:30:43.859 align:start position:0%
there's going to be tons of opportunity
 
04:30:46.610 --> 04:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
in the very near future to address this
 
04:30:49.790 --> 04:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
appropriately and properly but maybe we
 
04:30:52.070 --> 04:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
should consider doing that just that so
 
04:30:54.649 --> 04:30:54.659 align:start position:0%
I would ask respectfully if maybe this
 
04:30:56.689 --> 04:30:56.699 align:start position:0%
amendment could be withdrawn
 
04:30:59.149 --> 04:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
and we can go forward forward with the
 
04:31:02.330 --> 04:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
business of the day thank you Mr chair
 
04:31:03.950 --> 04:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:31:07.370 --> 04:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:08.990 --> 04:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren have you got
 
04:31:10.130 --> 04:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
04:31:11.990 --> 04:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'll come to you next
 
04:31:13.729 --> 04:31:13.739 align:start position:0%
with all due respect
 
04:31:15.769 --> 04:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
the last few
 
04:31:19.790 --> 04:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
points are making the point
 
04:31:22.550 --> 04:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
this initial contract
 
04:31:26.450 --> 04:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
was entered into without any oversight
 
04:31:28.370 --> 04:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
they're currently looking to and enter
 
04:31:31.130 --> 04:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
into an 8.1 million dollar contract
 
04:31:33.830 --> 04:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
without any further oversight
 
04:31:35.750 --> 04:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
these are federal dollars coming from
 
04:31:37.250 --> 04:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
04:31:40.729 --> 04:31:40.739 align:start position:0%
can we as legislators should be able to
 
04:31:43.309 --> 04:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
have some input into what kind of
 
04:31:45.410 --> 04:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
programs are being implemented in the
 
04:31:46.670 --> 04:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
04:31:48.950 --> 04:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
so it is actually imperative
 
04:31:51.170 --> 04:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
that we implement this now it's not that
 
04:31:52.689 --> 04:31:52.699 align:start position:0%
we're taking anything away from anybody
 
04:31:55.070 --> 04:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
we're putting in place something to do
 
04:31:57.889 --> 04:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
exactly what has been pointed out here
 
04:32:00.769 --> 04:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
the legislature should be involved and
 
04:32:02.990 --> 04:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
all this is doing is saying exactly that
 
04:32:05.210 --> 04:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
and the Senate would like us to take a
 
04:32:06.590 --> 04:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
position just as they'd like us to take
 
04:32:08.689 --> 04:32:08.699 align:start position:0%
a position on a variety of things so
 
04:32:11.149 --> 04:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
they know what the house position is
 
04:32:13.070 --> 04:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
when things get to them you're
 
04:32:14.570 --> 04:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
absolutely right when it gets to the
 
04:32:15.889 --> 04:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
Senate they'll definitely look at it
 
04:32:17.689 --> 04:32:17.699 align:start position:0%
they may take it out
 
04:32:19.610 --> 04:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
but they also may say you know we need
 
04:32:21.649 --> 04:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
to look into this more deeply and we
 
04:32:23.389 --> 04:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
need to allow the legislative process to
 
04:32:25.490 --> 04:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
work the way the legislative process is
 
04:32:26.750 --> 04:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
intended to work
 
04:32:28.370 --> 04:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:32:31.550 --> 04:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative noidgren uh I didn't have
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:36.950 --> 04:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn yeah you know as
 
04:32:38.929 --> 04:32:38.939 align:start position:0%
I've as I've looked at this language
 
04:32:43.309 --> 04:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
though I I guess I I'm I'm sort of
 
04:32:45.110 --> 04:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
persuaded by one of the comments that
 
04:32:48.170 --> 04:32:48.180 align:start position:0%
was made earlier uh
 
04:32:51.710 --> 04:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
um it says that though that the there
 
04:32:53.510 --> 04:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
should be no further expansion of this
 
04:32:56.030 --> 04:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
of the contract
 
04:32:58.130 --> 04:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
um in the amount of 700 000 but then
 
04:32:59.870 --> 04:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
when you read the next sentence
 
04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
the closed loop referral system shall
 
04:33:04.310 --> 04:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
not be made available to or or
 
04:33:06.470 --> 04:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
accessible by members of the general
 
04:33:08.750 --> 04:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
public or the department
 
04:33:10.970 --> 04:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
prior to the enactment of legislation so
 
04:33:13.429 --> 04:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
what if the situation is that yes
 
04:33:15.349 --> 04:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
they've entered into this 700 000
 
04:33:17.810 --> 04:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
contract but they've only spent a
 
04:33:19.310 --> 04:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars of it and there
 
04:33:21.170 --> 04:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
are other people who would want to take
 
04:33:23.330 --> 04:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
advantage of it under the contract can
 
04:33:25.209 --> 04:33:25.219 align:start position:0%
they do it or not I see a sort of
 
04:33:27.709 --> 04:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
section one would say where the first
 
04:33:29.150 --> 04:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
sentence which seem to say well maybe
 
04:33:30.769 --> 04:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
they can but the second sentence would
 
04:33:32.631 --> 04:33:32.641 align:start position:0%
seem to say no
 
04:33:34.789 --> 04:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
um that they that they can't that that
 
04:33:36.230 --> 04:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
because that would be a further that
 
04:33:38.209 --> 04:33:38.219 align:start position:0%
would be an expansion that would be uh
 
04:33:38.219 --> 04:33:40.310 align:start position:0%
would be an expansion that would be uh
uh

04:33:40.310 --> 04:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:42.949 --> 04:33:42.959 align:start position:0%
shall be made no the the closed loop
 
04:33:44.390 --> 04:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
referral system shall not be made
 
04:33:47.090 --> 04:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
available to or accessible so if I'm if
 
04:33:49.551 --> 04:33:49.561 align:start position:0%
I'm the person that's going to get
 
04:33:51.890 --> 04:33:51.900 align:start position:0%
that would be would would be taking
 
04:33:53.689 --> 04:33:53.699 align:start position:0%
advantage of the contract because it
 
04:33:57.170 --> 04:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
hasn't been fully expended but I'm not I
 
04:33:58.789 --> 04:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
don't take advantage of it you know
 
04:34:01.970 --> 04:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
before this law is enacted can
 
04:34:04.910 --> 04:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
can I can the department offer that to
 
04:34:06.529 --> 04:34:06.539 align:start position:0%
me if it's within the seven hundred
 
04:34:06.539 --> 04:34:08.090 align:start position:0%
me if it's within the seven hundred
thousand

04:34:08.090 --> 04:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
04:34:11.029 --> 04:34:11.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I I sit here
 
04:34:13.670 --> 04:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
thinking to myself if only I could find
 
04:34:17.689 --> 04:34:17.699 align:start position:0%
a lawyer to ask about that uh but uh
 
04:34:21.949 --> 04:34:21.959 align:start position:0%
but uh I'm not a lawyer uh this got
 
04:34:26.330 --> 04:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
drafted by OLS at my uh request and I
 
04:34:28.310 --> 04:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
had some conditions I was trying to meet
 
04:34:32.929 --> 04:34:32.939 align:start position:0%
my primary uh motivator is
 
04:34:35.689 --> 04:34:35.699 align:start position:0%
there's a tremendous amount of power and
 
04:34:38.510 --> 04:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
information and we're given up
 
04:34:41.269 --> 04:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
the way this is the trajectory of this
 
04:34:43.609 --> 04:34:43.619 align:start position:0%
we're given up a tremendous amount of
 
04:34:46.369 --> 04:34:46.379 align:start position:0%
insight into our personal lives with
 
04:34:48.830 --> 04:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
this interconnection as I understand the
 
04:34:51.769 --> 04:34:51.779 align:start position:0%
interconnection and and there has not
 
04:34:55.250 --> 04:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
been any legislative oversight of the
 
04:34:57.230 --> 04:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
closed-loop referral system and how it's
 
04:34:59.810 --> 04:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
going to interconnect and Network
 
04:35:02.929 --> 04:35:02.939 align:start position:0%
and so to your your specific question I
 
04:35:06.170 --> 04:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
I don't have an answer for you I I I'd
 
04:35:09.109 --> 04:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
kind of like to get it into hb2 so that
 
04:35:12.590 --> 04:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
the Senate sees it so the Senate talks
 
04:35:14.810 --> 04:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
about it so so I could take your
 
04:35:17.990 --> 04:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
question to them and and get a refined
 
04:35:22.310 --> 04:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
and resolved but I I I'm a I'm a privacy
 
04:35:25.970 --> 04:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
Advocate and I just do not like that
 
04:35:29.150 --> 04:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
we're going willy nilly down a very fast
 
04:35:31.670 --> 04:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
slope towards the end of personal
 
04:35:35.929 --> 04:35:35.939 align:start position:0%
privacy by having the the one system
 
04:35:39.349 --> 04:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
connect the entire network together on
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
your master client index I just we need
 
04:35:45.410 --> 04:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
to be very careful we have a duty to
 
04:35:49.330 --> 04:35:49.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:54.959 --> 04:35:58.970 align:start position:0%
 
bye

04:35:58.970 --> 04:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:00.769 --> 04:36:00.779 align:start position:0%
well what we're doing here today really
 
04:36:03.949 --> 04:36:03.959 align:start position:0%
concerns me because I I do believe that
 
04:36:06.410 --> 04:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
this issue has been before one of our
 
04:36:07.910 --> 04:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
policy committees
 
04:36:09.949 --> 04:36:09.959 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:36:13.070 --> 04:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
um they have had a robust discussion of
 
04:36:13.080 --> 04:36:13.849 align:start position:0%
um they have had a robust discussion of
this

04:36:13.849 --> 04:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:36:16.849 --> 04:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
and they have a report coming out and
 
04:36:19.849 --> 04:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
actually The Minority Report asked for
 
04:36:22.310 --> 04:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
an amendment that is very similar
 
04:36:25.490 --> 04:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
to what we are seeing before us now and
 
04:36:27.470 --> 04:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
I think we're trying to do a in run
 
04:36:30.170 --> 04:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
around one of our policy committees and
 
04:36:32.869 --> 04:36:32.879 align:start position:0%
I think that Finance should not be doing
 
04:36:34.849 --> 04:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
that and
 
04:36:37.670 --> 04:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
um I will certainly be voting no on this
 
04:36:37.680 --> 04:36:39.590 align:start position:0%
um I will certainly be voting no on this
amendment

04:36:39.590 --> 04:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:36:42.051 --> 04:36:42.061 align:start position:0%

04:36:44.689 --> 04:36:44.699 align:start position:0%
want to remind uh representative Wallner
 
04:36:46.910 --> 04:36:46.920 align:start position:0%

04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
of HHS and with representative saloway
 
04:36:54.769 --> 04:36:54.779 align:start position:0%
from HHS and they all agree that this
 
04:36:56.990 --> 04:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
has not been the subject of one of their
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%

04:43:33.708 --> 04:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
will be you're welcome
 
04:43:35.208 --> 04:43:35.218 align:start position:0%
um at this point
 
04:43:37.970 --> 04:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
we may be doing it here in the chamber
 
04:43:41.030 --> 04:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure at this point we'll have to
 
04:43:44.390 --> 04:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
be talking to the the leadership but my
 
04:43:45.890 --> 04:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
presumption would be that we likely
 
04:43:49.490 --> 04:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
would have this session in here on
 
04:43:52.070 --> 04:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
next Monday the 5th when we present to
 
04:43:53.390 --> 04:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
the Full House
 
04:43:54.890 --> 04:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
and there may be a number of people that
 
04:43:57.590 --> 04:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
want to attend in person so
 
04:43:59.330 --> 04:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
we'll be ready to
 
04:44:01.128 --> 04:44:01.138 align:start position:0%
speak to them as well
 
04:44:04.250 --> 04:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
so I thank you all for all the
 
04:44:06.708 --> 04:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
dedication and work this is the toughest
 
04:44:08.930 --> 04:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
committee to be on in the house during
 
04:44:11.270 --> 04:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
budget period we'll have a little bit of
 
04:44:13.490 --> 04:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
rest next year maybe we won't be quite
 
04:44:15.350 --> 04:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
so busy but
 
04:44:18.350 --> 04:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
we'll have made up for it so I thank you
 
04:44:21.170 --> 04:44:21.180 align:start position:0%

04:44:23.810 --> 04:44:23.820 align:start position:0%
comments and your questions because
 
04:44:26.448 --> 04:44:26.458 align:start position:0%
that's the way it works so
 
04:44:28.490 --> 04:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
they're all working together
 
04:44:31.610 --> 04:44:31.620 align:start position:0%
as always we may have disagreements but
 
04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
we'll do our best to find common ground
 
04:44:36.730 --> 04:44:36.740 align:start position:0%
