88
 
00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 align:start position:0%
due to a time commitment
 
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
and the prime sponsor 1288 wasn't able
 
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
to be with us last week

house bill 1288 cleaned started just to

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
inadvertently left out of a bill last
 
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.189 align:start position:0%
inadvertently left out of a bill last
year

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
and while edna had it we added at the
 
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
request of the commissioner
 
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.710 align:start position:0%
request of the commissioner
some

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.150 align:start position:0%
some
minor

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
minor
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
rearrangement of titles and
 
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
and we added
 
00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
we increase the amount of the
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner arlinghaus explained it to
 
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
the committee the only detail that i
 
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
remember clearly is that this fund used
 
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
and half from the general fund so it
 
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
however that was stopped it's now
 
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
entirely funded from agency funds for
 
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%
training their people and therefore the
 
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
amount should be larger
 
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
because there is no general funds in it
 
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.390 align:start position:0%
because there is no general funds in it
and

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
and of course there's always inflation
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that to deal with and if
 
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
you have questions about the amount of
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
the fund
 
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
i have commissioner arlinghus here to
 
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
answer them
 
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.150 align:start position:0%
answer them

commissioners here just in case
 
00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
you don't know this what happened when
 
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
the divisions what happened to dedicated
 
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.830 align:start position:0%

funds

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 align:start position:0%
this was the only fund that was affected
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
we didn't no no no i'm sorry i don't
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
funds they used to be in
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry we didn't go into that and i'm
 
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
any further questions if not
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
if the commissioner
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%

arlinghaus

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
arlinghaus
 
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
of canterbury i guess we do towns
 
00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
from the department of administrative
 
00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:10.550 align:start position:0%
from the department of administrative
services

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
the dedicated funds question um
 
00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
nothing's happened to dedicated funds
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
all right so we so it's important to
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
note this nothing's actually being
 
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
reorganized the title of one of the
 
00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
divisions is changing
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
the division that we used to call
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
financial data management because they
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
just did not just the financial side you
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
know if you think of the erp it's
 
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
multiple modules the state computer
 
00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:34.469 align:start position:0%
multiple modules the state computer
system

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
and so what they do is not really manage
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
financial data they manage the whole
 
00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
kit and caboodle and so whole kit and
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
caboodle didn't sound that official so
 
00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:43.749 align:start position:0%
caboodle didn't sound that official so
it's

00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
so we worked the word enterprise in so
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's actually literally the only
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
reorder that happened
 
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
but i just just want to make sure i
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
understand so
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh when we want to find dedicated the
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds reporting from now on it
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
will be under the division of enterprise
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
applications management
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh typically in our operation as
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
accounting services dana calls the
 
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
comptroller and uh and matt johnson
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
who's the new tim hartshorn on her staff
 
00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
are typically who do all of that work
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
and i think we we put the dedicated
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
funds report on that division's
 
00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:19.749 align:start position:0%
funds report on that division's
website

accounting services accounting services
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
yes it's really hard to find
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
are you all set representative yes thank
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
you uh representative romney
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you uh mr
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
arlinghaus uh just want to make sure no
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
general funds in this this is
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
self-feeding from
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
what feeds it what kind of things so the
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
so the bureau of education and training
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
which is part of dop uh division of
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
personnel um used to be funded 50
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
general funds and 50 tuition payments
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
which comes from agencies so it could
 
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
easily be general funds uh agencies and
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
cities and towns
 
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
in the last phase the governor's budget
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
director in the last budget process
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
said that we could either eliminate it
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
or make it entirely self-funded through
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
tuition payments and so it's funded
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
through tuition payments it's why we
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
want to retain the tuition payments that
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
cross the fiscal year line
 
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.949 align:start position:0%
cross the fiscal year line
um

00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
and so the lion's share of it comes from
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
agency funds and they could be general
 
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
funds but when we get them they stop
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
being general funds and that's the
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
reason for raising a hundred thousand
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so um when it when you're 50
 
00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:31.519 align:start position:0%
generally funded you know i don't want
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
for the year you know you you some of
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
the money goes away it's just not a big
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
deal but when when you have to eat what
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
you kill so to speak um
 
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
we need to roll it over
 
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
that explains it thank you thank you
 
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner thank you for
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any information they'd
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
like to share with the committee
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%

and that was included
 
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:04.720 align:start position:0%

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.509 align:start position:0%
um which is a different cut at this
their

00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
their estimates
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
came in at 50 this is a work such as
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
only a little more right right this is a
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
work session so
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
their estimates originally came in
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
around 50 million ish on the average
 
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.749 align:start position:0%
around 50 million ish on the average
um

00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
the marijuana commission number came in
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
about the same
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
about 50 million
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
we have another document that was handed
 
00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.790 align:start position:0%
we have another document that was handed
out

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
from another bill
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh 2 237 which was a full
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
commercialization bill
 
00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.269 align:start position:0%
commercialization bill
that

00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
we gotta add two numbers it was they
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
that bill called for taxation at the
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
wholesale level at the at the grower
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
level and then taxation at the retail
 
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.870 align:start position:0%
level and then taxation at the retail
level

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
so when you add the two together it was
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
around uh 20 million
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
to call it 35 million
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
and that's that and and this all depends
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
on what tax rate you want to use and
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
these were based at pretty low tax rates
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
and i think and this was randy cushing's
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
bill uh wrapped up
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
delayed running cushing and
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
he i think in this bill he purposely
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
picked low rates um
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
of taxation so that that's the range
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
that was that we are so
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
so we're in the ballpark somewhere in
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
in the 40 million to 50 million maybe 60
 
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.190 align:start position:0%
in the 40 million to 50 million maybe 60
million

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:51.990 align:start position:0%
million
but

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know every any way you look at this
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
there's different cuts at this
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not 200 million
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
okay it's not 300 300 million in terms
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
of the net
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
and all the numbers that is quoted
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
included edibles your numbers included
 
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.950 align:start position:0%
included edibles your numbers included
edibles

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
edibles
 
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.669 align:start position:0%
edibles
now

00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
the new piece of information um is this
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
document and i'm going to look at you
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
tina and help us out
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
with this it's in your folders
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
i was doing some further research and
 
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.270 align:start position:0%
i was doing some further research and
found

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
found
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
the institute on taxation and economic
 
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.710 align:start position:0%
the institute on taxation and economic
policy

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.510 align:start position:0%
policy
and

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
in reviewing this
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
found that the numbers support the 50
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
million that we were originally looking
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
at so if you look at the first map where
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
it talks in new hampshire it's giving
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
you a projection of what new hampshire
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
would look like
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
based on the
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
washington model and the protection
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
these numbers were back from 2019 so if
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
you look at the sheet that we provided
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
previously in our fiscal note you'll see
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
that washington
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
came in
 
00:18:56.559 --> 00:18:57.990 align:start position:0%
came in
um

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's on the second
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
which page was it on the second page on
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
the bottom washington um came in at 480
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
and the projections that we had before
 
00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.870 align:start position:0%
and the projections that we had before
were

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
right in line so we were just using this
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
as for further support to show how we
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
originally did our estimates on a per
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
capita basis to how the institute was
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the taxation per state
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
and that was with edibles correct
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
and our bill
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
does not have edibles but only
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
edibles associated with medical
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee reps and
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
allow me
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you on this itap sheet
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
is in your state
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
were these done before they started
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
getting their data in
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
um this was from 2019 yeah
 
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
so even though they said could they were
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
basing it on what they'd already seen
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
okay and you said it was representative
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
39 taxation rate which is pretty high
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
actually yes
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
so so this would be kind of a really
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
high number
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
using their model correct that's why the
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
number's 71 million versus the 50 that
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
we were looking at which was around the
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
20 percent okay
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
mr chair can i
 
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.070 align:start position:0%
mr chair can i
go

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
continue okay so that that's that's the
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
revenue there's more discussion we'll
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
have more discussion on revenues as we
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
go on here today
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
um because that's the whole
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
i mean main the main enchilada in our
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
discussions is what what's what's the
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
revenue going to be um
 
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.510 align:start position:0%
revenue going to be um
so

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
just for the since you hear uh
 
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.710 align:start position:0%
just for the since you hear uh
commissioner

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh you envision just just give the
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
committee a sense of what you envision
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of stores and their locations
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
and their uh they're going to be
 
00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:03.830 align:start position:0%
and their uh they're going to be
storefronts

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
storefronts
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
sure i thank you
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
well what we'd like to see first and
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
foremost i'd like to to reiterate and
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
reinforce that the liquor commission is
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill and
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
we were asked to do a fiscal note and we
 
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
did a fiscal note to the best of our
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
ability obviously we run an 800 million
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
dollar business we know a little bit
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
about retail and profits and enforcement
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
quite frankly we're happy that we had
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to do it
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
what i would like to see is a separate
 
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.669 align:start position:0%
what i would like to see is a separate
branding

00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
branding
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
a separate uh freestanding store i don't
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
think that this
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know originally this was
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
there was some talk of this being in the
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
liquor stores we never felt that that
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
was a good idea these should be uh
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
separately branded in stores that are
 
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.549 align:start position:0%
separately branded in stores that are
separate

00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
we would follow our model because our
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
model works well we would
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
place the stores
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
with like-minded retailers
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
and retailers of volume
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
obviously fifty percent of our business
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
in our
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh retail liquor sales comes from
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
cross-border we would expect to have the
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
lowest prices in new england because
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
there would not be a tax structure tied
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
to it like there is in many other states
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
and in massachusetts for instance the
 
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
exides tax on cannabis overtook the
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
excise tax in liquor in year two
 
00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.110 align:start position:0%
excise tax in liquor in year two
so

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
there's no uh mistaking that
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is successful
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
and their
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
their tax revenue shows it
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
we would we would run our stores for
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
lack of a better way to put it we'd run
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
it much like a jewelry store you'd go
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
into a store there'd be a small space
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
probably nothing larger than 3 500 or 4
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
000 square feet including the back room
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
everything would be put in cases there
 
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be anything out for people to
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
come in contact with so you're going
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
into uh you know okay jewelers or any
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
jewelry store things are in cases the
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
product is in the cases
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
the employees would need to
 
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
come up to speed as far as education and
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
sales are concerned of the product
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
part of our
 
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
repertoire that we had asked for would
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
to be included would be a negociant much
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
like in the wine business there's wine
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
negotiates they educate uh they educate
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
the consumers they educate the people
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
that work in the stores to the product
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
how the product is sold the effects of
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
the product we feel that that would be a
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
good model for us to follow because
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
obviously we're successful retailers and
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
and we do a large amount of volume but
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
we're not in the cannabis business so
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
we'd want to be brought up to speed on
 
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.390 align:start position:0%
we'd want to be brought up to speed on
that

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
and we'd like to place the stores
 
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.230 align:start position:0%
and we'd like to place the stores
uh

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
on the borders to
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
be quite frank about it uh we we want to
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
that's 10 stores would take a period of
 
00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.909 align:start position:0%
that's 10 stores would take a period of
time

00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
uh we were asked to do 10 we thought 10
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
would be the best way it could be more
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
stores in the future
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
but the the model of uh
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
as we've spoken to this morning the
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
in agreement with that and uh
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
i don't know what else i can i i can add
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
so representative romney talking about
 
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
the stores so in the bill
 
00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.710 align:start position:0%
the stores so in the bill
as

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
it came to us
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
is uh opt
 
00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.269 align:start position:0%
is uh opt
out

00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
clause for the uh towns
 
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.789 align:start position:0%
clause for the uh towns
now

00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
many towns are going to miss that opt
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
out first off
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
you know um and talking to the municipal
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
they think it'd be better if it was an
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
opt-in but that's
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
another discussion
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
i just want to ask you when it comes to
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
your liquor stores
 
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
do you have any of their provisions
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
where a town has a say whether we place
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
this liquor store in their town or not
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
or city
 
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:03.750 align:start position:0%
or city
no

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
all right there's so this will be a
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
little bit different than that so
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
so there's no restriction on the liquor
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
part of the what they of their business
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
but in this bill we're allowing towns to
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
say no we don't want a cannabis store or
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
any any cannabis operation whether it's
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
growing or manufacturing or retail
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
so that's just something for the
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
committee to keep in mind
 
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
that there may be some towns that are
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
just going to
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
opt out
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
of it so i just wanted to
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
well you were here to ask you that
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
question about i had there was one in
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
the back of my mind i mean they asked
 
00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
somebody about that
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
so you have no problem with the liquor
 
00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.430 align:start position:0%
so you have no problem with the liquor
store

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
store
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
liquor liquor placement
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
do you think
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
do you think it'll be harder for you
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
to place to
 
00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.590 align:start position:0%
to place to
get

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
strip malls or whatever
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
to agree
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
store fronts
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
turned into stores to sell cannabis than
 
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.390 align:start position:0%
turned into stores to sell cannabis than
liquor

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
if we were looking at this five years
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
ago i'd say yes it probably would have
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
been but i think in you know in today's
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
world in today's retail world this is
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
certainly something that's become much
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
more acceptable obviously we're the only
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
state we're kind of an island we're the
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
only state that doesn't do it
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
everybody around us does
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
and uh i know that maine has a different
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
model uh the towns actually
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh individually charge for licenses of
 
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.350 align:start position:0%
uh individually charge for licenses of
retail

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
retail
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
and some towns are very high and some
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
towns are much less so i think there
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for the towns here if
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
they wanted to do an individual type of
 
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.470 align:start position:0%
they wanted to do an individual type of
license

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
and charge the state
 
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
there might be
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
there might be some sort of
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
incentive for the towns to be able to do
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
that but i don't think in today's retail
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
market i think it's much more acceptable
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
i think the consumers are much more
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
accepting of it
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
and my my biggest thing
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
originally with this and looking at it
 
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
is i didn't want to cross lines between
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
our liquor consumers
 
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
and our cannabis consumers because there
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
are certainly folks that come into our
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
liquor stores now
 
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.669 align:start position:0%
liquor stores now
that

00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
would be turned off by it and we have a
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
lot of obviously in the highway we have
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of families that come into our
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
stores we have people that come through
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know they buy they buy their
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
children a hot chocolate out front and
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
and they get a sandwich and then they
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
come into our liquor store as a family
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
and i'd we wouldn't want obviously to
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
turn anybody off by doing that so i
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
think having the stores separate is key
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
and as far as the towns are concerned i
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
mean we would abide by whatever the
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
towns wanted
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
obviously we're we're not in the
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
business to be contentious in any way
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
either with our stores or with with
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
these potential cannabis stores
 
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
and we're at the point now with our
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
brand and our model where uh we have
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
more towns than juanas than not so i'm
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
hoping that in the future that we would
 
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
see the same with
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
this i have one i have one more question
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
oh let's
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
i can i can hold my question
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
you want me to ask it
 
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.029 align:start position:0%
you want me to ask it
okay

00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
so talking about
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
cross-border sales
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
obviously it's illegal to
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
buy marijuana in new hampshire and take
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
it back to massachusetts understood
 
00:28:40.399 --> 00:28:41.830 align:start position:0%
it back to massachusetts understood
so

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
i would imagine that would curtail it
 
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a good look
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
i don't put words in your mouth but it
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a good look for new
 
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire to be advertising in in uh
 
00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.950 align:start position:0%
hampshire to be advertising in in uh
massachusetts

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
the way you do for liquor because liquor
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
is legal
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
can you just speak to that real quick
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
as far as the advertising campaign and
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
what we would do that wouldn't be part
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
of our campaign and it certainly
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be something that takes place
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
as far as an advertising is concerned uh
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
but you know i drive down the mass pike
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
as anyone else does and uh i'm you're
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
inundated with billboards pretty much
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
throughout new england as to cannabis
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
being sold in whatever state you're in
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
obviously other than new hampshire and
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
if you visit any of the stores in
 
00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:30.789 align:start position:0%
if you visit any of the stores in
massachusetts

00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
or maine
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
much like our stores have a lot of
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
out-of-state plates those locations have
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of out-of-state plates as well so
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
as far as the law is concerned i'm
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
certainly sure that we're going to abide
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
by the letter of the law however
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
i think there's some personal rights
 
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
involved here that we would you know you
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
don't go out and check license plates at
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
liquor stores and i think this would be
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
the same and it would be difficult to do
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh at cannabis stores
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
i would agree with you on that
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
it's just going to happen yeah
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
i beg your pardon representative aims
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
put on your microphone oh sorry i'll
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
start over
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you let's see if this works okay
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
um much better much better
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
okay i'll start over you're working with
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
a wholesale market in liquor
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
that is worldwide
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
and highly varied in terms of uh
 
00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh offerings of product yeah and
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
that's what you're used to working with
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
you're very adept
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
at finding a good product
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
that will work in terms of the market
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
you're trying to market to and selling
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
that product
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
and making
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
a good
 
00:31:13.519 --> 00:31:15.110 align:start position:0%
a good
profit

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
profit
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
we do our best thank you well we
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:19.909 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
um

00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about cannabis
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
and as per the discussion a moment ago
 
00:31:26.399 --> 00:31:27.269 align:start position:0%
and as per the discussion a moment ago
uh

00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
essentially your
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
wholesale market
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
your product market
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
is confined to confined to
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:31:38.399 --> 00:31:39.990 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
uh

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
very very different it's also not as
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
varied a product
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
i mean surely there are attempts to
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
create variety to attract
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
consumers to establish niches and so
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
forth but uh
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's really
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
very different from what you're used to
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
how do you see that affecting
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
to become the sort of the premier the
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
place to go to
 
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
for buying cannabis
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
well i think one of the things that we
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
looked at and one of the things that we
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
thought about was
 
00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:20.799 align:start position:0%
you know obviously
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
has been forever known as an
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
agricultural state
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of family farms
 
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
small farms
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh one acre two acre
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
and some of these facilities that i've
 
00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
personally visited in maine are not much
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
more than that and producing a large
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
amount of cannabis
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
i believe there's uh
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
650 growers in the state of maine now
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
and they cannot keep up with the amount
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
of cannabis that's being sold
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that i
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
when i one of the things that i think
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
if if we decide if you decide to get
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
involved in this business
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
is this is this could be an agricultural
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
windfall for the state of new hampshire
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
this could be an agricultural windfall
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
for all these small farms and small
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
family plots that could get licensed and
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
could sell now could they could have one
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
crop a year or they could have five
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
crops a year depending on how much money
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
they want to put into it but rather than
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
selling or along with selling some
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
tomatoes and cucumbers and pumpkins out
 
00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:27.750 align:start position:0%
tomatoes and cucumbers and pumpkins out
front

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
front
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
this could this could turn into
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
a real windfall that for these folks
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
that in some respects have suffered over
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
the years
 
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
so i i don't see
 
00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.430 align:start position:0%
so i i don't see
it

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.389 align:start position:0%
it
being

00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
i actually see it being
 
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.149 align:start position:0%
i actually see it being
uh

00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
an enhancement and and something that
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
could help people in the state and i
 
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
think that there would be a lot more
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
people that are willing to grow
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
than we might think
 
00:33:54.559 --> 00:33:59.750 align:start position:0%
than we might think
okay

00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
i agree i agree agree with that
 
00:34:01.679 --> 00:34:03.509 align:start position:0%
i agree i agree agree with that
sentiment

00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
sentiment
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
the bill has a limit to cultivator
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
licenses right now of 15.
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to you no it does
 
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.310 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to you no it does
not

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
i think that would be a mistake
 
00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.589 align:start position:0%
i think that would be a mistake
yeah

00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:16.629 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.069 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:22.869 align:start position:0%
uh
so

00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
the model that you've built on us
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
actually not
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.030 align:start position:0%
in this
legislation

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
in contrast in massachusetts they've got
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
more than 350
 
00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:47.270 align:start position:0%
more than 350
retail

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
retail
 
00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.470 align:start position:0%
retail
outlets

00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
outlets
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
in uh maine they've got about 75 i think
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
vermont's just starting so we don't know
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
but lots lots of places to go to
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
all over those states
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
4 10 is
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
is very very different it's consistent
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
with the liquor
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
approach although i don't know exactly
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
how many outlets you have
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh but just under 70 and we're opening
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
three new ones at this point so we just
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
at 70. yeah okay
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
at one point we didn't have 80.
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
so is this going to work
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
with 10 stores
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
i think that that 10 stores
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative is was a was a starting
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
point for us i think that they'll in the
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
future need to be more stores i think
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
that uh depending on the model and the
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
financing model that comes out of this
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh we'll we'll be able to look
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
at that and and make our decisions but i
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
think 10 stores is
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for us to get into the
 
00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.470 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for us to get into the
business

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
and and be competitive and be highly
 
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.230 align:start position:0%
and and be competitive and be highly
competitive

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
and then look at
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
future offerings as the public demands
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
it and and and much like in the liquor
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
business uh you know consumers tell us
 
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.270 align:start position:0%
business uh you know consumers tell us
where

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
they want our stores to be for the most
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
part i mean obviously with like-minded
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
retailers of market baskets and shaws
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
and hannafords and
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
you know i think that the consumers will
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
will let us know we're going to part of
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
our model would be to strategically
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
place them throughout the state
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
all over the state the original 10 and
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
then fill in as we as we go along and
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
depending on the model of financing
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
obviously the more money that we can
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
roll back into the business the more
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
stores we can add and the success would
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
be greater
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
just one more follow-up sorry follow-up
 
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.710 align:start position:0%
just one more follow-up sorry follow-up
uh

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
if we start at that level it makes sense
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
to start small oh this is new
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
would that affect
 
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.670 align:start position:0%
would that affect
our

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
revenues in other words we
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
we're gonna start low um as we're gonna
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
have to finance that startup because you
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
know we don't
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
you know it's your stores it's the
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
state's stores and we're going to have
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
so we start small
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
with 10
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
that suggests to me that we
 
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
if we anticipate a revenue level up here
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
say 70 million dollars
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get there for a while
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
i think that that would take a period of
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
time and you know anyone that knows me
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
or knows tina knows that we're very
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
conservative in our numbers i'd rather
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh surprise you with success than
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
disappoint you with failure
 
00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:45.589 align:start position:0%
disappoint you with failure
so

00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
that's how we're that's how we're
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
looking at this and that's how we look
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
at everything that we do i appreciate
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you representative
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative news followed by
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chairman
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner thank you both
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
for being here today uh we are very
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
anxious to hear more from you today um i
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
just have a clarifying question
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
you talked about a monetary incentive
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
for towns
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
for is this monetary for retail startup
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
to the towns or is this uh about revenue
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
generated in the towns because the
 
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
stores would be there can you elaborate
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
on what you meant by that sure
 
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
i think there would be a little bit of
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
both but i i know that some of the
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
states have a model of buy town if the
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
towns choose to allow it there's a
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
benefit to them because they would give
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
the retailer the the liquor commission
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
the state a license to operate in that
 
00:38:38.079 --> 00:38:38.870 align:start position:0%
the state a license to operate in that
town

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
so there's the incentive for the town to
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
not opt out
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
so and in in some towns i've known it to
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
be as high as 50 000
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
and in some towns i've known it to be as
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
low as 2500
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
depending on the town in the state so
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:03.990 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
i'm afraid i don't have the benefit of
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
having been in the group that was
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
was figuring out questions uh
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
but the first one is you'd in the fiscal
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
note put your expenses in doing this
 
00:39:19.839 --> 00:39:20.790 align:start position:0%
note put your expenses in doing this
uh

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.710 align:start position:0%
uh
and

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
on do you still stand by those same ones
 
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.870 align:start position:0%
on do you still stand by those same ones
or

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
would you be revising them and you're
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
the startup costs and then the
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
we'd stand by
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
as i said as we've said representative
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
we we tend to be conservative in that
 
00:39:51.119 --> 00:39:52.069 align:start position:0%
we we tend to be conservative in that
approach

00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh i think that the numbers that we
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
looked at per square footage of
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
developing these stores and developing
 
00:39:59.829 --> 00:39:59.839 align:start position:0%
this brand
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
i know that we had asked for some
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
additional money to advertise
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh if if that's not the uh
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
if that's not the wish of the committee
 
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
then we look at it differently and we
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
and we move forward accordingly
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
well i i've got a couple of separate
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
questions but could i have a follow-up
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
to that follow-up
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
i understood that it would be illegal to
 
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.870 align:start position:0%
i understood that it would be illegal to
advertise

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
advertise
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
because the feds
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
might come down on that
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
are they
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
but they are advertising it sounds like
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
in in their the other states yes
 
00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.630 align:start position:0%
in in their the other states yes
so

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
i mean it's amazing to take a ride out
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
the mass pike quite frankly when you
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
when you get beyond when you get beyond
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
uh worcester and and
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
and even some spots between boston and
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
and worcester and framingham but the
 
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
billboards are incredible the amount of
 
00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
money that the state of massachusetts is
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
spending to advertise cannabis i i don't
 
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
know what the actual number is but it's
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
got to be a staggering number those
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
billboards are not cheap
 
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:10.790 align:start position:0%
thank you and
and

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
the second
 
00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.230 align:start position:0%
the second
question

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.829 align:start position:0%
question
is

00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
first you said that
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
the 10 stores were only going to be on
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
the borders to out-compete our neighbors
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
which leaves the entire interior of the
 
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.390 align:start position:0%
which leaves the entire interior of the
state

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
unserved when an awful lot of them are
 
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
trying to get
 
00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.470 align:start position:0%
trying to get
access

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
well i think one of the things we looked
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
at was
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
obviously we don't want any community or
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
any part of the state to go unserved
 
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
should you decide to do this
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
and we would look at that
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
when i say on the borders i don't mean
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily on the border of west
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
lebanon or
 
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
on the border of of you know in salem i
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
mean where consumers can get to the
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
stores and they're
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
associated with other retailers so
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
do i see some
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
being in border towns rochester

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i do
 
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.349 align:start position:0%
yeah i do
because

00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
there are two towns right we fish where
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
the fish are just
 
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
did you have another question yes i did
 
00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.430 align:start position:0%
did you have another question yes i did
um

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
and this one
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay i'll remember that i hope
 
00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.550 align:start position:0%
okay i'll remember that i hope
uh

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
this other one on
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
i'm really concerned about
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
on in my experience what and i
 
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
i don't smoke marijuana i can't get
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
anything out of smoking marijuana and so
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
it was easy to make that decision a long
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
time ago
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
but i do know that the people who do
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
smoke marijuana
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
care deeply about the quality of it
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's not as
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
simple thing to grow marijuana and keep
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
it consistent
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
in quality
 
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.710 align:start position:0%
in quality
and

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
most i think most of the places that are
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
growing it are growing it in factory
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
farms essentially
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
they're growing it inside under
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
controlled conditions with controlled
 
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
soil and et cetera et cetera and then
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
they have a product that they
 
00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:35.910 align:start position:0%
they have a product that they
they

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
more or less guarantee
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh if we go to
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
doing it on people's back lots
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of different people
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
well i think just like any market
 
00:43:53.599 --> 00:43:54.470 align:start position:0%
well i think just like any market
the

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
the market
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
tells you what the quality should be and
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
obviously the quantity of growers should
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
be but i certainly from a from a
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
business perspective
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
don't feel that limiting the amount of
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
licenses is the right thing to do
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
because then we're only serving the few
 
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
i think that the piece that we had put
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
in put in there
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
to have a negociant someone who has the
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
expertise in the field to go out
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
to investigate what's being grown how
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's being grown where it's being grown
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
and bring us the product that they feel
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
that we should have
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
that's that was the mindset behind that
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
wording and that position
 
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
we're not experts in this field but
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
there's many people that are and i think
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
that this would be a highly sought after
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think i understand what a
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
negociant is then i thought it was
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
somebody in the store who was helping
 
00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.550 align:start position:0%
somebody in the store who was helping
people

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
pick among different things there but
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
someone who would have to go out to all
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the little farms that you're talking
 
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.309 align:start position:0%
of the little farms that you're talking
about

00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
and at various times during the season
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
and the harvesting
 
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.589 align:start position:0%
and the harvesting
uh

00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:11.599 --> 00:45:12.470 align:start position:0%
uh
to

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
see how they're doing it
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
would be quite a different proposition
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
well i i we we called the position in
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
the negotiate i'm not sure if you
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
changed the wording of of what that
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
position actually was but in the wine
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
world the negotiator goes to the
 
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.390 align:start position:0%
world the negotiator goes to the
vineyards

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
vineyards
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
and tries looks at the grapes looks at
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
the vines the health of the vines the
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
health of of the product the soil the
 
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.349 align:start position:0%
health of of the product the soil the
terroir

00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
terroir
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
goes and tastes the wine
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
and makes
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know discoverable images of the
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
wine it's earthy it's green it's
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
it is what it is this is the type of
 
00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
person that we would need to have to go
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
to do the same thing to look at the
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
flower to look at the plants to see how
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's grown to test it the thc levels etc
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not an expert in it and that's why i
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
think that there's
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
there's people out there and we we asked
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
for one as a startup
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
you you may end up with more than one
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
and you may end up in a situation where
 
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
it's regional but these folks would go
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
out and work with these folks who are
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
growers to tell them what first and
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
foremost what the consumers are looking
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
for we don't want them growing something
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
that consumers aren't looking for so
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to pattern them to we're
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
going to this negotiate would pattern
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
them to say this is what the consumers
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
are looking for this is what they're
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
buying in other states this is what we
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
need you to grow
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
just with respect
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
this is an annual plant
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
00:46:49.599 --> 00:46:51.190 align:start position:0%
it is not
grapevines

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
grapevines
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
no no ma'am
 
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.870 align:start position:0%
no no ma'am
okay

00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
i want to go to some other reps right
 
00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.630 align:start position:0%
i want to go to some other reps right
now

00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
the order is represent aaron followed by
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative nunes and representative
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr chair
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
and thank you so much for coming in and
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
talking to us today
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
my question is about um advertising
 
00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.230 align:start position:0%
my question is about um advertising
and

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
do you foresee that you would use the
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
same sort of advertising strategy that
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
you do for
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
the liquor
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
for liquor and beer wine
 
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
when you do your advertising budget for
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
the liquor outlets
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
do you do that based on um
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
a percentage of
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
how how do you how do you foresee
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
transitioning that kind of model to
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh selling cannabis
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
well i think now
 
00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.190 align:start position:0%
well i think now
that

00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
the ability to advertise is going to be
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
limited when you start i think it really
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
depends on what the federal government
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
chooses to do
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
i think at at some point there may be a
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
a change of heart from the federal
 
00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.390 align:start position:0%
a change of heart from the federal
government

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
is in in looking at how cannabis is
 
00:48:16.079 --> 00:48:17.109 align:start position:0%
is in in looking at how cannabis is
sold

00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
sold
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
and how it's financed and how it's
 
00:48:19.359 --> 00:48:20.470 align:start position:0%
and how it's financed and how it's
advertised

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
advertised
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
and i think that that would be something
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
that we'd have to look at obviously
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
we're not going to we're not going to do
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
anything outside of what we're allowed
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
to do legally
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
so we'd have to look at
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
the revenues and the advertising budget
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
would be based on the revenues
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much you're welcome
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
representative nunes
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
um i i want to make a statement here i
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
think a negociant is
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
like a market consultant
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
someone who's an expertise in in the in
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
that vertical in that area who who knows
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
the business that would go out and and
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
talk with the growers about what their
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
products are about and then would bring
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
that information uh back and make
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
determinations on what type of contracts
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
would be set with these growers correct
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
that's correct i wanted to clarify that
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
just a little bit coming from the
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
consulting world i understand that
 
00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.870 align:start position:0%
consulting world i understand that
um

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
also um
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
you know what i think nope i'm sorry um
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
miss uh representative aaron just asked
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
the other question for advertising that
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
i wanted to ask thank you
 
00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:27.109 align:start position:0%
i wanted to ask thank you
representative

00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:49:31.349 --> 00:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
coming and informing us
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
i noticed in the original
 
00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:34.470 align:start position:0%
i noticed in the original
uh

00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that you didn't want a
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
fourth division
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
for the cannabis enforcement and
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
licensing and i'm wondering if the
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
personnel cost that you might take on at
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
a higher level are included in the
 
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.630 align:start position:0%
a higher level are included in the
estimate

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
of the personnel
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
and if the negotiate which sounds like
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
it might be a expensive position
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
i think that the cost of of
 
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
of doing business in the original uh
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
dollars that we looked for there
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
obviously is going to be some loading
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
costs some load-in costs when you do
 
00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.910 align:start position:0%
costs some load-in costs when you do
this

00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
and we would ask the committee and we'd
 
00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.710 align:start position:0%
and we would ask the committee and we'd
ask

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
ask
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
made whole shall we say
 
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
when they when they open a new division
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a load on our finance
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
division in enforcement division and
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
marketing and so i think there's going
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
to be a period of time
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
that part of those funds would be used
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
to compensate those employees for
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
writing rules for writing job
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
descriptions for doing interviews as
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
well as you know creating office space
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
etc etc so
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
to have a separate division we didn't
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
feel was necessary because all ever we
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
do everything
 
00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:00.309 align:start position:0%
do everything
already

00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
within the confines of our business that
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
this business does our model
 
00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.190 align:start position:0%
this business does our model
was

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
looking at if the federal government
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
ever had an issue
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
with cannabis we'd have everybody who
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
worked on cannabis completely separate
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
from anybody who worked on liquor so the
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
dollars could be accounted for
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
separately the job duties could be
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
accounted for separately
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
the only time that i think you'll see
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
any crossover is in the beginning where
 
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
we're where we're building this in and
 
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
after that this will just be the
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
division the lines that we've drawn in
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
the division will take care of
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
themselves and they'll be separate unto
 
00:51:40.079 --> 00:51:41.510 align:start position:0%
themselves and they'll be separate unto
themselves

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you may i have one more question
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up um in northampton mass
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
where my favorite knitting store is one
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
street over is a dispensary
 
00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
and they always have or had i haven't
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
been down for two years because of covid
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
they always had police in the parking
 
00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:01.109 align:start position:0%
they always had police in the parking
lot

00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
lot
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
is that going to be something we'll need
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
as well i think
 
00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
i think when massachusetts first opened
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
the recreational there was a huge demand
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
i think some of that has waned away as
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
more stores have opened i think in the
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
beginning that's we certainly have an
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement division and they're
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
certainly in tune with uh crowd control
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
and in tune with you know keeping we do
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
it in our stores at the holiday seasons
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
so it's it's it's the same but different
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
we're in the same the same retail
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
environment and uh we we would expect
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
that to happen in the beginning and we
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
have accounted for that as well thank
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you thank you
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative representative murphy
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
followed by representative hatch
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you both for
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
um i was just curious about the comment
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
you made about
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
sound like the mom and pop you know
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
shops the local farms that would be a
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
boon if they could grow some of this
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
product for you
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
and i was initially thinking of this is
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a vertically oriented model
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
whereby you had greenhouses and then you
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
went to produce and then you went to the
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
retail shops
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
does so are you looking at this as a
 
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
hybrid model in a sense where you can
 
00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:17.750 align:start position:0%
hybrid model in a sense where you can
have

00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
local growers come in and then you have
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
your own
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
greenhouses that you would develop your
 
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
own and does that change any way you
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
and have no interest in that the growing
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
end of the business okay that's
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
something that i think that the that the
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
free market should should share in and
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
and obviously profit from as well as the
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
state and from from an i just
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
i've always thought originally from an
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
agricultural standpoint we're a natural
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
for this we have
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
we have the farms we have the space
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
people there's many many thousands of
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
folks out there that are great farmers
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
they they know how to grow and this is
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
right in line with what would serve them
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
best and put some
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
profits in their pockets as well as the
 
00:54:13.359 --> 00:54:14.630 align:start position:0%
profits in their pockets as well as the
towns

00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.319 --> 00:54:29.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for taking my
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
questions and um i'm i'm thinking along
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
i'm here primarily for budgetary
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
concerns and expenditures that are
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
planned or are requested and one area
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
that we're approaching on now is
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement and that's one thing i was
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
curious about you have a very capable
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
group of enforcement officers now you do
 
00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:54.230 align:start position:0%
group of enforcement officers now you do
and

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.030 align:start position:0%
 
in

00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
the need for expansion and if i'm
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
approaching something that's already
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
been discussed completely let me know
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
i would be interested in and i would
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
think there would have to be an
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
expansion of enforcement
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
for marijuana or not this is something i
 
00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.630 align:start position:0%
for marijuana or not this is something i
don't

00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
really know but i would like to see what
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
the plans are how it's being implemented
 
00:55:17.359 --> 00:55:18.309 align:start position:0%
the plans are how it's being implemented
and

00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
how their role in enforcement is going
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
to be expanded in terms of um say
 
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
unauthorized use or things such as that
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
or will local
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities with their officers be
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
involved in and how is that interlinked
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
i just it'd be good to understand that
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
and the cost of that is is my concern
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
well i think in our fiscal note
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
originally we put in additional officers
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
we put in additional enforcement
 
00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.510 align:start position:0%
we put in additional enforcement
personnel

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
00:55:50.309 --> 00:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
and i would as far as our roles with the
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
town i would i would allow the chief to
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
make those decisions on how he would uh
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
administer whatever rules are written
 
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
and working with the towns and
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities but we did ask for
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh additional enforcement personnel
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
in in our original uh
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
annotated i haven't seen that note yet
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
but is that annotated clearly that cost
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note or is it
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
part of the sum or part of the whole i
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
think it's part of the it's summarized
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
as the personnel cost but we do have the
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the positions that we were
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
expecting to include so we could always
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
provide that breaking yeah i would like
 
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:33.990 align:start position:0%
provide that breaking yeah i would like
that

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
if you could thank you thank you
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
representative lyon
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
chair mr jeremy heavier indulgence i
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
have like a series of i'm trying to get
 
00:56:43.829 --> 00:56:43.839 align:start position:0%
to the math of numbers so we have a real
 
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
idea of what we're doing and it may
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
involve a little bit back and forth so
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
if i have a little leeway to have a
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
dialogue rather than just simple
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
questions i appreciate it
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you commissioner thank you for
 
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
taking that question i know we had a
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
conversation earlier out in the hallway
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to kind of summarize some
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
of that conversation is that i think it
 
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
was clear in
 
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
that this is going to be a rolling
 
00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:05.910 align:start position:0%
that this is going to be a rolling
startup

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
startup
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
that obviously we're not going to have
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
10 stores on day one when we snap a
 
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
finger in the law the bill becomes law
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
um and i think we we talked about the
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
idea of having three to four stores per
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
year as a roll-up and then ultimately
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
using the revenue generator from that to
 
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
be able to fund the startup of the rest
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
of the stores so that we don't have to
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
have as much startup costs the full 14
 
00:57:26.559 --> 00:57:27.750 align:start position:0%
have as much startup costs the full 14
million

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:28.549 align:start position:0%
million
um

00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
so if i do my math right and i'm using
 
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
your your cannabis perspective spill
 
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
here is that
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
we know and i think representative
 
00:57:35.359 --> 00:57:36.710 align:start position:0%
we know and i think representative
abrami

00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
abrami
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
said about 40 roughly of the revenue
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
comes from edibles and edibles aren't in
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
this conversation so any of these
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
numbers that we're looking at when we
 
00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:44.799 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh per capita costs or revenues are
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
going to be 60 of what the projection is
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
roughly and to use this as a starting
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
point so as we're using if we if we end
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
50 million dollar revenue net revenue
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
startup start point obviously we we
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
subtract out our
 
00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:03.990 align:start position:0%
subtract out our
40

00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
40
 
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
because we're not selling edibles we're
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
down to 30 million dollars in revenue if
 
00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
all 10 stores were open we were
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
estimating and then we know that in the
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
first year we're only going to have
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
about a third of the stores open so then
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
we got to subtract out make that
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
one-third of that 30 million so we're
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
really looking about 10 million to 10.5
 
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
million dollars first year revenue
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
assuming three stores open for a full
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
calendar year would that be roughly
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
a correct
 
00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh expectation or rough number
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
yes i would agree with that okay so
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
looking at 10.5 million dollar first
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
year expansion and then every year as
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
you open three or four more stores in
 
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
theory that number doubles it goes from
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
10.5 to 20 21 and in the third year
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
comes up to the full whatever the number
 
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
is uh 33 and change that 30 million
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
dollars would that be kind of what we're
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
looking at a three year to get the full
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
projections in that third year we'll
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
start seeing the full revenue of 10
 
00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:57.510 align:start position:0%
start seeing the full revenue of 10
stores

00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
stores
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
that's an accurate timeline i would
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
think and to be clear and i think i'm
 
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
right in the committee there's actually
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
no limitation on the number of stores in
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
this bill the only reason we talked
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
about 10 stores was we needed a gauge
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
for startup costs and so the 14 million
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
dollars we were talking about was okay
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
assuming we did 10 stores this is what
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
the cost would be but there is actually
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
no limitation if i'm correct in the bill
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
for the number of stores you can use
 
00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
your ongoing operating revenues to be
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
able to generate and open more stores
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
past 10 if you feel there's a need is
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
yes so there's a limitation of
 
00:59:29.359 --> 00:59:30.630 align:start position:0%
yes so there's a limitation of
cultivators

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
cultivators
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
only on the grower side that's the only
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
limitation i've already taken a note to
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
amend my amendment to
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
get rid of that so
 
00:59:37.599 --> 00:59:39.270 align:start position:0%
get rid of that so
um

00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry go back to numbers uh
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
so that we've taken care of the revenue
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
side we're estimating the full year of
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
of the first one third of the stores up
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
it's 10.5 million dollars in revenue now
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
to switch over to the cost side so i'm
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
this fiscal note here that had all of
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
the block graphs talking about startup
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
construction everything else and again
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
if i do my math the rough personnel cost
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
for all ten stores was five million
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
dollars if all stores were running the
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
personnel cost is five million dollars
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
but we're actually looking at a revenue
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
expectation of one point i mean a
 
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
revenue cost because again if we ramp up
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
the personnel along with the
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
the stores it's about 1.65 million per
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
year and that number will grow until you
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
get to the third year and have all 10
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
stores open and we'll be at a full
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
um five million dollar personnel roughly
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not trying to yeah well the only
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
thing i would say about that is the
 
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
structure of the personnel was to start
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
up the office like the headquarters to
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
have the enforcement people the finance
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
people the hr
 
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
and then adding in store personnel so
 
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
there might be more of an upfront cost
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
in the personnel with the breakdown that
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
we have of the positions that we were
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
okay so i guess i'm just trying to get
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
to what the what out of the revenue what
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
are we going to actually spend in that
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
first year assuming you know the first
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
full operational year so i i
 
01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
on a per store basis it looks like we're
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
looking at an annual cost of around
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
350 000 per store is that right i think
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
that was where i found the number was
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
350 000 per store is the operational
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
expense for a store
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
and then we have the personnel cost of
 
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
1.6 million on top of that and that's
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
going to grow as both the operational
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
costs and the and the personnel costs
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
will grow
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
you know linearly
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
in theory right we'll use that for
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
modeling so again we're looking at in
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
the first year if you would open three
 
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
stores it's a roughly 1.3 million
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
dollars in operational expenses for the
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
stores and then roughly 1.6 million
 
01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.589 align:start position:0%
stores and then roughly 1.6 million
dollars

01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
we'll call it 2 million because i know
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
the personnel aren't linear so you got
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
to have some people in place like hr
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
before you hire store staff so i will
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
say it it's two million dollars in the
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
first year so we're looking at 1.6
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
million dollars in operating expenses
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
for the first year to get the first
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
store up or first sets of stores up
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
roughly so we have numbers
 
01:02:02.559 --> 01:02:03.430 align:start position:0%
roughly so we have numbers
great

01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
last thing i just want to comment on it
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
was something i just made note we talk
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
about law enforcement and enforcement
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
and it's true that um all of your liquor
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
inspectors are certified full-time
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
police officers in new hampshire police
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
standard training they've already had
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
the drug training and what's legal
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
what's not legal and and those kind of
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
things already so it's just a matter of
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
hiring another full-time police officer
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
and maybe giving some specialized
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
training relative to this specific law
 
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
but uh because it'll be new um but other
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
than that they're already full-time
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
police officers with full-time arrests
 
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
and investigation and
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
detention capabilities correct they're a
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
fully well-rounded police department yes
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
um i think i got the math out of the way
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
i think that took care of most of the
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
items we we know generally what the idea
 
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
is now on revenue you know generally
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
about the ideas on costs and
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
and i can talk to the amendment and some
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
of the things i did to address that and
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
what i talked to finance and got
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
well i have a favor still pending with
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
the chairman i don't have i didn't have
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
a favor with with the chairman of
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
finance but i did get some commitments
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
from her that we can talk about
 
01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
all right that was going to be my
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
question mr chair
 
01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.950 align:start position:0%
question mr chair
okay

01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
uh representative ronnie yeah
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
can we spend a few minutes on that and
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
break the number to everybody we have
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
two fiscal people here in terms of what
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
the chair of finance is willing to
 
01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.750 align:start position:0%
the chair of finance is willing to
absorb

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
absorb
 
01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:24.630 align:start position:0%
absorb
that

01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
for the next fiscal year correct this
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
next fiscal year
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
allocation of 4.6 million is that
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
correct well the gross appropriation
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
will be five million dollars for this
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
bill um because we also have the hundred
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
and fifty thousand dollars that goes to
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
something else and so
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
the chair the the chair of finance told
 
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
christie's office what the legislative
 
01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
budget administrators administration
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
office that to earmark five million
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
dollars for this bill
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay so that's the question and with
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
that in mind
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
can they react to about how many stores
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
can we open the first year with five
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
million i know there's a lot more up
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
front on the overhead positions internal
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
to the operation
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
so that's the kind of number we're
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
working with so i think it's important
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
that you know that
 
01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.349 align:start position:0%
that you know that
um

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
for that first
 
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
just for next fiscal year is that
 
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
correct five million for next fiscal
 
01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.190 align:start position:0%
correct five million for next fiscal
year

01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
and then the anticipation is that after
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
the first store is open that then it'll
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
be self-funding if i may mr chair
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
respond so so again i i
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
the way the bill was reached the way i
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
restructured the bill was
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
initially we had to pay back as the
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
first item
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
out of revenue and i inverted that and i
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
changed the operating expense to the
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
first item so that they can add their
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
new stores in as part of their growth
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
process as part of their operational
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
expense before we start doing it and the
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
secondary item i put was the re um
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
payment of the funds so it gives them a
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
revenue stream to be able to again
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
invest back into themselves to open the
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
next door and open the next door and
 
01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
open the next store um to get to where
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
we're finally you know making decent
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
money to everybody else gets money um
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
so the question is on the five million
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
dollars that
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
gets appropriated can you bring up three
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
stores the first year
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
we feel that we can mr chairman okay
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
so yeah again so representative obama
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
yes the idea is to have them reinvent be
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
able to reinvest some of the funds they
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
get um before
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
we start doing another disbursement so
 
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
we can get to a full model with
 
01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
a decent number of stores that generates
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
enough revenue for everything we want
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay i want to remind the committee
 
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
is that we're going to continue the work
 
01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:41.750 align:start position:0%
is that we're going to continue the work
session

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:42.710 align:start position:0%
session
uh

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
if we can get through the other bills
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
if not we'll continue it in the
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
afternoon and then we'll also continue
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
it again on monday
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
wednesday next week
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
we have to exec it out
 
01:05:58.799 --> 01:05:59.990 align:start position:0%
we have to exec it out
okay

01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
so any further questions of the
 
01:06:01.599 --> 01:06:02.549 align:start position:0%
so any further questions of the
commission

01:06:02.549 --> 01:06:02.559 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:05.589 align:start position:0%
commission
yes

01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.309 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
earlier you mentioned how new hampshire
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
is agricultural and its nature and you
 
01:06:16.109 --> 01:06:16.119 align:start position:0%
use an example of maine having
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
650 growers and 75 stores
 
01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
8.6 grower to store ratio given a sense
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
of supply chain
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
but this new hampshire proposal is
 
01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.150 align:start position:0%
but this new hampshire proposal is
15

01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
15
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
growers for maybe 10 stores maybe more
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
and more stores would only drive that
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
ratio from 1.5 cultivators to
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
storefronts if you want to use that
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
example we're going to have a supply
 
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
chain problem
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
as far as 8.6 growers to stores in maine
 
01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.390 align:start position:0%
as far as 8.6 growers to stores in maine
1.5

01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
1.5
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
growers to store fronts in new hampshire
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
i i think if we limit it to 15
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
that will as i've as i've said i feel
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
that that would be an issue one
 
01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:03.670 align:start position:0%
that that would be an issue one
follow-up

01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:04.789 align:start position:0%
follow-up
follow-up

01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
and that 15 limitation
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
and and to further elaborate on the 15
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
if it if it stays at 15
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that give great preference to
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
the largest possible cultivators and
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
growers and leave out smaller farms i
 
01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
think it would certainly show
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
favoritism that's all thank you bye
 
01:07:29.599 --> 01:07:31.190 align:start position:0%
favoritism that's all thank you bye
congratulations

01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
congratulations
 
01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.630 align:start position:0%
congratulations
representative

01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i think
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
we have to discuss this later
 
01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.270 align:start position:0%
we have to discuss this later
but

01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
small farms
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
that are not growing indoors can only do
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
one to two crops
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
a year at the most
 
01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:49.990 align:start position:0%
a year at the most
on

01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
small farms
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
are going to be producing product that
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
is very different
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
to the other which is a problem
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
representing all me
 
01:08:02.549 --> 01:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
i've been working in i worked in
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
agriculture for 25 years yeah represent
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
almi uh
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
i want to limit this
 
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
the commissioner i know and then once
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
with two of that then we want to go to
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
the other bills i i did and we'll come
 
01:08:16.159 --> 01:08:18.309 align:start position:0%
the other bills i i did and we'll come
back

01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:08:18.319 --> 01:08:20.149 align:start position:0%
back
okay

01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
now i forgot any other questions i had
 
01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.590 align:start position:0%
now i forgot any other questions i had
before

01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.110 align:start position:0%
before

spellsbury
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman representative
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
lofman anticipated a good portion of my
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
question so
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's not typical that states engage in
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial business activity like
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
this fortunately we have
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
a successful model with the liquor
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
commission to look at
 
01:08:43.759 --> 01:08:45.669 align:start position:0%
commission to look at
but

01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:08:45.679 --> 01:08:47.189 align:start position:0%
but
inevitably

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
inevitably
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
an entrepreneurial enterprise has to
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
work in supply demand conditions where
 
01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
competition is generally considered an
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
advantage in terms of
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
superior service superior product
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
best pricing etc etc so we don't need to
 
01:09:02.719 --> 01:09:03.590 align:start position:0%
best pricing etc etc so we don't need to
go

01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
into the economics but
 
01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.550 align:start position:0%
into the economics but
wouldn't

01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
the answer to the 15
 
01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.550 align:start position:0%
the answer to the 15
producer

01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
producer
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
issue which i think we all agree is too
 
01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:17.510 align:start position:0%
issue which i think we all agree is too
constrained

01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
constrained
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
be not to lift it to a higher number but
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
to rather have no numerical limit on the
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
number of growers but rather instead
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
rely on your licensing criteria to
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
determine who qualifies and let that be
 
01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.070 align:start position:0%
determine who qualifies and let that be
unlimited

01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
unlimited
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
i feel that that would be a prudent
 
01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
01:09:44.159 --> 01:09:46.149 align:start position:0%
representative ames
uh

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
two questions first is uh
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
about your timeline you're ramping up
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
the three stores and the first year
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
that discussion
 
01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:55.590 align:start position:0%
that discussion
um

01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
don't you need to have regulations in
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
place before you
 
01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
go forward
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
and how long will that take
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
i think that you know obviously rules
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
need to be written and and people need
 
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
to be hired within the organization
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
before we can branch out to the stores
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh i you know rules would take some time
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
i think that there was an october date
 
01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.270 align:start position:0%
i think that there was an october date
in

01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.149 align:start position:0%
in
uh

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
the original one of the original drafts
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
that we feel would be too constraining
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
as far as opening the stores i mean
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
you've seen what we've done with the
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
liquor and wine outlets and how many
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
we've opened over a period of time we've
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
opened as many as seven in one year this
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
past year we've opened four next year
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
we'll open four so to open three stores
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
with the type of
 
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
retail footprint that we're talking
 
01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:48.790 align:start position:0%
retail footprint that we're talking
about

01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
we feel would be much easier than
 
01:10:51.199 --> 01:10:52.790 align:start position:0%
we feel would be much easier than
opening

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
opening
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
a 12 to 25 000 square foot store i mean
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
these stores are will be small they'll
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
technically advanced
 
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
because everything has to be taken out
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
of climatically controlled safes and put
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
into climately controlled cases and
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
everything obviously has to be
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
under uh cameras we'll have smart safes
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
like we do in our stores now we'll have
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
armored car pickup like we do in our
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
stores now so from a technological
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
standpoint the stores will be compact
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
but very advanced i feel that we can do
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
i feel that we can safely do three in
 
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
the first year and we may in fact you
 
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
know we may in fact be able to do more
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
depending on
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
how much groundwork we can get done and
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
the availability of the products that we
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
need just like anything else
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
build out takes time we're finding that
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
steel and and
 
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
you know lumber and cases and shelving
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
are all taking an exponential amount of
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
time at this point so
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that i just have one
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
it's about revenues and the projection
 
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
of revenues and uh
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
it's not really the ramp up but
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
but trying to figure out what revenues
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
will come from this enterprise
 
01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.590 align:start position:0%
will come from this enterprise
um

01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
i'd like to i'd like to
 
01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
if you could reach back to give
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh two parts to that estimate one is uh
 
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
what what is the number that you're
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
projecting now a little unclear on that
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
and then the second thing is uh what
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
about edibles because we've heard a lot
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
about how edibles are
 
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
a very important part of the uh
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
of the market and uh the consumers are
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's what many consumers want um and
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
yet in this bill
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
as it's written uh edibles are not going
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
to be on your shelves
 
01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
i haven't heard anything about how
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
the absence of edibles affects your
 
01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.430 align:start position:0%
the absence of edibles affects your
projections

01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
well i think that in in looking at what
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
edibles do across the country i think
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
you're looking at somewhere between
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
35 to 45 of the business in
 
01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.149 align:start position:0%
35 to 45 of the business in
uh

01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
in a retail location so i think that you
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
could safely
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
subtract that number from
 
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.430 align:start position:0%
subtract that number from
projections

01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
projections
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh should should edibles
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
not be allowed to be in these particular
 
01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.070 align:start position:0%
not be allowed to be in these particular
locations

01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
locations
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
and the the larger number that
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
you're working with the
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
the 35 would come off of what
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
of the 50 million
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
of the 50 million 50.
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
there's one part the first question was
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
how long do you
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
would it take to get the
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
regulations and
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
i i don't want to to take a hard and
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
fast stand on that mr chairman i think
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
that it would certainly take some time
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
and we'd have to we'd have to look at
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
we'd have to look at what was being
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
asked of the commission from a financial
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
standpoint uh what we were being asked
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
to work with i would certainly think
 
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
that would wouldn't be
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
more than i i think it would be
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
at least six months perhaps a little bit
 
01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.390 align:start position:0%
at least six months perhaps a little bit
more

01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
okay i'm six to eight months
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative brownie yeah thank you
 
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
yeah the subcommittee that was one of
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
the issues we talked about
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
and we all concluded that what was in
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
the bill was too tight of a time frame
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
it is so type of
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
it so the minimum was at least
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
what did you just say i'm sorry six i
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
think it would take six months at least
 
01:15:00.149 --> 01:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
six six
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
six to nine months
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
to do to finish the rules yeah
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
to do the rules
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
i mean that's getting their part getting
 
01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.110 align:start position:0%
i mean that's getting their part getting
there

01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
then doesn't have to get it to jail car
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
after that so
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
when you add that in it's you know
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
because this is all new i mean they're
 
01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
starting from scratch here with these
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
rules i mean this isn't adding rules to
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
existing agency thank you
 
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
robzona tucker
 
01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
yes i don't remember which of the three
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
lengthy days we discussed so many
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
subjects at session
 
01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
but there was mention made of
 
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:34.870 align:start position:0%
but there was mention made of
the

01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:35.750 align:start position:0%
the
uh

01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
wages paid to by the liquor commission
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
at the stores
 
01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
on the floor at some time and i don't
 
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
remember in relation to what
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
but would you anticipate
 
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
the same wage scales
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
at the cannabis stores as you do uh at
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
the liquor stores and could you give us
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
an idea of what those
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh the average
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
person working at a liquor store makes
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
because we would end up being employers
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
right so you are employers and therefore
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
when they bring it up at a session it's
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
talking about what we
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
are endorsing as wage scales
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
well i can i can tell you that the the
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
wages at the liquor for the starting
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
wages at the liquor commission
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
are uh
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
around 13 an hour for a clerk
 
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
for a labor
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
and it goes up from there obviously we
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
follow the same
 
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
scale that the state uses our our folks
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
are paid
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
at the same scale
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
now in a cannabis location i feel that
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
a great amount of education that these
 
01:16:58.229 --> 01:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
folks would need to undertake
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
prior to them working as a retail person
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
in this store
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
from a labor standpoint actually meaning
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
you're not picking up 47 pound average
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
cases of spirits you're you're from so
 
01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:13.270 align:start position:0%
cases of spirits you're you're from so
from

01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
a strenuous labor standpoint it would be
 
01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
the labor piece of it would be less
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
intense but i also feel that there's an
 
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
educational piece
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
that needs to be brought in
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
and there's certainly
 
01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
a certain maturity level that we would
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
expect these employees to have
 
01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
and i don't feel that following the
 
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
state guidelines
 
01:17:40.229 --> 01:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
is going to attract the type of
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
employees that we would need
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
so where we would need to be at this
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
point i'm unsure because i've done less
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
homework on that
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
based on
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
what private industry is paying but i
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
can assure you that it would probably be
 
01:17:58.719 --> 01:18:00.470 align:start position:0%
can assure you that it would probably be
somewhere

01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
at least
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
one-third to
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
50 percent
 
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
more than what we're paying our retail
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
people in the stores now i would project
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
that we would have to be somewhere in
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
the 18 to 25 dollar an hour range so
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
that does make a difference on the
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
revenues i mean
 
01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:21.910 align:start position:0%
revenues i mean
that

01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
well i think what it does it certainly
 
01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:25.510 align:start position:0%
well i think what it does it certainly
does

01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
but i also think that
 
01:18:29.669 --> 01:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
rent is a function of volume
 
01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:32.790 align:start position:0%
rent is a function of volume
so

01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
if we run the stores properly which
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
i can assure you we will
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
and we have the pricing
 
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's competitive with the new england
 
01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
states i feel that uh
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
our projections are conservative and
 
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
i've always we've always taken that
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
approach in everything we do
 
01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
would you anticipate
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
i apologize
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh would you expect the same benefit
 
01:19:05.669 --> 01:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
packages to be
 
01:19:05.679 --> 01:19:07.270 align:start position:0%
packages to be
at

01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
the liquor stores as well as the
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis stores
 
01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
i think that we would follow the state
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
guidelines as far as full-time benefits
 
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
are concerned
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
and i believe that if we i'm not sure
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
that we put
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
any part-time people in the stores and
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
our projections and if we did it was a
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
de minimis amount i feel that this is
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
folks that uh
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
that would be interested in this type of
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
thing are there professionals in nature
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
they they they have the knowledge of the
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
product uh you know they're involved
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
with the product already
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere and those are the type of
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
people that we would need to hire
 
01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
mr uh commissioner just a quick question
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
going back to the rules conversation if
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
i was to amend we did amend the rules
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
because we recognize in the subcommittee
 
01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
and the amendment i have but we use
 
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
december of 22 but if i was to change
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
that so it wasn't a hard date and just
 
01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.709 align:start position:0%
that so it wasn't a hard date and just
said

01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:08.719 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
you have to have it eight months after
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
rules must be established eight months
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
after passage would that be reasonable i
 
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
think that would certainly be fair
 
01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
and this may be a question of the chair
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
as far as a question would be concerned
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
about regulation is regulation part of
 
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
policy or is regulation part of this
 
01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:34.709 align:start position:0%
policy or is regulation part of this
committee

01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
then i'll cut my question thank you
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:45.270 align:start position:0%
 
chamber

01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair uh this may be a
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
question for the chair also
 
01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:50.310 align:start position:0%
question for the chair also
uh

01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh we have a fiscal note
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
is there gonna be a representative from
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
the dra here
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
about these appropriation numbers
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
will they be here this afternoon or
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
tomorrow or monday
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
they don't get involved with liquor or
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
will they get involved with us well i
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up question here then
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh in determining the numbers
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
since we're talking about numbers
 
01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
and i see the agencies they contacted
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
were from administrative services
 
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
corrections health and human services
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
justice revenue safety judicial judicial
 
01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
council municipal association and the
 
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
association of counties
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
and the gentleman
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
speaks about agriculture why was the
 
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
department of agricultural markets and
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
foods not contacted about
 
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
the cost to them
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative chad's gonna allow me to
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
answer that so can you look what number
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
what's the number on the bill you're
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
looking at on that sheet because there's
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
one from a prior bill that was rent uh
 
01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh the late randy cushing's bill
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
and that was that was the very extensive
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
the numbers that you
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
yeah those numbers are from the last
 
01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:04.310 align:start position:0%
yeah those numbers are from the last
major

01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
major
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh bill we wanted to try to compare
 
01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
those numbers to
 
01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:08.790 align:start position:0%
those numbers to
[Music]

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
this bill so that fiscal note you're
 
01:22:12.149 --> 01:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
looking at and that's why you see
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
revenue there
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
department of revenue actually did the
 
01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:16.719 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates because it was taxing
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
then it was tax that was a tax bill this
 
01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
is not a tax bill this is a net revenue
 
01:22:21.199 --> 01:22:22.310 align:start position:0%
is not a tax bill this is a net revenue
bill

01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
so so on the top of the breastfeed's
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
gonna what's the num what's the build
 
01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:31.669 align:start position:0%
gonna what's the num what's the build
number

01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
minon oh there it is
 
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
hb237 right exactly so that's a bill
 
01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
from last year
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
that was a full
 
01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:41.430 align:start position:0%
that was a full
full

01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
full
 
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
legalization and commercialization bill
 
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
traditional model bill that's why that's
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
what you see there so that
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
although even with that the revenues i
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned that earlier it was
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue did do those
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates because it was taxing
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
they taxed at the agriculture level
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
and then they taxed at the retail level
 
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
and i think it at the upper end it was
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
like 40 million is what they had come up
 
01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:06.310 align:start position:0%
like 40 million is what they had come up
with

01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
thank you is that answer your question
 
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative murphy
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you again
 
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just asking since edibles are
 
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
currently not in the bill right now what
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
is the product line that we are talking
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
about is it
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
just flowers is it you know topicals
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
cartridges i mean or is it just flowers
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
i think it would be anything that was
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
available for retail sale other than the
 
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
edibles which would be flour it would be
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
topicals it would be uh
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
concentrate concentrates okay it would
 
01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:43.990 align:start position:0%
concentrate concentrates okay it would
be

01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
it would be vape it would be accessories
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
okay so it's everything else except for
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
edibles right now
 
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative ames followed by
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.229 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
we've talked about rules um and
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
but we haven't talked about how the
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
rules have to address
 
01:24:13.199 --> 01:24:14.790 align:start position:0%
rules have to address
cultivators

01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
cultivators
 
01:24:16.629 --> 01:24:16.639 align:start position:0%
you're going to be the regulatory
 
01:24:16.639 --> 01:24:17.910 align:start position:0%
you're going to be the regulatory
authority

01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
for this whole
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
whole thing
 
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
so um cultivators will be part of it and
 
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
i have a
 
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.189 align:start position:0%
i have a
a

01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:24:29.199 --> 01:24:31.270 align:start position:0%
a
particular

01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
question about
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
the product that cultivators will be
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
growing and then
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
presumably moving on to
 
01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:42.790 align:start position:0%
presumably moving on to
manufacturers

01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
and then moving on to your stores
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
and that is tracking these
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
the product from the beginning
 
01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:52.870 align:start position:0%
the product from the beginning
to

01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:24:55.110 --> 01:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
when it's sold
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
and in prior bills we've had a tracking
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
system built into the legislation which
 
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
involves unique identifiers
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about that in this bill
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
which we've raised as a concern when
 
01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:10.229 align:start position:0%
which we've raised as a concern when
we're

01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
meeting as a subcommittee um i wonder if
 
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
you thought at all about this the
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
context of course is there's a black
 
01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:18.470 align:start position:0%
context of course is there's a black
market

01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
and it's considerable and price has
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
something to do with
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
with uh diminishing that i would assume
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
competition but also
 
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
people playing in the black market can
 
01:25:36.159 --> 01:25:38.550 align:start position:0%
people playing in the black market can
function

01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.430 align:start position:0%
function
and

01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
i should think identifying the ability
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
to identify product
 
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh would relate to that so that's the
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
well i again i go back i go back to uh
 
01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
the rule making and i go back to the
 
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
negotiate because in my mind that person
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
has the level of expertise to guide the
 
01:26:03.679 --> 01:26:04.709 align:start position:0%
has the level of expertise to guide the
commission

01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
not only in the rule making but in the
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
process of cultivation
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead and represent
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
when i checked the liquor liquor when i
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
chaired the marijuana commission
 
01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
that was one of our recommendations to
 
01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
have a tracking system
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
it did the bill came over to us without
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
that in it and i didn't bring that one
 
01:26:35.110 --> 01:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
up really early on because
 
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
was that really part of our job here
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like you'll be addressing
 
01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.629 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like you'll be addressing
that

01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes
 
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
as a need to um other states have that
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
where they track it
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
every step of the way in the supply
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
chain i guess you want to call it the
 
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
supply chain of of uh
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
of the product
 
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay much like we do with liquor now
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
right and you know we affidavi so you
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
don't you don't need something specific
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
in the bill you you'll be addressing
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
that as part of your rules it will be
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
addressed in the rules okay thank you
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative ames are you all through
 
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
two questions again unfortunately um
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
oh no they're they're actually together
 
01:27:24.149 --> 01:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
on what
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
is enforcement going to be doing
 
01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
with marijuana that they are not already
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
doing now just to make sure it isn't
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
bleeding into the entire law enforcement
 
01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.830 align:start position:0%
bleeding into the entire law enforcement
on

01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:40.470 align:start position:0%
on
cannabis

01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.470 align:start position:0%
 
does

01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
do you oh i guess the other one's a
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
do what are they going to be enforcing
 
01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
only what's going on in the stores
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
are they going to be trying to enforce
 
01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.390 align:start position:0%
are they going to be trying to enforce
uh

01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
the the um
 
01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:01.590 align:start position:0%
the the um
product

01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:02.709 align:start position:0%
product
growing

01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
growing
 
01:28:02.719 --> 01:28:03.990 align:start position:0%
growing
on

01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
in the on the farms
 
01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:08.470 align:start position:0%
in the on the farms
uh

01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
to see if they're bringing in product
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
from somewhere else
 
01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:14.870 align:start position:0%
from somewhere else
uh

01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
and your question
 
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
this is my question one of one of my two
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
questions one of them is is that how how
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
much enforcement do they actually have
 
01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
to do under this bill
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
does it only have to be what's going on
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
in the stores and the supply chain
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
they would be concerned with
 
01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
the product in in our stores the supply
 
01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
chain from from the grower to the stores
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
and work with as they do now
 
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
other local law enforcement agencies and
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
the state police on anything outside of
 
01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
that scope if something happens in a
 
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
particular town if if they if they see
 
01:28:59.350 --> 01:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
something going on that
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
they feel is
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
is worthy of bringing to a level then
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's what they do now we work
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
hand in hand with the municipalities and
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
state police now and we would take that
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
the same way
 
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has to leave to go to
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal yes and we thank you for
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
coming here and answering
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
addressing our questions thank you very
 
01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:22.709 align:start position:0%

01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
okay mr chairman members of the
 
01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:26.719 align:start position:0%
committee work we appreciate it
 
01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
work session on house bill
 
01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:36.229 align:start position:0%
work session on house bill
1590

01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
just i think the
 
01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:43.669 align:start position:0%
just i think the
enforcement

01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:29:46.229 --> 01:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
um representative albany was going there
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
there's some a myriad of questions that
 
01:29:50.830 --> 01:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
need to be cleared up for enforced
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement i
 
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
i mean they don't automatically happen
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
in rulemaking there's a there's a i see
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
a gap between what's been explained and
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
what is needed to know that's all enough
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
there's a future time where enforcement
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
can come and iterate on those things
 
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
that would be wonderful thank you okay
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hatch yeah and
 
01:30:13.110 --> 01:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
we do we do have him here but
 
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
you're willing to come back at any one
 
01:30:21.669 --> 01:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
yeah that may work too well i i actually
 
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
i just i think it's better in the open
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
forum i'm willing to get together
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
anytime but just just so everybody has a
 
01:30:31.199 --> 01:30:32.310 align:start position:0%
anytime but just just so everybody has a
clear

01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
understanding of the process and what's
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
going to be done going forward and i
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
think it's kind of important mr chair it
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to happen now can happen
 
01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:40.950 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to happen now can happen
anytime

and thank you for staying and taking the
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
questions it's just explain uh what
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement will do
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
the skyview picture of what you'll be
 
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
doing in terms of enforcing cannabis
 
01:31:57.669 --> 01:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
from start to finish i i
 
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
just in my mind and i'm glad you
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
referenced that you'll
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
be working very closely with other law
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies who are overseeing
 
01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
this now
 
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
and and that dynamic won't change that
 
01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
much or will it and and if you could
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
just explain
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
the extent of your environment and
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement for cannabis
 
01:32:24.149 --> 01:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
going forward is that
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
clear enough i mean
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
it is it is thank you for your question
 
01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:29.590 align:start position:0%
it is it is thank you for your question
representative

01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:30.709 align:start position:0%
representative
um

01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
first and foremost um i think we've
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
testified several times that our
 
01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:37.590 align:start position:0%
testified several times that our
uh

01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
our partnerships with our municipal
 
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
partners and state partners is
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly great
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
um we are in and thank you for bringing
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
that up earlier and i know i've
 
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
testified in front of you guys
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
a handful of times on on this issue who
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
we are and what we do
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
um right now we are uh regulating the
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
industry of alcohol and tobacco
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
which kind of gets forgotten uh the
 
01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
tobacco side of it this is very similar
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
to that infrastruc infrastructure
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
um we as uh representative almi brought
 
01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
up uh we would be looking at this and
 
01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
and the chairman said so eloquently
 
01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
we're looking at this from a level of
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
the tier system
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
um there are many states that do it that
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
way regulate that way from
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
what we would look at manufacturing on
 
01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:32.470 align:start position:0%
what we would look at manufacturing on
the

01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh alcohol side of the house we're
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
looking at cultivation
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
on the cannabis side of the house and we
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
would be regulating from that level all
 
01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
the way through with our not only our
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
investigators that have been earmarked
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
these duties but also with our uh
 
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
civilian auditors
 
01:33:57.110 --> 01:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
who will be trained in in this specific
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh realm
 
01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh our infrastructure
 
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
as the chairman brought it up i i
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
foresee this and we've had uh
 
01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
conversations about this breaking down
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
further into a bureau system uh such as
 
01:34:16.709 --> 01:34:16.719 align:start position:0%
what i came from over at state police
 
01:34:16.719 --> 01:34:18.390 align:start position:0%
what i came from over at state police
where

01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
we would be looking at
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
the bureau of cannabis control
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
in that cannabis control as long as the
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
model right now that we're looking at
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
is a state model and not a privatized
 
01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:33.910 align:start position:0%
is a state model and not a privatized
model

01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
model
 
01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
we could do that with approximately
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
the way we look at it now about uh for
 
01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:42.149 align:start position:0%
the way we look at it now about uh for
investigators

01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
investigators
 
01:34:45.109 --> 01:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
with a leadership structure to that
 
01:34:45.119 --> 01:34:46.870 align:start position:0%
with a leadership structure to that
um

01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
auditors we're looking at three auditors
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
and and we also have a licensing
 
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
component of that too because we'd have
 
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
to add staff to the front end of the
 
01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:57.430 align:start position:0%
to add staff to the front end of the
house

01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
for a lack of a better term
 
01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.470 align:start position:0%
for a lack of a better term
um

01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
we do foresee
 
01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:04.790 align:start position:0%
we do foresee
that

01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:07.030 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
a a possibility we don't know this is an
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
unknown but a possibility of a black
 
01:35:12.159 --> 01:35:13.910 align:start position:0%
unknown but a possibility of a black
market

01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
we deal with that now on the alcohol and
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
tobacco side of the house
 
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
we have a special investigative unit
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
that deals with
 
01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
fraud rings
 
01:35:24.639 --> 01:35:26.470 align:start position:0%
fraud rings
and

01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
theft rings throughout the state
 
01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh bootlegging tobacco into this state
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh there is a bootlegging we don't see
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
it because
 
01:35:38.229 --> 01:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
as as most of you know um i'm not from
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
the marketing side of the house but we
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
sell alcohol pretty darn cheap
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
so we don't have the bootlegging problem
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
that we do
 
01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
that we see with tobacco
 
01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
and we have an infrastructure that
 
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
is set up in model form right now
 
01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:56.390 align:start position:0%
is set up in model form right now
to

01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
deter against that with
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
our the assistance of our our local and
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
did i answer your question uh
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative hatch
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i just wanted to overview
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
for example if there is
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement taking place
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
and somebody is
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
illegally selling or utilizing cannabis
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
in whatever manner
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
how far the agency takes it to
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
adjudication or for the most part you
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
would be would you be turning that over
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
to other
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement entities to carry it
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
through adjudicating because that can
 
01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
take a lot of time ergo costs absolutely
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question thank you
 
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
for it um as you as you know and and
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
we've had conversations there are
 
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
certain cases that we will take to
 
01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:52.550 align:start position:0%
certain cases that we will take to
fruition

01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
fruition
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
and from its inception on through
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
um the reason for that is the continuity
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
of the case consistency with the case
 
01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
continuity of evidence
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh but i foresee and i know a lot of you
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
have heard me say this
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
um i foresee this um uh
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
venture if you will
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
to be handled the same way as everything
 
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
else in the division that's starting
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
accountability with our education
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
platform we believe education is going
 
01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
to be a big part of this
 
01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be a big part of
 
01:37:28.719 --> 01:37:30.390 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be a big part of
assisting

01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
assisting
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
us assist our new prospective licensees
 
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
and being in compliance
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
we believe that um
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
we have proven
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
i i should correct myself we have proven
 
01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
that that education platform
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
adequate in
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
having industry actually
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
in a
 
01:37:58.950 --> 01:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
in a different sense
 
01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
supporting our endeavors
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
the people we re regulate like us
 
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
um that's different throughout the
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
country um because sometimes it's the
 
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
iron fist coming down and not telling
 
01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:13.270 align:start position:0%
iron fist coming down and not telling
people

01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:14.149 align:start position:0%
people
how

01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
how what did i do wrong how did i do it
 
01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:18.149 align:start position:0%
how what did i do wrong how did i do it
wrong

01:38:18.149 --> 01:38:18.159 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure you're going to come in
 
01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
next month and
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
tell me i'm doing it wrong again and
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
you've never told me what i did wrong so
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
we believe from an auditing view all the
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
way through to the regulatory portion of
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
it and and
 
01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:34.709 align:start position:0%
it and and
enforcement

01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
um begins with that education piece
 
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
and i know you've heard me talk about
 
01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
anybody else if if i could uh
 
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
deputy uh chief uh elston had a little
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
bit more to add to that if i could give
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
her a couple seconds if that's why
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
another you know building out on that
 
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
educational platform is also going to be
 
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
the youth access to to the product where
 
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
the primary law enforcement agency and
 
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
the youth access to tobacco
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
also you know we regulate the industry
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
in terms of youth access with alcohol so
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
a large component of that enforcement
 
01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:18.470 align:start position:0%
a large component of that enforcement
umbrella

01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
umbrella
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
involves um preventing the youth access
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
representative tucker followed by
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative alani
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
yes i was just
 
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
thinking about the differences between
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
liquor and cannabis
 
01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:37.030 align:start position:0%
liquor and cannabis
so

01:39:37.030 --> 01:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
when you buy liquor
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
if you're buying it by the drink or
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
whether you're buying it by the bottle
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
at a liquor store
 
01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
the rules of where you can use
 
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
and consume that product are very clear
 
01:39:53.590 --> 01:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
but with cannabis
 
01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
how is it going to work where will one
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
know where one can consume the cannabis
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
will there be
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
smoking in restaurants
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
will there be outdoor patios can you go
 
01:40:09.109 --> 01:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
to a
 
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
public spaces
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
how are we going to manage this aspect
 
01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:19.750 align:start position:0%
how are we going to manage this aspect
of

01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
giving the state seal so to speak
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
that it's all right
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
to buy and use cannabis how will that
 
01:40:28.159 --> 01:40:29.750 align:start position:0%
to buy and use cannabis how will that
translate

01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
translate
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
into the day-to-day operations of the
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
state and where people can use that
 
01:40:38.229 --> 01:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
cannabis and that seems to fall
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
to some extent under enforcement how
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
would more people
 
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
help people know where they can consume
 
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
the product
 
01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
well first of all thank you for your
 
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
question representative i think first of
 
01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:56.550 align:start position:0%
question representative i think first of
all

01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement does just that and i've been
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
successful in this career for 35 years
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
living by that and and that that adage
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
and that is that we enforce the laws
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
that you all create here
 
01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:12.149 align:start position:0%
that you all create here
um

01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
we are going to be diligent with our
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
rule making on this we feel that the
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
making can
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
create bookmarkers if you will
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
we will
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
also assist all of you in
 
01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
seeing what the industry standards are
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the country
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
and and coming up with the best if that
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
is what you all choose and the other
 
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh the other committees uh throughout
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
this building that are involved in this
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
choose to do
 
01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
um we will help you um make sure that
 
01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
the people that have chosen
 
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
to consume
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
this product are the ones that actually
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
um are the ones that are ingesting it um
 
01:41:58.830 --> 01:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
just like tobacco i mean we always think
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
liquor but we regulate tobacco in this
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
state also and it's very similar to
 
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
tobacco and nicotine
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
a comment from representative romney yes
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
so in the bill they do have provisions
 
01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:16.390 align:start position:0%
so in the bill they do have provisions
for

01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
no smoking outdoors any public place
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
is in the build so that's that's taken
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
care of
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
and i can't recall if if
 
01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes you get my things mixed up
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's in this bill or another
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
about apartment buildings
 
01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
not not being able to smoke in apartment
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
buildings because it goes from one
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
apartment to the other i'm not quite
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
sure if it's in this bill or not but
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
definitely no outside public place can
 
01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
you smoke or or even use edibles no nor
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
in any moving vehicle
 
01:42:48.070 --> 01:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
nor anything and then moving vehicles
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
moving the vehicle right
 
01:42:50.239 --> 01:42:58.550 align:start position:0%
moving the vehicle right
apart

01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not talking about tobacco we're
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
talking about marijuana and i've seen
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
i've seen some
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
states that have banned it from
 
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings and i can't recall
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
if it's in this bill or not that's all
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative army
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you i think i counted up at least
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
eight new staff for enforcement
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
about how much
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
is that like and some of them are high
 
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
level the auditors
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
about how much is that
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
in the personnel costs
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
um i would only be
 
01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
it probably would be
 
01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
irresponsible for me to give you a
 
01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
figure right now representative and
 
01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
just because i don't have that flow
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
chart with me and i don't have the exact
 
01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
and i think tina tina was the perfect
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
person to have for that question
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
um i could i could ballpark it but it
 
01:43:57.990 --> 01:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
would be irresponsible for me to do that
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
at this point but it's about eight staff
 
01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:02.229 align:start position:0%
at this point but it's about eight staff
um

01:44:02.229 --> 01:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at approximately eight staff
 
01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
correct with leadership involved thank
 
01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:08.149 align:start position:0%
correct with leadership involved thank
you

01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
and oversight ask a question
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
about edibles if we do not do edibles
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
there will be a black market in edibles
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
on are you going to be responsible for
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
that or will that be someone else
 
01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:25.189 align:start position:0%
that or will that be someone else
um

01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:27.510 --> 01:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative um
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%

01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
cbd is in our combination stores right
 
01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
now it's a problem that we've been
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
talking with the
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
dea on
 
01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:44.790 align:start position:0%

and
 
01:44:49.109 --> 01:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
of course cbd topical is legal because
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
of the federal farm bill
 
01:44:52.709 --> 01:44:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh but the
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
adulterated products aren't um we we
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
would we would do as we do right now
 
01:45:01.350 --> 01:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
with those products and our combinations
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
that show up
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
we handle those issues
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
that is something that traditional law
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%

01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction or another but

01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
issues that are going on in the
 
01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
traditional law enforcement world it's
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
something that we would actually be
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%

yes
 
01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
can someone just go over the concerns we

don't remember either i didn't bring my
 
01:47:34.159 --> 01:47:42.149 align:start position:0%
don't remember either i didn't bring my
papers

01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:45.189 --> 01:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
representative bernstein
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%

01:47:58.470 --> 01:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
it adds to cigars it adds
 
01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:00.629 align:start position:0%

cigarettes

cigarettes
 
01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
and it eliminates
 
01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
as well as revenue generated from other
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
tobacco sales in stores including
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%

01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
revenue from keno
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
mail order and internet sales
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
should not be used to determine whether
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
an establishment satisfies the
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
definition of a cigar bar
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%

see here
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
it sounds this bill it seems like this
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
bill was filed for one store
 
01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:53.430 align:start position:0%
bill was filed for one store
um

01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
and we had we had uh testimony from the
 
01:48:58.709 --> 01:48:58.719 align:start position:0%
cigar association of new hampshire
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
which represented five owners in 12
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
retail locations
 
01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
and they didn't see a need for this bill
 
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
the bill is really
 
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
there to
 
01:49:11.189 --> 01:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
help them help this one store hit the 60
 
01:49:11.199 --> 01:49:12.229 align:start position:0%
help them help this one store hit the 60
percent

01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:49:12.239 --> 01:49:13.510 align:start position:0%
percent
mark

01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
mark
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of tobacco uh
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
cigars or tobacco products being sold
 
01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:20.950 align:start position:0%
cigars or tobacco products being sold
um

01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
i i don't think we need i don't
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
at this moment i'm an itl
 
01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
on this because i i don't think we
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
should change our current statute to and
 
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
and that one story i don't think
 
01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
testified if i recall
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh clutier it's his bill i think
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh they both talked about
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
this one store that
 
01:49:43.669 --> 01:49:43.679 align:start position:0%
feels without this they can't hit that
 
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
so that's my understanding
 
01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:51.430 align:start position:0%
so that's my understanding
representative

01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
i think that's very well put except that
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
codier i think was representing the
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
other than that i agree entirely
 
01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:04.870 align:start position:0%
other than that i agree entirely
representing

01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
representing
 
01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman my sense was
 
01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
that the bill is originally drafted had
 
01:50:11.189 --> 01:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
a serious problem
 
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
a because it was changing the formula by
 
01:50:15.589 --> 01:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
lowering the percentage threshold and
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
and b because it was temporary and
 
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
therefore was going to
 
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
whip back in a couple of years
 
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:23.270 align:start position:0%
whip back in a couple of years
but

01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
my sense is from the perspective of this
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
committee the commerce um committee
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
solved that problem if they're okay with
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
it and the house is okay with it i'm not
 
01:50:37.669 --> 01:50:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
yes i just wanted to say that i um
 
01:50:47.669 --> 01:50:47.679 align:start position:0%
echo what uh representative abram and he
 
01:50:47.679 --> 01:50:48.870 align:start position:0%
echo what uh representative abram and he
said

01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:50:51.030 --> 01:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
the cigar association
 
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
had no issues with it at all and um and
 
01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
i think it might have been
 
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton that mentioned
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:51:02.550 --> 01:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic people weren't
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
frequenting um cigar bars and as much
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
but i mean we're kind of
 
01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
nearing the end of of that where you
 
01:51:12.070 --> 01:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
know mass mandates are being lifted
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
people are starting to go out a lot more
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
i think this is a temporary problem
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
in one specific instance that is most
 
01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
likely going to go away anyhow so i
 
01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
think i'm i would also
 
01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
be itl on this
 
01:51:27.990 --> 01:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative line followed by
 
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.510 align:start position:0%
representative line followed by
represents

01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
represents
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
so i i guess i agree with representative
 
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
spillsbury that
 
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what
 
01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here
 
01:51:37.589 --> 01:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
commerce fix the problems with the
 
01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
temporary nature and those kind of
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
things we're down just left to whether
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
or not we agree that the percentage
 
01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
should include loose cigarettes and
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
loose tobacco versus just straight cigar
 
01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:49.350 align:start position:0%
loose tobacco versus just straight cigar
sales

01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
sales
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
um and i i guess i i'm i'm more in line
 
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
of a if it helps the business and it
 
01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't hurt the state then why would we
 
01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
oppose this
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
um if the business can generate more
 
01:52:03.189 --> 01:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
revenue and can um
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
can increase again don't forget loose
 
01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
tobacco and cigarette sales generates
 
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
revenue for us um it it seems like it's
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
a win-win and i'm just not sure why we
 
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't allow whether it's just one
 
01:52:16.470 --> 01:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
today it could be five tomorrow and this
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
may help them tomorrow
 
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
i just don't see a downside of passing
 
01:52:23.189 --> 01:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
this bill i guess is my point is i see
 
01:52:25.109 --> 01:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
no downside of passing it
 
01:52:25.119 --> 01:52:26.870 align:start position:0%
no downside of passing it
rubs

01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
rubs
 
01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i echo those
 
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
sentiments and would also like to say
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
that in the bill it doesn't say that
 
01:52:34.070 --> 01:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
they can use cigarettes and loose
 
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
tobacco inside the cigar bar it says
 
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
they can sell it to meet the guideline
 
01:52:41.350 --> 01:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
that they need to meet uh for their for
 
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
their profits in order to be
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
to be in statute um so
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
we're not turning it into an entire
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
smoking establishment with drinks or
 
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
food it is still only cigars and maybe
 
01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
is it pipes too i think
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
no i'm talking about what they can
 
01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:02.719 align:start position:0%
consume currently right now
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
and uh if they're not going if they're
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
just using it towards sales it's all
 
01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:07.990 align:start position:0%
just using it towards sales it's all
tobacco

01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
tobacco
 
01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's cigar tobacco or it's
 
01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
cigarette tobacco or loose tobacco or
 
01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
whatever it's all tobacco
 
01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:14.390 align:start position:0%
whatever it's all tobacco
so

01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
i know these are niche
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
establishments that were
 
01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
that were put into statute to be able to
 
01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
do this
 
01:53:24.070 --> 01:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
but i don't i don't see a downside to
 
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
allowing them to have the the full
 
01:53:28.629 --> 01:53:28.639 align:start position:0%
tobacco sale in there if they're still
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
only consuming what was originally
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
appropriated for them
 
01:53:35.669 --> 01:53:35.679 align:start position:0%
representative aaron
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
so as i understand it the bill is
 
01:53:39.599 --> 01:53:41.030 align:start position:0%
so as i understand it the bill is
amended

01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
amended
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
allows for the sale of cigar cigarettes
 
01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
to be included to meet the 60 percent
 
01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:50.310 align:start position:0%
to be included to meet the 60 percent
threshold

01:53:50.310 --> 01:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
01:53:52.229 --> 01:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
that they
 
01:53:53.589 --> 01:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
have to meet
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
um they already sell cigarettes but it's
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
not counted towards or and loose tobacco
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
but it's not counted towards their 60
 
01:54:02.239 --> 01:54:03.350 align:start position:0%
but it's not counted towards their 60
so

01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:06.070 --> 01:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
it's not like they aren't selling the
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
product already um
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
i i i actually i don't see a problem
 
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
with making the change but um
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know since
 
01:54:17.589 --> 01:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
it's not like they're
 
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
being allowed to sell a product now that
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
they haven't been allowed to sell
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm hearing some of the comments
 
01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
now i have a question does anybody know
 
01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:32.229 align:start position:0%
now i have a question does anybody know
why

01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
why was this law initially put into
 
01:54:35.830 --> 01:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
place where it was 60 what is the
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
significance of the 60 percent i don't
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:46.629 --> 01:54:46.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know if anybody can answer that
 
01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
question well i think i remember
 
01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:50.550 align:start position:0%
question well i think i remember
almy

01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
almy
 
01:54:52.629 --> 01:54:52.639 align:start position:0%
yeah that they
 
01:54:52.639 --> 01:54:53.750 align:start position:0%
yeah that they
they

01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
the cigar
 
01:54:57.030 --> 01:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
groups which
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
we have a representative of right here
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
had suggested that i believe to
 
01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
differentiate it
 
01:55:08.149 --> 01:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
on i think that we should be clear that
 
01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
we are not talking about whether you can
 
01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
smoke or
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
or sell or whatever
 
01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
this the other kinds of tobacco all
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is are we going to
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
loosen the requirements so that
 
01:55:23.910 --> 01:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
that on
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
other um cigar stores if they get into
 
01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
trouble being cigar bars
 
01:55:33.430 --> 01:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
can still remain as cigar bars because
 
01:55:36.070 --> 01:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
we've lowered the requirement
 
01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:36.870 align:start position:0%
we've lowered the requirement
for

01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
for the percentage of sales
 
01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:43.430 align:start position:0%
for the percentage of sales
yes

01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.470 align:start position:0%
 
curtis

01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
curtis
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
do you have something you want to say
 
01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
any other lobbyists brothers i'll ask
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
you a question i'll ask you a question
 
01:55:54.070 --> 01:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:54.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:55:54.790 --> 01:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:58.229 --> 01:55:58.239 align:start position:0%
um i think your testimony was that
 
01:55:58.239 --> 01:55:59.350 align:start position:0%
um i think your testimony was that
your

01:55:59.350 --> 01:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
your facilities that you represent
 
01:56:05.669 --> 01:56:05.679 align:start position:0%
didn't really see a need for this change
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh but i guess the second part of it is
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
do you have an objection to this change
 
01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned at the hearing today do
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
they have an objection right and first
 
01:56:17.109 --> 01:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
of all mr chairman curtis barry i
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
represent the cigar association of new
 
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire which is a coalition of five
 
01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:23.679 align:start position:0%
owners in about a dozen locations
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
four of which have a cigar bar license
 
01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:26.790 align:start position:0%
four of which have a cigar bar license
um

01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
no as as i mentioned at the hearing uh
 
01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
the association had no position on the
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
bill is introduced has no position
 
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
currently either way uh as the bill is
 
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
is before the ways and means committee
 
01:56:41.589 --> 01:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
um and i can attempt to answer
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative nunez's question i think
 
01:56:45.910 --> 01:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
the philosophy on the 60 was that new
 
01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:47.030 align:start position:0%
the philosophy on the 60 was that new
hampshire

01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
does not license or allow
 
01:56:51.430 --> 01:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
a standalone bar where somebody walks in
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
and just has a drink so we have a
 
01:56:54.629 --> 01:56:54.639 align:start position:0%
requirement for a liquor license
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
currently relative to food you have to
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
have a certain amount of your sales in
 
01:56:58.800 --> 01:56:59.589 align:start position:0%
have a certain amount of your sales in
food

01:56:59.589 --> 01:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
food
 
01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
um in order to qualify for the liquor
 
01:57:03.669 --> 01:57:03.679 align:start position:0%
license the philosophy was
 
01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know much the same you needed to do
 
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
something you need to be as i put it at
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
the hearing i think you had to be the
 
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
cigar store first and then you could get
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
a liquor license not the other way
 
01:57:12.719 --> 01:57:14.470 align:start position:0%
a liquor license not the other way
around

01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%
anything else to ask
 
01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
mr berry
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you
 
01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:24.470 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you
so

01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:25.830 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:28.550 align:start position:0%
um
then

01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
let me take a stroke let me take a straw
 
01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:33.270 align:start position:0%
let me take a stroke let me take a straw
poll

01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
all those that would be in favor of
 
01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
okay you twisted my arm here
 
01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:46.070 align:start position:0%
okay you twisted my arm here
okay

01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
then it's no big deal i i just don't
 
01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
like many speakers i'm
 
01:57:53.189 --> 01:57:53.199 align:start position:0%
sorry i just don't like doing something
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
fun when it's only one store coming in
 
01:57:57.910 --> 01:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's what bothered me the most
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's fine that's fine but if the will
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
is will i'm i'm on board too
 
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
let's get on with it go on to an
 
01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:07.189 align:start position:0%
let's get on with it go on to an
executive

01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
executive
 
01:58:07.199 --> 01:58:08.550 align:start position:0%
executive
representative

01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
mr chair i just was wondering if i could
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
ask the committee um just briefly you
 
01:58:16.070 --> 01:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
know i think during one of the hearings
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
a question was raised about the dras
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
assertion that a reduction in the
 
01:58:24.629 --> 01:58:24.639 align:start position:0%
percentage of revenue
 
01:58:26.229 --> 01:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
a licensee must generate from
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%
non-premium cigar sales is likely to
 
01:58:28.719 --> 01:58:29.830 align:start position:0%
non-premium cigar sales is likely to
reduce

01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
the tobacco-related tax revenue
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
and i recall that there were several
 
01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
folks on the committee who said
 
01:58:38.070 --> 01:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
they would like to hear from the dra
 
01:58:40.149 --> 01:58:40.159 align:start position:0%
as to their explanation for that
 
01:58:40.159 --> 01:58:41.589 align:start position:0%
as to their explanation for that
assertion

01:58:41.589 --> 01:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
assertion
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
it didn't seem to be to make sense at
 
01:58:45.270 --> 01:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
the time i believe there was like a
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
counter-intuitive thought
 
01:58:50.229 --> 01:58:50.239 align:start position:0%
if you were to reduce the threshold why
 
01:58:51.830 --> 01:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
would that
 
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
reduce tobacco-related tax revenues um
 
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
did anybody recall did we get an answer
 
01:58:58.470 --> 01:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:00.470 align:start position:0%
to that
representative

01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
first it isn't the dra they don't have
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
anything to do with this
 
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's the liquor commission
 
01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
which oversees
 
01:59:11.430 --> 01:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
on dra a long time ago had something to
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
do with it but it got moved over
 
01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
the fiscal notes from liquor commission
 
01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:17.750 align:start position:0%
the fiscal notes from liquor commission
yeah

01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
and the second on
 
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
01:59:24.070 --> 01:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
these things are already sold in
 
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
most cigar bars i believe
 
01:59:29.669 --> 01:59:29.679 align:start position:0%
on as a secondary product if somebody
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
wants some
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
and so it doesn't seem likely that it's
 
01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:45.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:59:45.990 --> 01:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.950 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:59:48.950 --> 01:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:49.990 --> 01:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
01:59:52.070 --> 01:59:52.080 align:start position:0%

02:04:54.950 --> 02:04:54.960 align:start position:0%

02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
he said that's like the kiss of death
 
02:05:08.709 --> 02:05:08.719 align:start position:0%
the interim study
 
02:05:08.719 --> 02:05:10.390 align:start position:0%
the interim study
so

02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:12.550 align:start position:0%
so
uh

02:05:12.550 --> 02:05:12.560 align:start position:0%

02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
person on the majority side and
 
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
the email to the minority sponsor and a
 
02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
senator on the minority side asking them
 
02:05:33.669 --> 02:05:33.679 align:start position:0%
to contact someone from the majority
 
02:05:35.109 --> 02:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
side to see if they would do an interim
 
02:05:36.390 --> 02:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
study well
 
02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
with no reply i went to the association
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire affair association and
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
they contacted the commissioner
 
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner on thursday morning
 
02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
by uh 11 o'clock

emailed this to me
and

02:05:53.109 --> 02:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:55.510 --> 02:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
i think it's a much better
 
02:05:58.149 --> 02:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
bill than what was
 
02:06:00.149 --> 02:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
initially proposed
 
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh it clears up a lot of questions
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
and i was trying to find out from the
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner why they changed as
 
02:06:10.709 --> 02:06:10.719 align:start position:0%
representative aaron when she
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
made up her amendment
 
02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
why they went from 426
 
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
b to
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
amend rsa 425 19-a and start from there
 
02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:23.669 align:start position:0%
amend rsa 425 19-a and start from there
and

02:06:23.669 --> 02:06:23.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
425 is under title 40 it's the
 
02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
agricultural horticultural animal
 
02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
husbandry chapter 425 the department of
 
02:06:33.990 --> 02:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
agricultural markets and food
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
it was a more
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
a more
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:43.589 --> 02:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
proper area to have it in and the
 
02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner makes the statement that he
 
02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:46.229 align:start position:0%
commissioner makes the statement that he
uh

02:06:46.229 --> 02:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
says that
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
they hadn't been using rs842519
 
02:06:53.510 --> 02:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
for who knows how long
 
02:06:55.109 --> 02:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
and he said it'd be better just to
 
02:06:58.709 --> 02:06:58.719 align:start position:0%
replace all the wording
 
02:07:00.550 --> 02:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
with this amendment
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
and move forward with

02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:17.350 --> 02:07:17.360 align:start position:0%

02:07:53.599 --> 02:07:54.470 align:start position:0%

i have no problem with creating the
 
02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
structure the fun
 
02:08:13.350 --> 02:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
the capital improvement grant program
 
02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:16.709 align:start position:0%
the capital improvement grant program
fund

02:08:16.709 --> 02:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
can you turn your microphones on
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
sorry i was trying to get it moved out
 
02:08:29.350 --> 02:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
of the general fund
 
02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:31.189 align:start position:0%
of the general fund
into

02:08:31.189 --> 02:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:08:33.270 --> 02:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
to a one-time
 
02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
large grant that they could continue to
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
use but the commissioner totally object
 
02:08:42.550 --> 02:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe i made other comments i
 
02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
can't remember now
 
02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know what i recommend on this
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
since this has been dropped on us today
 
02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
we really haven't had time to
 
02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
02:08:56.800 --> 02:08:58.470 align:start position:0%
look at it
and

02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
over the weekend look at it and when we
 
02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
meet on monday
 
02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:03.589 align:start position:0%
meet on monday
uh

02:09:03.589 --> 02:09:03.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:09:03.599 --> 02:09:04.470 align:start position:0%
uh
let's

02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
let's
 
02:09:06.629 --> 02:09:06.639 align:start position:0%
come up with your comments and
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
and we should try to get the
 
02:09:09.669 --> 02:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner in here
 
02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
also on monday
 
02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
as long as we don't mix it with gummy
 
02:09:16.629 --> 02:09:16.639 align:start position:0%
bears on monday okay
 
02:09:19.510 --> 02:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
and i would take it up first
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes
 
02:09:24.229 --> 02:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
also this is now
 
02:09:27.189 --> 02:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
because it would stay as a general fund
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation something finance should
 
02:09:32.149 --> 02:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
have a say in
 
02:09:32.159 --> 02:09:33.189 align:start position:0%
have a say in
so

02:09:33.189 --> 02:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:37.350 --> 02:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
either you're talking over the weekend
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll talk to karen yes thank you
 
02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
can we just hear briefly representative
 
02:09:45.270 --> 02:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
aaron's aaron
 
02:09:46.950 --> 02:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
represent aaron you want to go through
 
02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
your amendment sure just briefly um
 
02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
because after the bill was uh
 
02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:53.350 align:start position:0%
because after the bill was uh
um

02:09:53.350 --> 02:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
introduced to our committee
 
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
i i and
 
02:10:00.069 --> 02:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
we had testimony on it afterwards during
 
02:10:01.750 --> 02:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
our lunch break i
 
02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
got a moment to sit down with
 
02:10:06.390 --> 02:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner jasper
 
02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
and asked him
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
because some of the questions that came
 
02:10:14.229 --> 02:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
up was regarding putting a cap on that
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
fund we didn't want to continually be
 
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
putting money in that where it
 
02:10:19.990 --> 02:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
accumulated and accumulated and he said
 
02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
to me he was fine if we put a million
 
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
dollar cap on this fund
 
02:10:27.270 --> 02:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
so that's what i wrote up in the first
 
02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
section of this amendment
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
and the last section of this amendment
 
02:10:35.589 --> 02:10:35.599 align:start position:0%
i had also spoken to commissioner jasper
 
02:10:35.599 --> 02:10:37.030 align:start position:0%
i had also spoken to commissioner jasper
regarding

02:10:37.030 --> 02:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:40.310 align:start position:0%
regarding
his

02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
the possibility of him doing some sort
 
02:10:44.790 --> 02:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
of annual reporting
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
so i thought that you know it was
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable to ask him to do to submit a
 
02:10:51.990 --> 02:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
report uh annually
 
02:10:53.790 --> 02:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
which would detail the amount of the
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
allocations that receive that they
 
02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
received in what entities received the
 
02:11:00.069 --> 02:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
allocations and the purposes of the
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
funds how how they were used and he was
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
fine with that and and suggested to me
 
02:11:06.790 --> 02:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
that the report should go to the
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
president of the senate the chairpersons
 
02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
of the house and senate ways and means
 
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
committee probably should be financed
 
02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
i said the house and senate finance
 
02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
committees as well
 
02:11:18.069 --> 02:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
and the house and senate committees with
 
02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over environmental and
 
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
agricultural issues and that should be
 
02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:23.109 align:start position:0%
agricultural issues and that should be
done

02:11:23.109 --> 02:11:23.119 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:11:26.229 --> 02:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
one annually say in november so that was
 
02:11:27.990 --> 02:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
the gist of the section the second
 
02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:29.109 align:start position:0%
the gist of the section the second
section

02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
what i'd like to do is
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
incorporate those ideas into
 
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
what representative schomburg has
 
02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:37.750 align:start position:0%
what representative schomburg has
presented

02:11:37.750 --> 02:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
presented
 
02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
and i think it's a very good idea
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
to insert this in chapter 425 of the
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
statutes because that deals with fund
 
02:11:49.189 --> 02:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
distributions to agricultural affairs so
 
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
02:11:55.270 --> 02:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
if you would do that
 
02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
okay sure
 
02:12:00.550 --> 02:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
we will uh we both agree
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
check this up on on
 
02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:03.990 align:start position:0%
check this up on on
monday

02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
monday
 
02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:09.830 align:start position:0%
monday
alrighty

02:12:09.830 --> 02:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:12.870 --> 02:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
and i'll try to i'll get a hold of karen
 
02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
and see if we can
 
02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:16.149 align:start position:0%
and see if we can
get

02:12:16.149 --> 02:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
they're also going to be meeting at the
 
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
same time unfortunately what's that
 
02:12:30.629 --> 02:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
they're going to be meeting at the same
 
02:12:31.990 --> 02:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
time so it's going to be a little
 
02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:33.430 align:start position:0%
time so it's going to be a little
difficult

02:12:33.430 --> 02:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
we can work that out
 
02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:43.189 align:start position:0%
we can work that out
yeah

02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:43.199 --> 02:12:47.510 align:start position:0%
 
now

02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:56.709 --> 02:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
what we have left is 1598
 
02:12:59.510 --> 02:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
plus this one
 
02:13:02.709 --> 02:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
we're going to deal with on monday
 
02:13:05.109 --> 02:13:05.119 align:start position:0%
i left it so that we could meet this
 
02:13:05.119 --> 02:13:06.950 align:start position:0%
i left it so that we could meet this
afternoon

02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:09.910 align:start position:0%
afternoon
but

02:13:09.910 --> 02:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:12.149 --> 02:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
do you think you've heard enough
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
we'll continue
 
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
thank you i think that uh we need to see
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
the full amendment that needs to come in
 
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
from uh from representative lang before
 
02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
we can really go any further we've we've
 
02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
beat the original bill to death as
 
02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
amended so uh i think once we get this
 
02:13:38.709 --> 02:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
amendment in we make the comparison to
 
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
what was and what is we know what we
 
02:13:41.589 --> 02:13:41.599 align:start position:0%
need to do
 
02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
thanks for reminding me and very
 
02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
important yeah um representative lange
 
02:13:49.589 --> 02:13:49.599 align:start position:0%
how long do you think it will take you
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
to go through
 
02:13:53.270 --> 02:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh going through it's going to be really
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
quick having the conversation after we
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
go through it might be a little bit more
 
02:13:57.750 --> 02:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
difficult so that
 
02:13:59.669 --> 02:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
again we've already identified at least
 
02:14:02.229 --> 02:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
two items that i in my amendment i have
 
02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
to go get redrafted uh one is the 15
 
02:14:06.950 --> 02:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
cultivators two is the eight months
 
02:14:08.950 --> 02:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh for rulemaking so i already know i
 
02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
need to change that why don't you pass
 
02:14:12.629 --> 02:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
out the amendment and let's go through
 
02:14:13.990 --> 02:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
it quickly
 
02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
and then we can chew on it over the
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
weekend uh ref said major i really need
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
to have a discussion about this idea of
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
spreading it to every small farm that
 
02:14:29.910 --> 02:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
might grow a patch of marijuana
 
02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:30.950 align:start position:0%
might grow a patch of marijuana
on

02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
it i think if you're going to do that we
 
02:14:35.589 --> 02:14:35.599 align:start position:0%
at least need i don't know if they're
 
02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
allowed to get involved with this but
 
02:14:41.030 --> 02:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
ask the the new hampshire at
 
02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
extension service yeah unh extensions
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
to to comment about whether this is at
 
02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
all feasible it is an annual crop
 
02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:52.550 align:start position:0%
all feasible it is an annual crop
it

02:14:52.550 --> 02:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
it is highly
 
02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:55.750 align:start position:0%
it is highly
uh

02:14:55.750 --> 02:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:59.589 --> 02:14:59.599 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to droughts to floods
 
02:15:01.750 --> 02:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
to bad harvesting
 
02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:04.870 align:start position:0%
to bad harvesting
to

02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:08.310 --> 02:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
the quality is the first thing in
 
02:15:11.270 --> 02:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
marijuana sales
 
02:15:13.030 --> 02:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative ames well i don't
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
understand much about this but my
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is that a lot of cannabis
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
is cultivated indoor indoors under
 
02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:21.669 align:start position:0%
is cultivated indoor indoors under
lights

02:15:21.669 --> 02:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
lights
 
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
anywhere in a house would be fine
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about small cultivators
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:15:30.709 --> 02:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
marijuana context we're
 
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
not talking about the traditional small
 
02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:39.510 --> 02:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative romney okay let's go all
 
02:15:40.550 --> 02:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
right so
 
02:15:42.629 --> 02:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
back to the marijuana commission
 
02:15:44.310 --> 02:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
guess who was in the room a lot in our
 
02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:45.589 align:start position:0%
guess who was in the room a lot in our
meetings

02:15:45.589 --> 02:15:45.599 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
02:15:45.599 --> 02:15:47.270 align:start position:0%
meetings
farmers

02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
farmers
 
02:15:48.950 --> 02:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh there's nothing in the bill that says
 
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
it has to be grown inside or outside
 
02:15:53.589 --> 02:15:53.599 align:start position:0%
there's no restrictions on it's a
 
02:15:55.189 --> 02:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
restriction of the 15 which i think we
 
02:15:57.350 --> 02:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
heard we have to lift that because let
 
02:15:59.109 --> 02:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
the marketplace
 
02:16:00.629 --> 02:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
and what when and i had a hallway
 
02:16:03.350 --> 02:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
conversation with the commissioner
 
02:16:06.870 --> 02:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh he did touch on this that in maine
 
02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
the liquor commissioner yeah
 
02:16:11.189 --> 02:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
so the liquor commissioner said
 
02:16:12.550 --> 02:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
and he's been doing his homework a bit
 
02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
here and he checked what's going on in
 
02:16:14.239 --> 02:16:15.189 align:start position:0%
here and he checked what's going on in
maine

02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
maine
 
02:16:17.189 --> 02:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of farm first but
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
what they do
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
is they put these we have a lot of that
 
02:16:22.149 --> 02:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
going on in new hampshire too there's
 
02:16:24.550 --> 02:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
the one place where in loudoun
 
02:16:25.990 --> 02:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
that grows
 
02:16:28.709 --> 02:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
lettuce and greens and things
 
02:16:31.589 --> 02:16:31.599 align:start position:0%
but it's but it's in the um you know and
 
02:16:34.309 --> 02:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
it's thin plastic okay right
 
02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
so that's what you see a lot of
 
02:16:38.469 --> 02:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
i think that's what he was talking about
 
02:16:39.990 --> 02:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's the way to do it so you can get
 
02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
more than
 
02:16:43.190 --> 02:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
one crop a year
 
02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:44.070 align:start position:0%
one crop a year
so

02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
and i
 
02:16:47.349 --> 02:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
to me the way the bill is written
 
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
and obviously we can amend it to a
 
02:16:51.190 --> 02:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
degree but but that's kind of so you
 
02:16:52.709 --> 02:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
know the cross over the policy and our
 
02:16:52.719 --> 02:16:53.830 align:start position:0%
know the cross over the policy and our
policy

02:16:53.830 --> 02:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:16:55.669 --> 02:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
where we're gonna we're gonna say i
 
02:16:57.429 --> 02:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
think we're gonna amend out the 15
 
02:16:57.439 --> 02:16:58.790 align:start position:0%
think we're gonna amend out the 15
because

02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:17:00.549 --> 02:17:00.559 align:start position:0%
15 is ridiculous for the number of
 
02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
stores so
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
that'll impact revenues because we're
 
02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
going to we're going to constrain the
 
02:17:06.150 --> 02:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
amount of supply could i ask you a
 
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
question i'm not sure i still don't
 
02:17:09.509 --> 02:17:09.519 align:start position:0%
understand why
 
02:17:12.389 --> 02:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
we if supply chain is a potential issue
 
02:17:13.830 --> 02:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
why aren't we growing our own in a very
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
controlled environment
 
02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
that wasn't okay
 
02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
to me it just seems like the logical way
 
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
to go in a vertically integrated system
 
02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
you grow your own greenhouses under
 
02:17:24.150 --> 02:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
lights whatever it is
 
02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
right yes i understand that but i'm just
 
02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about the control factor coming
 
02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
from 15 or 20 or 50 different farms from
 
02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
a from a true recreation model
 
02:17:35.589 --> 02:17:35.599 align:start position:0%
with commercialization it's a
 
02:17:37.190 --> 02:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
commercialization model most of these
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
companies are bigger
 
02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
and they have vertical integration and
 
02:17:42.389 --> 02:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
they make money all over every step of
 
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
the way from from growing to to
 
02:17:47.830 --> 02:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturing to retail
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
here we're actually putting our
 
02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:50.709 align:start position:0%
here we're actually putting our
week

02:17:50.709 --> 02:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
week
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
if we had that kind of model in the
 
02:17:53.190 --> 02:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
state i think we could make a lot more
 
02:17:54.629 --> 02:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
money here
 
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
i'm agreeing with you
 
02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:56.950 align:start position:0%
i'm agreeing with you
that

02:17:56.950 --> 02:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:17:58.230 --> 02:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
that we're not we're not going to make
 
02:18:00.389 --> 02:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
any money on the on the cultivation and
 
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
if manufacturing comes back into this
 
02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
bill we're not going to make anything on
 
02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:05.270 align:start position:0%
bill we're not going to make anything on
manufacturing

02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
02:18:06.389 --> 02:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
because those are going to be private
 
02:18:07.830 --> 02:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
business but this is the bill that was
 
02:18:10.389 --> 02:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
handed to us you know i understand this
 
02:18:13.349 --> 02:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
is and now that's a major amendment to
 
02:18:13.359 --> 02:18:14.230 align:start position:0%
is and now that's a major amendment to
say

02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:18:17.349 --> 02:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
oh no and he he's going to say
 
02:18:19.110 --> 02:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
we have no expertise in this it's what
 
02:18:20.790 --> 02:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
the commission is
 
02:18:22.469 --> 02:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
it's hard enough for him to do what he's
 
02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
about to do just do the retail
 
02:18:27.669 --> 02:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
because basically in his business
 
02:18:29.429 --> 02:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
he they have great experts at buying
 
02:18:31.349 --> 02:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
things but other manufacturers are doing
 
02:18:32.389 --> 02:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
all of that
 
02:18:34.549 --> 02:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
i just think about you know medicines in
 
02:18:36.709 --> 02:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
general if you bring in a product from
 
02:18:38.549 --> 02:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
all over the world that isn't controlled
 
02:18:39.910 --> 02:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
how do you control the end product
 
02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's why to me is more of a question
 
02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
of just the logic of having
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
multiple little farms versus growing
 
02:18:48.709 --> 02:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
your own under control regulated to get
 
02:18:50.790 --> 02:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
the the same product day in and day out
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
right but it's it's going to be more
 
02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:53.030 align:start position:0%
right but it's it's going to be more
than

02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
little farms it's going to be big and
 
02:18:56.150 --> 02:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's going to be
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
and if if a small farmer wants to give a
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
crack at it
 
02:19:01.190 --> 02:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know there'll be a license fee to do
 
02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:02.150 align:start position:0%
you know there'll be a license fee to do
it

02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
they can compete with everybody else
 
02:19:06.629 --> 02:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
but but you're right about the quality
 
02:19:08.950 --> 02:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
testing and that's you know i'm just
 
02:19:11.429 --> 02:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
trying to say you know let the market in
 
02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
the marijuana commission we said let the
 
02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:14.070 align:start position:0%
the marijuana commission we said let the
marketplace

02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
02:19:16.469 --> 02:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
sort that all out and we had a long
 
02:19:18.549 --> 02:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
conversation about this believe me
 
02:19:18.559 --> 02:19:19.349 align:start position:0%
conversation about this believe me
let's

02:19:19.349 --> 02:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
let's
 
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
because we talked about limitations on
 
02:19:22.629 --> 02:19:22.639 align:start position:0%
growers you know and all that and we
 
02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
said no you know something like any
 
02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
other new product
 
02:19:27.270 --> 02:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to start here in terms of the
 
02:19:28.629 --> 02:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
numbers that eventually come down it
 
02:19:31.349 --> 02:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
sounds like in mass and in maine
 
02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's growing still
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
so i don't know
 
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
we have to remember
 
02:19:39.750 --> 02:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
that the policy has been set
 
02:19:40.950 --> 02:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
two to one
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
by the full house
 
02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
and we
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
have to concentrate only on the revenue
 
02:19:48.389 --> 02:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
02:19:53.990 --> 02:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:55.590 --> 02:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative allow me i i'd like to
 
02:19:58.469 --> 02:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
address your question about um if i may
 
02:19:59.750 --> 02:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
02:20:02.950 --> 02:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
about the way that it grows we had
 
02:20:04.870 --> 02:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
testimony and fortunately i have a
 
02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
little experience in my background with
 
02:20:09.750 --> 02:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
this uh we had testimony from
 
02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
the folks from the atc's who
 
02:20:13.670 --> 02:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
talked about the fact that sometimes
 
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
they turn over three to four crops per
 
02:20:16.080 --> 02:20:17.110 align:start position:0%
they turn over three to four crops per
year

02:20:17.110 --> 02:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay it's in but you wouldn't want to
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
grow this outside
 
02:20:24.150 --> 02:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
because if it was outside then people
 
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
could come onto your property and take
 
02:20:27.270 --> 02:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
it and you have better security if it's
 
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
inside if it's in a grow house in a
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
plastic grow house you can provide all
 
02:20:32.550 --> 02:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
the security you need to that grow house
 
02:20:33.990 --> 02:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
your product is is secure and safe and
 
02:20:39.910 --> 02:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
quality and used uh without pesticides
 
02:20:44.070 --> 02:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
could i just say something to that
 
02:20:46.880 --> 02:20:48.150 align:start position:0%
could i just say something to that
on

02:20:48.150 --> 02:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:20:51.990 --> 02:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
i think if we put into here something
 
02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:52.950 align:start position:0%
i think if we put into here something
which

02:20:52.950 --> 02:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
maybe policy but it also quality is
 
02:20:59.270 --> 02:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
revenue in this case
 
02:21:01.349 --> 02:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise they're gonna they're gonna
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
our people are gonna continue going to
 
02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:04.469 align:start position:0%
our people are gonna continue going to
massachusetts

02:21:04.469 --> 02:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
02:21:04.479 --> 02:21:06.950 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
on

02:21:06.950 --> 02:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
that if we put something in that said
 
02:21:13.590 --> 02:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
that it shall only be grown
 
02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:14.870 align:start position:0%
that it shall only be grown
inside

02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
inside
 
02:21:17.030 --> 02:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know exactly how you'd say
 
02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:19.270 align:start position:0%
i don't know exactly how you'd say
inside

02:21:19.270 --> 02:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
inside
 
02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
then that will make it
 
02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
incredibly easier for this
 
02:21:26.630 --> 02:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
negotiator or whatever
 
02:21:28.710 --> 02:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
his title is
 
02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:29.590 align:start position:0%
his title is
uh

02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
to actually produce decent quality and
 
02:21:35.349 --> 02:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
and consistent quality
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
you would say under the uv lights
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
under under the under well under the
 
02:21:42.389 --> 02:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
lights it could be outside if you're
 
02:21:46.150 --> 02:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
willing to only do two crops a year
 
02:21:46.160 --> 02:21:47.429 align:start position:0%
willing to only do two crops a year
but

02:21:47.429 --> 02:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:21:47.439 --> 02:21:48.309 align:start position:0%
but
on

02:21:48.309 --> 02:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
at least on
 
02:21:53.190 --> 02:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
at that way you aren't worrying about
 
02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
drought you aren't worrying about about
 
02:21:57.190 --> 02:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
animals coming in and defecating on it
 
02:21:59.429 --> 02:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
you're talking about all sorts of things
 
02:22:01.510 --> 02:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and representative
 
02:22:03.270 --> 02:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
before i was a legislator i worked with
 
02:22:05.030 --> 02:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
the u.s virgin islands helping them
 
02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
craft their medical marijuana policy and
 
02:22:08.950 --> 02:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
how they would grow it on the island and
 
02:22:10.790 --> 02:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
of course there they have 12 full hours
 
02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
of sun every day
 
02:22:12.319 --> 02:22:13.110 align:start position:0%
of sun every day
and

02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:15.270 --> 02:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
many of their
 
02:22:19.110 --> 02:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
many of their crops are grown outdoors
 
02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
because they have the sunlight and the
 
02:22:24.710 --> 02:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
needed sunlight that it takes in order
 
02:22:27.270 --> 02:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
to grow a crop and turn over a crop more
 
02:22:29.429 --> 02:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
than once annually
 
02:22:32.070 --> 02:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
and um having said that
 
02:22:35.270 --> 02:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
in a grow house or in a in a greenhouse
 
02:22:37.990 --> 02:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
you would put up um a hoop house with uh
 
02:22:41.270 --> 02:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know plastic over it you can control
 
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh the amount of crop the what you're
 
02:22:45.750 --> 02:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
going to deliver for crops whatever you
 
02:22:48.469 --> 02:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
determine three to four a year sometimes
 
02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
you can get four i know you can get
 
02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:51.110 align:start position:0%
you can get four i know you can get
three

02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:22:51.120 --> 02:22:51.910 align:start position:0%
three
um

02:22:51.910 --> 02:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
indoors inside a greenhouse
 
02:22:57.510 --> 02:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh so with lights
 
02:22:59.190 --> 02:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
with lights yes with lights and
 
02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes without lights i mean you
 
02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't have to have the lights on all the
 
02:23:04.870 --> 02:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
time in the middle of summer yes yes
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
let's just talk about pesticides you all
 
02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
quick though
 
02:23:09.429 --> 02:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
kidding okay hold on mr chair if i made
 
02:23:13.270 --> 02:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
it represent aaron and representative
 
02:23:14.870 --> 02:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm kind of confused about the point
 
02:23:20.630 --> 02:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
where we talk about
 
02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
we're only looking at the
 
02:23:24.469 --> 02:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
financial aspects of this bill and not
 
02:23:27.429 --> 02:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
the policy aspects and yet
 
02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
much of the policy aspects really has a
 
02:23:32.469 --> 02:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
big bearing on the financial aspects
 
02:23:32.479 --> 02:23:34.070 align:start position:0%
big bearing on the financial aspects
because

02:23:34.070 --> 02:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
here we're talking about well
 
02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
do we make changes to make this more
 
02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
profitable for the state such as adding
 
02:23:41.040 --> 02:23:42.309 align:start position:0%
profitable for the state such as adding
edibles

02:23:42.309 --> 02:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
edibles
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
do we make
 
02:23:48.070 --> 02:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
changes to how many suppliers we can
 
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
specify and how many licenses the state
 
02:23:50.560 --> 02:23:51.429 align:start position:0%
specify and how many licenses the state
can

02:23:51.429 --> 02:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:23:54.469 --> 02:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
provide so i i do think to some extent
 
02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
that we are making some sort of
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
alterations to policy in order to make
 
02:24:00.389 --> 02:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
this work financially
 
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
is that true okay
 
02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to be difficult to separate
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
the two
 
02:24:08.630 --> 02:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
but the edibles has been
 
02:24:10.950 --> 02:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
has been debated
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
and it's been excluded
 
02:24:16.469 --> 02:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
but the number of suppliers
 
02:24:17.429 --> 02:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:24:20.469 --> 02:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
we could change that
 
02:24:23.270 --> 02:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
continue if you've got more questions
 
02:24:28.469 --> 02:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
um no i i'm just
 
02:24:30.710 --> 02:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
i'm just sort of struggling with this
 
02:24:34.150 --> 02:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
issue of um separating out policy from
 
02:24:36.950 --> 02:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
the finances because they are so much
 
02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
intertwined and we do want to make this
 
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
craft this
 
02:24:43.030 --> 02:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
any amendments to make this bill
 
02:24:45.429 --> 02:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
stronger in terms of the argument that
 
02:24:48.070 --> 02:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
this is going to be
 
02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
a a worthwhile financial endeavor for
 
02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
the state to embark upon right and i
 
02:24:54.399 --> 02:24:55.990 align:start position:0%
the state to embark upon right and i
agree

02:24:55.990 --> 02:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
agree
 
02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
for the state to make more money edibles
 
02:24:59.830 --> 02:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
should be in there
 
02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
but i think the policy has been set on
 
02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:05.270 align:start position:0%
but i think the policy has been set on
that

02:25:05.270 --> 02:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:06.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:25:06.630 --> 02:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i i guess
 
02:25:09.990 --> 02:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to get into the amendment so
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
everyone can take it home and read it
 
02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
for the weekend but i will just make
 
02:25:14.710 --> 02:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
this statement for me the underlying
 
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
policy was legalization
 
02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's the what that's the policy
 
02:25:21.190 --> 02:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
everything else is the how and the how
 
02:25:23.270 --> 02:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
is up to us to a certain extent that's
 
02:25:25.510 --> 02:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
the way i view this is that the wad is
 
02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
fine we've legalized it now the question
 
02:25:29.429 --> 02:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
is how do we go about doing that and
 
02:25:31.670 --> 02:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
that has revenue implications and that's
 
02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
why we can have discussions around how
 
02:25:34.630 --> 02:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
many cultivators there are and those
 
02:25:37.110 --> 02:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
kind of things it gets to the to the how
 
02:25:38.950 --> 02:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
so that's the way i view this and that's
 
02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
why in drafting some of this stuff i'm
 
02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at it that way i like that
 
02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
so if i get into the amendment
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
so everybody can kind of get a sense of
 
02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
what it looks like there were some
 
02:25:51.510 --> 02:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
significant changes yes um
 
02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:53.030 align:start position:0%
significant changes yes um
so

02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:25:54.630 --> 02:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
i'm going to start on the first real
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
change is on page five
 
02:25:58.230 --> 02:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
 
02:25:58.240 --> 02:26:00.469 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
um

02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:00.479 --> 02:26:01.190 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
i have a i already have the draft to
 
02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
change page five line 28. this is about
 
02:26:08.630 --> 02:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
the regulations and to representative
 
02:26:10.469 --> 02:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
ames point i added the word licensure on
 
02:26:11.910 --> 02:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
line 30
 
02:26:14.309 --> 02:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
and i have a new amendment version going
 
02:26:17.429 --> 02:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
sorry a little slower i apologize okay
 
02:26:22.870 --> 02:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
page five line
 
02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:25.429 align:start position:0%
page five line
[Music]

02:26:25.429 --> 02:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:26:30.230 --> 02:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
yeah they ols the health committee
 
02:26:34.309 --> 02:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
services stapled it backwards so
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
apologize for that although it does make
 
02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
it easy to read
 
02:26:39.670 --> 02:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
um until page five yeah well and you're
 
02:26:58.550 --> 02:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:01.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:03.190 --> 02:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
so at page five so if you pull up page
 
02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:04.070 align:start position:0%
so at page five so if you pull up page
five

02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
five
 
02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
we're on line 28
 
02:27:09.030 --> 02:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
so based on the committee conversation
 
02:27:10.950 --> 02:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
today i'm going to change that december
 
02:27:12.070 --> 02:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
1 for
 
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
december 1 2022 to read
 
02:27:16.950 --> 02:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
eight months after the passage of this
 
02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:18.630 align:start position:0%
eight months after the passage of this
bill

02:27:18.630 --> 02:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
so it gives the committee so once the
 
02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
governor signs it the clock starts
 
02:27:22.630 --> 02:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
ticking they have eight months from
 
02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:28.550 --> 02:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's line 28 where it says december
 
02:27:31.030 --> 02:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
1st 22 i'm going to change that take the
 
02:27:32.630 --> 02:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
date out and say no later than eight
 
02:27:36.630 --> 02:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:41.190 --> 02:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:42.309 --> 02:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to discuss it on
 
02:27:43.590 --> 02:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
monday i think i'm just trying to get it
 
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
to everybody so everybody can know what
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:53.349 --> 02:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to just
 
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss
 
02:27:56.830 --> 02:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
the length on
 
02:27:59.429 --> 02:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
monday on line 30 at representative ames
 
02:28:01.590 --> 02:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
request we added registration licensure
 
02:28:03.030 --> 02:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
and regulation so i added the word
 
02:28:06.389 --> 02:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:09.510 --> 02:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
page five line 30 number roman numeral
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
number one it says we added the word
 
02:28:15.910 --> 02:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
licensure before it's before it just
 
02:28:18.469 --> 02:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
said registration and regulation and we
 
02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
added regulation uh registration
 
02:28:23.110 --> 02:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
licensure and regulation right this this
 
02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
was from the subcommittee that was from
 
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee there was a request for
 
02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:28.389 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee there was a request for
representatives

02:28:28.389 --> 02:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
02:28:28.399 --> 02:28:28.870 align:start position:0%
representatives
um

02:28:28.870 --> 02:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:30.389 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

02:28:30.389 --> 02:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
what else would i get next the next one
 
02:28:34.469 --> 02:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
is on page seven and this is a mistake
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
that drafting is fixing
 
02:28:38.630 --> 02:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh so we'll come out in the new bill on
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
line number three of page seven roman
 
02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:42.469 align:start position:0%
line number three of page seven roman
numeral

02:28:42.469 --> 02:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
numeral
 
02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
four six there
 
02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
um what that meant to say but they made
 
02:28:49.510 --> 02:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
it that the atc's become retail stores
 
02:28:51.429 --> 02:28:51.439 align:start position:0%
and that wasn't what we intended
 
02:28:55.110 --> 02:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
um what we intended to do was to allow
 
02:28:58.230 --> 02:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
the atcs to be able to get a parallel
 
02:29:00.790 --> 02:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
license for cultivation
 
02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:02.309 align:start position:0%
license for cultivation
manufacture

02:29:02.309 --> 02:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
manufacture
 
02:29:03.990 --> 02:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
transportation of cannabis so that they
 
02:29:08.150 --> 02:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
could sell to the state because under
 
02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
the current rules they can't do that so
 
02:29:11.830 --> 02:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
we have to amend the law to allow them
 
02:29:13.590 --> 02:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to sell to the state because
 
02:29:16.630 --> 02:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
of their not-for-profit status
 
02:29:18.710 --> 02:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
that is well it's gonna show up in on
 
02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
page seven line three roman numeral six
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
it says the alternative treatment center
 
02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
is registered to operate on pursuant to
 
02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
rsa blah blah blah this says that
 
02:29:29.830 --> 02:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh shall obtain a separate registration
 
02:29:31.830 --> 02:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
to operate a cannabis establishment
 
02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this chapter and yet we
 
02:29:36.550 --> 02:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
meant to say they could be cultivators
 
02:29:40.710 --> 02:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
um manufacturers and um
 
02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
delivery agents so that was in response
 
02:29:45.349 --> 02:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
to their concern about being harmed and
 
02:29:47.190 --> 02:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
you were going to say if they said that
 
02:29:49.750 --> 02:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
they could sell as well then that
 
02:29:52.230 --> 02:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't hurt their atc therapeutic
 
02:29:54.309 --> 02:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
model correct it was an olive branch yes
 
02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
it was an olive branch to that
 
02:29:57.190 --> 02:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
organization to give them an another
 
02:29:58.630 --> 02:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
revenue stream to keep them healthy
 
02:30:01.110 --> 02:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
right okay they actually had no position
 
02:30:02.309 --> 02:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
02:30:04.469 --> 02:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding on that
 
02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
correct committee
 
02:30:07.510 --> 02:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
or can i
 
02:30:07.520 --> 02:30:14.070 align:start position:0%
or can i
well

02:30:14.070 --> 02:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
right right right but we'll talk to them
 
02:30:17.590 --> 02:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
we can talk about it so then if we go
 
02:30:19.590 --> 02:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
over to page eight
 
02:30:21.429 --> 02:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
so this is where the banking language
 
02:30:22.950 --> 02:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
was originally in this bill and we
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
struck all of the banking language that
 
02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
was originally put into the bill however
 
02:30:29.190 --> 02:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
we did add some language in here about
 
02:30:32.070 --> 02:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
banking and one of it had to do with
 
02:30:33.750 --> 02:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
if you look at line
 
02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:35.670 align:start position:0%
if you look at line
18

02:30:35.670 --> 02:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
18
 
02:30:37.110 --> 02:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
the big thing is we just we talk about
 
02:30:38.790 --> 02:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
having to separate the funds from
 
02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis from all other state funds so
 
02:30:42.389 --> 02:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
if something happens we're not putting
 
02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
the entire general fund at risk
 
02:30:46.790 --> 02:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
somehow because it's co-mingled monies
 
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
um and so it talks about the fact that
 
02:30:50.550 --> 02:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
the um the money's being credited to a
 
02:30:52.469 --> 02:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
fund that will be held distinct and
 
02:30:54.550 --> 02:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
separate from all other funds
 
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
um under the straight treasurer's
 
02:30:58.870 --> 02:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
control so is that a one a roman that's
 
02:31:01.750 --> 02:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
1a okay they're cannabis control fund
 
02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
correct under under yeah starting on
 
02:31:05.830 --> 02:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
line 18 number one
 
02:31:06.870 --> 02:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh a
 
02:31:08.710 --> 02:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
the languages we added some language in
 
02:31:10.550 --> 02:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
air just to keep the funds separate you
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
got this language from the
 
02:31:13.349 --> 02:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire bankers
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
association from the association and i
 
02:31:16.710 --> 02:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
ran it by the liquor commission they
 
02:31:19.270 --> 02:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
were completely okay with it right okay
 
02:31:22.309 --> 02:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
and then b is also a mechanism to take
 
02:31:24.550 --> 02:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
money out of there for the state if
 
02:31:27.590 --> 02:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
there is ever enough money we'll get the
 
02:31:28.950 --> 02:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
disbursements a little bit later in the
 
02:31:28.960 --> 02:31:30.550 align:start position:0%
disbursements a little bit later in the
amendment

02:31:30.550 --> 02:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
um the second line again is is just some
 
02:31:35.349 --> 02:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
banking language to clean up um to make
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
sure the state's doing it right we
 
02:31:39.510 --> 02:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
talked about with the finn sin
 
02:31:40.790 --> 02:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
and the flag
 
02:31:42.870 --> 02:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
page what line again we're on the same
 
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
page page eight the next section b
 
02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
not withstanding and provision of lower
 
02:31:48.950 --> 02:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
contrary financial institutions with a
 
02:31:50.550 --> 02:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
branch within the state so again minor
 
02:31:52.550 --> 02:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
banking language it again was from the
 
02:31:54.150 --> 02:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire banking association that
 
02:31:55.990 --> 02:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
would clean up the language and also i
 
02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
ran this by liquor commission and they
 
02:32:01.750 --> 02:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay now we get into a disbursement of
 
02:32:05.670 --> 02:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
funds from this fund
 
02:32:05.680 --> 02:32:06.870 align:start position:0%
funds from this fund
um

02:32:06.870 --> 02:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
so where's that same same page we're at
 
02:32:11.349 --> 02:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
line we're going to start at line number
 
02:32:13.110 --> 02:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
30 and i just want to have before we
 
02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
start reading the actual bill i want to
 
02:32:16.070 --> 02:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
tell you exactly what i did and then
 
02:32:17.510 --> 02:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
i'll show you how the chat how it plays
 
02:32:17.520 --> 02:32:18.230 align:start position:0%
i'll show you how the chat how it plays
out

02:32:18.230 --> 02:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:32:20.070 --> 02:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
under the original bill the first
 
02:32:22.469 --> 02:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
disbursement we made was to pay back the
 
02:32:25.190 --> 02:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayers for the startup costs
 
02:32:26.630 --> 02:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit of problem with that is
 
02:32:28.389 --> 02:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
that they need to be able to operate so
 
02:32:29.910 --> 02:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
it didn't take enough money in and we
 
02:32:31.190 --> 02:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
used all the money to pay back the state
 
02:32:32.630 --> 02:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
they had no money to run the rest of the
 
02:32:35.750 --> 02:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
stores for any time so i inverted number
 
02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
one and two and i said the first thing
 
02:32:38.630 --> 02:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
they do is get to take their operational
 
02:32:41.030 --> 02:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
operation expenses out then they'll pay
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
back the citizens
 
02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh we're at we're on page eight line
 
02:32:45.520 --> 02:32:46.710 align:start position:0%
uh we're at we're on page eight line
thirty

02:32:46.710 --> 02:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
thirty
 
02:32:46.720 --> 02:32:47.590 align:start position:0%
thirty
thirty

02:32:47.590 --> 02:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
thirty
 
02:32:49.429 --> 02:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
and i'm just reading it it'll start it
 
02:32:51.349 --> 02:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
it all runs right starting at thirty
 
02:32:52.790 --> 02:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
everything i'm saying will run down from
 
02:32:55.270 --> 02:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
there on to page nine but i just want to
 
02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
explain what i did so you have to read
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
every language we can fix the language
 
02:32:59.830 --> 02:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
later if you don't like it um so the
 
02:33:01.830 --> 02:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
first thing i did was invert the payment
 
02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
to the citizens the general fund back
 
02:33:05.349 --> 02:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
for the startup cost with the operating
 
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
costs so the first line is they get to
 
02:33:08.150 --> 02:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
take their operating costs out which
 
02:33:09.750 --> 02:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
allows them to be able to use that as a
 
02:33:11.590 --> 02:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
revolving fund to be able to
 
02:33:13.030 --> 02:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
add funds into their operational
 
02:33:15.190 --> 02:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
expenses to open the next store and so
 
02:33:16.389 --> 02:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
they can get to their stores without
 
02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
having to take another loan from the
 
02:33:19.910 --> 02:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
state to open more stores so they can
 
02:33:21.750 --> 02:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
use their operating revenues to be able
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
to slowly roll out more stores after the
 
02:33:26.309 --> 02:33:26.319 align:start position:0%
initial expenditure
 
02:33:28.950 --> 02:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
i did put um at the
 
02:33:30.790 --> 02:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation of ols that they have a
 
02:33:32.830 --> 02:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
five-year timeline to pay back the
 
02:33:35.349 --> 02:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
citizens so they have five years to pay
 
02:33:37.190 --> 02:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
back the money that we use to get we
 
02:33:39.190 --> 02:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
give them to start the uh start the ball
 
02:33:39.200 --> 02:33:40.309 align:start position:0%
give them to start the uh start the ball
rolling

02:33:40.309 --> 02:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
rolling
 
02:33:43.510 --> 02:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
and that's in line um
 
02:33:46.309 --> 02:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
that's on line 35 no later than
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
june 30 to 2027 the commission shall
 
02:33:50.710 --> 02:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
reimburse the general fund so again it's
 
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
a no later then so that if they get all
 
02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
their stores up in three years and the
 
02:33:55.990 --> 02:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
next year they have they're flush with
 
02:33:57.750 --> 02:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
cash they can pay the whole thing off in
 
02:33:59.110 --> 02:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
the fourth year and it's done but they
 
02:34:00.630 --> 02:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
have to have it done by the fifth year
 
02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
and they can interject so mr chair so
 
02:34:05.429 --> 02:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
you did this because
 
02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
the they requested while in the bill it
 
02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
was 14 million
 
02:34:11.349 --> 02:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
actually they the liquor commission
 
02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
thought it should have been even more
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
14 million now became 5 million or four
 
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
point whatever
 
02:34:19.190 --> 02:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
and that that uh
 
02:34:22.389 --> 02:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
and that the only way we can finance
 
02:34:24.950 --> 02:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
the new stores was to do this to give
 
02:34:27.429 --> 02:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
them time to pay back the initial loan
 
02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
right and it gives them lets them use
 
02:34:31.030 --> 02:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
their operating revenue that they create
 
02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
to be able to open more stores until we
 
02:34:33.990 --> 02:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
get the full
 
02:34:36.150 --> 02:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
10 and then we're at our full-blown 50
 
02:34:38.070 --> 02:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars or whatever 30 million
 
02:34:39.429 --> 02:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
dollars in revenue and they'll easily be
 
02:34:40.790 --> 02:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
able to pay the citizens back but it was
 
02:34:42.790 --> 02:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
a it's like any startup business right
 
02:34:44.150 --> 02:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
you got to have some revenue coming in
 
02:34:45.349 --> 02:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
if you want to grow
 
02:34:46.469 --> 02:34:46.479 align:start position:0%
you know so we got to give them that
 
02:34:47.990 --> 02:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
ability to grow to get where where they
 
02:34:49.750 --> 02:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:50.790 align:start position:0%
need to be
um

02:34:50.790 --> 02:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
so that's that as we roll into page
 
02:34:55.030 --> 02:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
eight now or nine
 
02:34:57.910 --> 02:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
so in the first two sections on on page
 
02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
eight we allow them to
 
02:35:01.270 --> 02:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
take out their operating expense and
 
02:35:02.870 --> 02:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
then pay back the state within five
 
02:35:02.880 --> 02:35:03.750 align:start position:0%
then pay back the state within five
years

02:35:03.750 --> 02:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:35:06.389 --> 02:35:06.399 align:start position:0%
now we have what i consider the we had
 
02:35:07.750 --> 02:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
the gross net which is what we were
 
02:35:09.270 --> 02:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
talking about there now we come to the
 
02:35:10.389 --> 02:35:10.399 align:start position:0%
net net
 
02:35:11.990 --> 02:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
this is after we've taken the
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
operational expense out any monies that
 
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
we decide to pay back to the general
 
02:35:17.190 --> 02:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
fund we have this new revenue
 
02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
that total and um uh
 
02:35:23.750 --> 02:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
so from that revenue total the net net
 
02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:24.710 align:start position:0%
so from that revenue total the net net
um

02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:26.230 align:start position:0%
um
50

02:35:26.230 --> 02:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
50
 
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
um of those of the funds that are left
 
02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
will go to offset this the 363 million
 
02:35:35.270 --> 02:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
dollars we raise for the swept tax
 
02:35:37.270 --> 02:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry line three
 
02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
starting at line three yes i'm sorry yep
 
02:35:40.389 --> 02:35:40.399 align:start position:0%
line three page nine
 
02:35:41.910 --> 02:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
so fifty percent of the remaining
 
02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
balance will be dispersed annually the
 
02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
department of revenue to be dispersed
 
02:35:46.230 --> 02:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns to offset the
 
02:35:48.550 --> 02:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
educational property tax imposed by on
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
persons blah blah blah so again the idea
 
02:35:52.230 --> 02:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:35:53.830 --> 02:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
i'll use some simple round numbers if we
 
02:35:55.670 --> 02:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
had 50 million dollars
 
02:35:57.670 --> 02:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
we would take 25 million dollars we
 
02:35:59.349 --> 02:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
immediately lower what was needed to be
 
02:36:02.389 --> 02:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
raised by taxation from swept from 363
 
02:36:05.510 --> 02:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars down to 363 minus 25
 
02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
million so we raised less money on the
 
02:36:10.150 --> 02:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
individual citizens that on the prop on
 
02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
the swept property tax line just just uh
 
02:36:13.680 --> 02:36:14.469 align:start position:0%
the swept property tax line just just uh
note

02:36:14.469 --> 02:36:14.479 align:start position:0%
note
 
02:36:16.070 --> 02:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
because we'll be discussing this on
 
02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:17.190 align:start position:0%
because we'll be discussing this on
monday

02:36:17.190 --> 02:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
monday
 
02:36:20.389 --> 02:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
that i do not think that's a wise
 
02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
allocation it skews heavily towards the
 
02:36:26.150 --> 02:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
property wealthy towns
 
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh maltenborough will get gobs of cash
 
02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:31.110 align:start position:0%
uh maltenborough will get gobs of cash
and

02:36:31.110 --> 02:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:34.309 --> 02:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
charlestown and jeffrey will get very
 
02:36:36.550 --> 02:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
little okay so you have that comment i
 
02:36:37.830 --> 02:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
knew i knew that was going to be a
 
02:36:39.750 --> 02:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
conversation point uh but again that's
 
02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:42.870 align:start position:0%
conversation point uh but again that's
that's

02:36:42.870 --> 02:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:44.389 --> 02:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
so we can talk i actually don't know
 
02:36:45.750 --> 02:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
numbers i don't wha
 
02:36:46.950 --> 02:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative ames and i talked about
 
02:36:48.230 --> 02:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
this i don't want to get bogged down in
 
02:36:49.670 --> 02:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
the conversation but i'm a little
 
02:36:51.110 --> 02:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
confused how that plays out a little bit
 
02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:52.469 align:start position:0%
confused how that plays out a little bit
myself

02:36:52.469 --> 02:36:52.479 align:start position:0%
myself
 
02:36:53.990 --> 02:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
so we can talk about that later let me
 
02:36:55.830 --> 02:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
stop this right now
 
02:36:58.150 --> 02:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
we're here to listen to where the
 
02:37:00.389 --> 02:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
changes are and what they are
 
02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
and then so that we can
 
02:37:06.790 --> 02:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
understand these over the weekend and
 
02:37:09.110 --> 02:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
come back monday and then move on
 
02:37:10.950 --> 02:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
questions and comments thank you mr
 
02:37:13.750 --> 02:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
chair so the next change is we allocated
 
02:37:15.990 --> 02:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
30 percent of the net net
 
02:37:17.670 --> 02:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
to pay off the new hampshire retirement
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
system debt
 
02:37:21.990 --> 02:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
to try to expedite that faster
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
which would be a huge benefit to our
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
cities and towns if we can get there
 
02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:26.070 align:start position:0%
cities and towns if we can get there
quicker

02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
quicker
 
02:37:28.230 --> 02:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
less less interest we pay on that debt
 
02:37:29.270 --> 02:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
the more
 
02:37:31.590 --> 02:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
and immediately both the towns and the
 
02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
employees would see a benefit because
 
02:37:35.590 --> 02:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
their percentage of retirement costs
 
02:37:37.670 --> 02:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
would drop and that would result in more
 
02:37:39.670 --> 02:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
money in their paycheck versus going to
 
02:37:42.389 --> 02:37:42.399 align:start position:0%
retirement so we allocated 30 percent of
 
02:37:44.230 --> 02:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
those funds that are remaining to go to
 
02:37:45.670 --> 02:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire retirement system debt
 
02:37:48.150 --> 02:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
specifically and once we pay off that
 
02:37:49.910 --> 02:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
debt three that 30 percent will go
 
02:37:53.510 --> 02:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
directly to the education trust fund
 
02:37:56.070 --> 02:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
the next item is 10
 
02:37:58.790 --> 02:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
or 25 million whichever is less so we
 
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
get to the point where we're making 200
 
02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
and or 300 million dollars in net net
 
02:38:07.670 --> 02:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
which would be great
 
02:38:10.230 --> 02:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
dhhs would the cessation programs would
 
02:38:13.270 --> 02:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
be held to a 25 million dollar cap
 
02:38:15.510 --> 02:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
but we also allow it so as the program
 
02:38:17.990 --> 02:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
ramps up dhhs in theory would have more
 
02:38:19.510 --> 02:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
need and therefore they would get more
 
02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:20.469 align:start position:0%
need and therefore they would get more
money

02:38:20.469 --> 02:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:38:22.309 --> 02:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
as the program ramps up the money to
 
02:38:24.790 --> 02:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
dhhs would ramp up
 
02:38:26.710 --> 02:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
the last two item the last two five
 
02:38:28.469 --> 02:38:28.479 align:start position:0%
percents are five percent will go to
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
public safety agencies again the
 
02:38:32.309 --> 02:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
anticipation here is things like police
 
02:38:33.750 --> 02:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
standards and training council would be
 
02:38:34.870 --> 02:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
able to offer
 
02:38:37.429 --> 02:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
drug recognition expert classes to allow
 
02:38:38.790 --> 02:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers to better
 
02:38:41.110 --> 02:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
understand what does drug driving look
 
02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:42.389 align:start position:0%
understand what does drug driving look
like

02:38:42.389 --> 02:38:42.399 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:38:44.230 --> 02:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
and be able to recognize those kind of
 
02:38:45.429 --> 02:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
symptoms and the problems that are
 
02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
coming up
 
02:38:49.110 --> 02:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
and the last one is five percent which
 
02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
is the last five percent of the net net
 
02:38:52.630 --> 02:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh shall be dispersed the department
 
02:38:54.389 --> 02:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
health and human services behavioral
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
health um bureau of children children's
 
02:38:59.590 --> 02:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
behavioral health to be used why we need
 
02:39:02.630 --> 02:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
finance with us on monday right so and i
 
02:39:04.230 --> 02:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
ran these again i ran all of this by
 
02:39:06.309 --> 02:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
finance um and they actually really
 
02:39:07.429 --> 02:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
loved the idea we were giving new
 
02:39:08.790 --> 02:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire retirement system money to pay
 
02:39:10.389 --> 02:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
that debt off faster
 
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:15.990 --> 02:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
just a clarification question so if
 
02:39:18.550 --> 02:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
you've just allocated 100
 
02:39:20.469 --> 02:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
where's the money to open a new store so
 
02:39:22.230 --> 02:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
that's the net net so we talked about
 
02:39:24.070 --> 02:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
gross debt the top we start with the
 
02:39:25.830 --> 02:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
gross net which is 50 million dollars if
 
02:39:27.670 --> 02:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
we use their original numbers
 
02:39:29.190 --> 02:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
right the first thing we take out of
 
02:39:30.710 --> 02:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
that is their operating expense the
 
02:39:32.469 --> 02:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
second thing we take out of that any any
 
02:39:33.910 --> 02:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
dollar amount they want to use to pay
 
02:39:35.670 --> 02:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
off the startup and now you're left with
 
02:39:37.670 --> 02:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
the net net now we're doing percentage
 
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:44.550 --> 02:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
just ask on that i thought that what you
 
02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:45.349 align:start position:0%
just ask on that i thought that what you
did

02:39:45.349 --> 02:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
did
 
02:39:47.910 --> 02:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
was stop taking out money for the new
 
02:39:50.830 --> 02:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
stores after night
 
02:39:53.030 --> 02:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
after uh
 
02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:54.950 align:start position:0%
after uh
27.

02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
27.
 
02:39:56.870 --> 02:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
no they have to pay back the startup
 
02:39:59.349 --> 02:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
costs to the to the general fund by
 
02:39:59.359 --> 02:40:01.750 align:start position:0%
costs to the to the general fund by
2027.

02:40:01.750 --> 02:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
2027.
 
02:40:04.469 --> 02:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
but then anything that they want to keep
 
02:40:06.870 --> 02:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
to open new stores
 
02:40:08.870 --> 02:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
which is something we've seen a lot with
 
02:40:11.030 --> 02:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
liquor that they
 
02:40:13.590 --> 02:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
that our revenues go down because they
 
02:40:16.550 --> 02:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
they open new stores so if i made the
 
02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
way i understand we do current liquor
 
02:40:20.469 --> 02:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
stores is that they do it out of their
 
02:40:22.389 --> 02:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
operating costs so they don't they
 
02:40:23.830 --> 02:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
collect their revenue and then they
 
02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
project out we want to open this store
 
02:40:26.710 --> 02:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
it's good we're going to charge this
 
02:40:28.230 --> 02:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
expense it would go to their operating
 
02:40:29.990 --> 02:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
expenses so it would come out of the
 
02:40:31.510 --> 02:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
first line when they open a store it's
 
02:40:33.110 --> 02:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
going to be part of the operating
 
02:40:34.710 --> 02:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
expenses they're deducting out of the
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
gross net exactly but it does
 
02:40:40.469 --> 02:40:40.479 align:start position:0%
continually come out we will discuss
 
02:40:42.630 --> 02:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
that on monday
 
02:40:45.990 --> 02:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
the next change is on page 9 line 33 and
 
02:40:47.510 --> 02:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
this is where we had the that just the
 
02:40:50.550 --> 02:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
typo they had um temporary investigators
 
02:40:51.830 --> 02:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
something like that and i'd change it to
 
02:40:55.110 --> 02:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
market consultants on line 33. and that
 
02:40:56.150 --> 02:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
is the
 
02:41:00.790 --> 02:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:02.870 --> 02:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
no they wanted market consultants they
 
02:41:05.349 --> 02:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
were okay with that actually
 
02:41:07.910 --> 02:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
negotiate was apparently
 
02:41:11.030 --> 02:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
all also doing all of the
 
02:41:13.110 --> 02:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:41:15.510 --> 02:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
visiting of the farms and making sure
 
02:41:17.110 --> 02:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:41:18.710 --> 02:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
their quality was
 
02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:19.990 align:start position:0%
their quality was
sufficient

02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
02:41:21.510 --> 02:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
again the marketing consultants may do
 
02:41:24.070 --> 02:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
all of that that's within whatever so
 
02:41:25.750 --> 02:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
the all the bill does is allow them to
 
02:41:27.990 --> 02:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
create an rfp to say we want to we want
 
02:41:30.950 --> 02:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
a market consultant and they can define
 
02:41:32.550 --> 02:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
within the market consultant what all
 
02:41:35.190 --> 02:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
the conditions and scope of work is so
 
02:41:36.150 --> 02:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:36.670 align:start position:0%
go ahead
um

02:41:36.670 --> 02:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:37.990 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

02:41:37.990 --> 02:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:41:40.630 --> 02:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
where else am i here
 
02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
actually i'm pretty close to done mr
 
02:41:44.070 --> 02:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
chair i think the only thing i have left
 
02:41:45.110 --> 02:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
to change
 
02:41:47.590 --> 02:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
is on page 10 and this is based on the
 
02:41:49.750 --> 02:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
conversation we had here online number
 
02:41:52.950 --> 02:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
26 and that's the 15
 
02:41:56.389 --> 02:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
the limit on the 15 cultivation
 
02:41:59.030 --> 02:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis cultivators facilities so i'll
 
02:42:00.630 --> 02:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
strike that language if everyone's in
 
02:42:01.830 --> 02:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
agreement with that and leave it for the
 
02:42:03.510 --> 02:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
free market to be able to adapt and
 
02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:05.269 align:start position:0%
free market to be able to adapt and
adjust

02:42:05.269 --> 02:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
adjust
 
02:42:05.279 --> 02:42:06.790 align:start position:0%
adjust
26.

02:42:06.790 --> 02:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
26.
 
02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
i think that's very nice and i believe
 
02:42:15.190 --> 02:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
that is it i will say there is one
 
02:42:16.790 --> 02:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
question that was brought up and this is
 
02:42:19.110 --> 02:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
about the underlying this is a policy
 
02:42:21.190 --> 02:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
question i gotta get answered
 
02:42:22.950 --> 02:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
um there was a question on whether or
 
02:42:24.710 --> 02:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
not the language that the criminal
 
02:42:26.469 --> 02:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
justice committee did accidentally
 
02:42:30.550 --> 02:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
really re illegalized edibles
 
02:42:31.830 --> 02:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to try and get an answer
 
02:42:33.990 --> 02:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
to that question but i think they in
 
02:42:35.910 --> 02:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
trying to clean up do with the language
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
they somehow undid the other language we
 
02:42:39.830 --> 02:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
did in previous years when we
 
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
decriminalized certain things and they i
 
02:42:43.750 --> 02:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
think when they did their edit they
 
02:42:45.190 --> 02:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
might have added it back in so i'm going
 
02:42:46.630 --> 02:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
to look at that and i'll talk to the
 
02:42:48.389 --> 02:42:48.399 align:start position:0%
chairman of criminal justice to confirm
 
02:42:50.469 --> 02:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
that and take care run that down mr
 
02:42:52.790 --> 02:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
chairman if i may that was brought to us
 
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
by hhs
 
02:42:56.550 --> 02:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:42:59.269 --> 02:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
our visitor and subcommittee from hhs
 
02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
said that that this bill may
 
02:43:04.150 --> 02:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
may strike our current decrim law and
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
the last thing that we want to do is
 
02:43:08.389 --> 02:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
strike out anything that would hurt
 
02:43:11.670 --> 02:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
decrem on the edible side on the on on
 
02:43:13.269 --> 02:43:13.279 align:start position:0%
that side that may not be coming into
 
02:43:14.950 --> 02:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
our store we don't want to we don't want
 
02:43:16.550 --> 02:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
to step on that law
 
02:43:18.309 --> 02:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
right so mr j one last thing if i can
 
02:43:19.990 --> 02:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
just run through the numbers considering
 
02:43:21.190 --> 02:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
that's probably the thing we hear most
 
02:43:22.469 --> 02:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
important about based on the
 
02:43:23.670 --> 02:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
conversations we had with the
 
02:43:25.349 --> 02:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner so people can write down
 
02:43:27.110 --> 02:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
the numbers and see if they all we can
 
02:43:29.349 --> 02:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
all agree on what a fiscal outlook looks
 
02:43:31.269 --> 02:43:31.279 align:start position:0%
like for this thing
 
02:43:33.510 --> 02:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm using i'm basing everything off
 
02:43:35.429 --> 02:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
we all have this form that was given to
 
02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
us by the commission itself that has the
 
02:43:39.269 --> 02:43:39.279 align:start position:0%
revenues on it it's about the third or
 
02:43:40.790 --> 02:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
fourth paragraph down where they
 
02:43:43.190 --> 02:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
estimated that based on the tens the new
 
02:43:45.510 --> 02:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire would have about 250 million
 
02:43:48.389 --> 02:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
dollars in gross revenue for the state
 
02:43:50.950 --> 02:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
that gross revenue number would gener
 
02:43:53.030 --> 02:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
turn into approximately 50 million
 
02:43:56.630 --> 02:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
dollars in net in in gross net revenue
 
02:43:58.870 --> 02:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
to the tax to the state to spend
 
02:44:00.950 --> 02:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
um but we also know
 
02:44:04.469 --> 02:44:04.479 align:start position:0%
that of that 50 million dollars
 
02:44:06.309 --> 02:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
that included edibles in their
 
02:44:08.469 --> 02:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
projections now that's no longer in
 
02:44:10.070 --> 02:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
there so out of that 50 million dollars
 
02:44:16.309 --> 02:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:19.510 --> 02:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
revenue coming in to the state
 
02:44:21.110 --> 02:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
we also know that we're going to be
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
rolling these stores out slowly
 
02:44:25.670 --> 02:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
roughly one-third
 
02:44:27.030 --> 02:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
a year
 
02:44:29.269 --> 02:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
so for the first year full operating
 
02:44:31.030 --> 02:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
year we expect the revenue to be 10
 
02:44:32.630 --> 02:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars one third of the thirty
 
02:44:34.710 --> 02:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars so our income in the
 
02:44:36.870 --> 02:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
first year first full calendar year of
 
02:44:39.030 --> 02:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
operations with one third of the stores
 
02:44:40.389 --> 02:44:40.399 align:start position:0%
open should be around ten million
 
02:44:40.399 --> 02:44:41.750 align:start position:0%
open should be around ten million
dollars

02:44:41.750 --> 02:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:43.190 align:start position:0%
dollars
um

02:44:43.190 --> 02:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:45.269 --> 02:44:45.279 align:start position:0%
we know on the cost side
 
02:44:47.670 --> 02:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
of this that they estimated the annual
 
02:44:50.230 --> 02:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
cost for 10 stores
 
02:44:53.110 --> 02:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
was 10 stores and the personnel was 8.5
 
02:44:55.269 --> 02:44:55.279 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:44:57.510 --> 02:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
we have to divide that by one-third per
 
02:44:58.950 --> 02:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
year roughly
 
02:45:01.030 --> 02:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
um so i was trying to get them finished
 
02:45:03.429 --> 02:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
up that math so it's one third of 8.5
 
02:45:04.950 --> 02:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars so again even in the
 
02:45:07.429 --> 02:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
first year taking in 10.5 million
 
02:45:10.389 --> 02:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
dollars um their costs are only going to
 
02:45:13.030 --> 02:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
be around roughly 3 million dollars so
 
02:45:15.349 --> 02:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
we'll see revenue generation to the
 
02:45:17.510 --> 02:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
state uh on on a
 
02:45:19.510 --> 02:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
gross net level so what what they can
 
02:45:22.389 --> 02:45:22.399 align:start position:0%
actually um or distribute to towns and
 
02:45:25.110 --> 02:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
cities of around um
 
02:45:26.469 --> 02:45:26.479 align:start position:0%
three million dollars
 
02:45:28.790 --> 02:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
or so um
 
02:45:30.230 --> 02:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
for the startup that's after with just
 
02:45:31.830 --> 02:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
three stores open and then those numbers
 
02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
are i'm sorry i apologize the number is
 
02:45:36.389 --> 02:45:36.399 align:start position:0%
10.5 million dollars in the first year
 
02:45:39.110 --> 02:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
and that number will grow as the stores
 
02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:40.710 align:start position:0%
and that number will grow as the stores
grow

02:45:40.710 --> 02:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
grow
 
02:45:41.910 --> 02:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
so i just want to give you some basic
 
02:45:43.429 --> 02:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
numbers where we're at even in the first
 
02:45:44.870 --> 02:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
year they should be profitable with 30
 
02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
stores and give them enough money to
 
02:45:48.950 --> 02:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
start rolling it back into the agency to
 
02:45:51.429 --> 02:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
be able to open the other stores
 
02:45:53.590 --> 02:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
would you put that into a i will put it
 
02:45:54.710 --> 02:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
into an email and distribute to the
 
02:46:00.150 --> 02:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
there is one other thing on revenues
 
02:46:03.680 --> 02:46:06.230 align:start position:0%
there is one other thing on revenues
yeah

02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:08.230 --> 02:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
one other thing on revenue is that
 
02:46:11.830 --> 02:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
darrell abbas emailed me yesterday and
 
02:46:14.550 --> 02:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
he sent a copy to fred de set and tim
 
02:46:17.030 --> 02:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
lang i probably you haven't
 
02:46:18.630 --> 02:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
i got it this morning but i'll take a
 
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
look at it and see how his numbers
 
02:46:21.030 --> 02:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
compared to everything else we talked
 
02:46:24.070 --> 02:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
about forward that to all the members
 
02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:24.950 align:start position:0%
about forward that to all the members
and

02:46:24.950 --> 02:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:26.950 --> 02:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
it was an analysis done for
 
02:46:30.150 --> 02:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
massachusetts in order to come up with
 
02:46:32.469 --> 02:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
numbers for new hampshire
 
02:46:34.309 --> 02:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
and i want you to take a look at that
 
02:46:36.389 --> 02:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
i'll get that out to you today
 
02:46:38.469 --> 02:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
but they come out 40 to 50 million
 
02:46:38.479 --> 02:46:42.070 align:start position:0%
but they come out 40 to 50 million
dollars

02:46:42.070 --> 02:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:43.830 --> 02:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair could i just say one last thing
 
02:46:46.630 --> 02:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so this isn't necessarily
 
02:46:48.389 --> 02:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
a ways and means thing but again i i
 
02:46:50.870 --> 02:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
look at this in this conversation about
 
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
we have the the what and the how
 
02:46:55.670 --> 02:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
and for me the what is the most
 
02:46:57.750 --> 02:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
important conversation we're having and
 
02:46:59.429 --> 02:46:59.439 align:start position:0%
the how just gets us there right and
 
02:47:01.269 --> 02:47:01.279 align:start position:0%
when i say that what i mean is
 
02:47:02.870 --> 02:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
legalization to me is the most important
 
02:47:04.469 --> 02:47:04.479 align:start position:0%
thing and i am holding my nose when i
 
02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
vote for this thing i i'm not
 
02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily like the way it's done
 
02:47:09.510 --> 02:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
at all
 
02:47:11.750 --> 02:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
but my ultimate goal is to stop
 
02:47:13.349 --> 02:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
arresting our citizens
 
02:47:15.190 --> 02:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
stop crim get making criminals out of
 
02:47:16.469 --> 02:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
our citizens
 
02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
for this product which i don't think is
 
02:47:19.670 --> 02:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
any more dangerous than beer or wine and
 
02:47:21.190 --> 02:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
actually i'd argue it's probably less
 
02:47:23.510 --> 02:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
dangerous than beard wine
 
02:47:24.870 --> 02:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
considering the number of domestics i've
 
02:47:26.469 --> 02:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
been as a police officer for beer and
 
02:47:28.070 --> 02:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
wine compared to marijuana which was
 
02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:29.110 align:start position:0%
wine compared to marijuana which was
zero

02:47:29.110 --> 02:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
zero
 
02:47:31.910 --> 02:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and so i don't want everybody to get
 
02:47:34.710 --> 02:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
caught up right in in arguing over the
 
02:47:37.349 --> 02:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
how right we got to get if we if our
 
02:47:39.030 --> 02:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
goal if we our
 
02:47:40.710 --> 02:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
goal is to achieve
 
02:47:42.630 --> 02:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
legalization and to stop arresting our
 
02:47:44.710 --> 02:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
citizens stop incarcerating our citizens
 
02:47:45.990 --> 02:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
stop making criminals out of our
 
02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:47.349 align:start position:0%
stop making criminals out of our
citizens

02:47:47.349 --> 02:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
02:47:49.349 --> 02:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
it's going to involve compromise
 
02:47:51.030 --> 02:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to hold our nose and
 
02:47:52.389 --> 02:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
vote for something i'm going to hold my
 
02:47:53.750 --> 02:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
nose and vote for this when we get to a
 
02:47:55.910 --> 02:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
final things even if we decide to change
 
02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
the financial makeup from what i
 
02:47:59.190 --> 02:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
suggested i'll hold my nose and i'll
 
02:48:01.510 --> 02:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
vote for it because
 
02:48:03.830 --> 02:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
again it's the what that's the most
 
02:48:05.349 --> 02:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
important thing stop arresting our
 
02:48:07.030 --> 02:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
citizens stop making criminals out of
 
02:48:08.550 --> 02:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
our citizens
 
02:48:11.429 --> 02:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
and let's move forward
 
02:48:14.550 --> 02:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
right and myself personally i would have
 
02:48:17.910 --> 02:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:17.920 --> 02:48:21.349 align:start position:0%
 
because

02:48:21.349 --> 02:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:23.349 --> 02:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
by doing this
 
02:48:25.590 --> 02:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
you're telling our youth this is
 
02:48:28.070 --> 02:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
perfectly acceptable
 
02:48:29.990 --> 02:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't think anybody here that's a
 
02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:31.269 align:start position:0%
and i don't think anybody here that's a
parent

02:48:31.269 --> 02:48:31.279 align:start position:0%
parent
 
02:48:33.830 --> 02:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
would want to encourage their kids to
 
02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
use marijuana or these edibles
 
02:48:39.510 --> 02:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
but our job here is
 
02:48:42.550 --> 02:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
because the policy was set
 
02:48:45.750 --> 02:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
we need to look at this bill
 
02:48:48.389 --> 02:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
from a financial aspect
 
02:48:50.790 --> 02:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
make it as good as we can for the state
 
02:48:53.110 --> 02:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire and
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
not exceed
 
02:48:56.630 --> 02:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
what's not in there
 
02:48:56.640 --> 02:48:58.469 align:start position:0%
what's not in there
and

02:48:58.469 --> 02:48:58.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:49:01.990 --> 02:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
then bring it to the floor
 
02:49:03.750 --> 02:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
i probably
 
02:49:07.590 --> 02:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
well anyway i'll make my mind up then
 
02:49:10.870 --> 02:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
but but we need to do our job
 
02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
make it as best as we can
 
02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:14.710 align:start position:0%
make it as best as we can
with

02:49:14.710 --> 02:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:49:19.110 --> 02:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:21.030 --> 02:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
you had something to say
 
02:49:22.710 --> 02:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
well i mean we are the how committee
 
02:49:23.910 --> 02:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
even though
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
tim you're right
 
02:49:26.950 --> 02:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
that the criminal justice was the other
 
02:49:29.510 --> 02:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
committee that said this is the policy
 
02:49:30.870 --> 02:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sure decriminalization
 
02:49:30.880 --> 02:49:32.790 align:start position:0%
i'm sure decriminalization
decriminalization

02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
decriminalization
 
02:49:35.990 --> 02:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
of it was part of their reasoning but
 
02:49:38.070 --> 02:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
that's what we do how and we are fixing
 
02:49:39.190 --> 02:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:49:42.230 --> 02:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:49:43.670 --> 02:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
i do have one other comment about the
 
02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:45.110 align:start position:0%
i do have one other comment about the
edibles

02:49:45.110 --> 02:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
edibles
 
02:49:46.389 --> 02:49:46.399 align:start position:0%
is that one other thing we have to
 
02:49:48.309 --> 02:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
address i think i think the chair made
 
02:49:49.910 --> 02:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
it clear that we're not going to put
 
02:49:51.830 --> 02:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
edibles back in
 
02:49:53.269 --> 02:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
but the one thing about edibles we have
 
02:49:55.830 --> 02:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
to discuss i still think is
 
02:49:59.510 --> 02:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
whether they should be sold to
 
02:50:02.469 --> 02:50:02.479 align:start position:0%
why do we have it in there that atc
 
02:50:02.479 --> 02:50:03.670 align:start position:0%
why do we have it in there that atc
atc

02:50:03.670 --> 02:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
atc
 
02:50:05.429 --> 02:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
patients with a card can go in and
 
02:50:07.990 --> 02:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
expect to see edibles that's that's a
 
02:50:09.910 --> 02:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
ridiculous situation you should ask the
 
02:50:11.269 --> 02:50:11.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner i talked to him offline
 
02:50:12.550 --> 02:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
about this
 
02:50:15.030 --> 02:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
so how does that work how do we how do
 
02:50:16.150 --> 02:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:50:18.070 --> 02:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh edibles on the shelves but most of
 
02:50:19.670 --> 02:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
their customers coming in so you can't
 
02:50:21.110 --> 02:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
can't have those
 
02:50:23.110 --> 02:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
so i think we should take the atc
 
02:50:25.190 --> 02:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
portion out of it
 
02:50:26.870 --> 02:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
02:50:28.309 --> 02:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
as an alternative because it's going to
 
02:50:31.349 --> 02:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
hurt the atc's too
 
02:50:33.670 --> 02:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
is it did i say that clearly
 
02:50:35.190 --> 02:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
yes i completely understand what you're
 
02:50:37.269 --> 02:50:37.279 align:start position:0%
saying and i completely you know we have
 
02:50:38.630 --> 02:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
this conversation in subcommittee we
 
02:50:40.309 --> 02:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
have basically three options we remove
 
02:50:41.750 --> 02:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
the medical edibles and they're not
 
02:50:44.710 --> 02:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
there we leave them in there or we just
 
02:50:46.790 --> 02:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
barge ahead and leave recreational and
 
02:50:48.870 --> 02:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
put recreational edibles in i will tell
 
02:50:50.790 --> 02:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
you the last one's a show stopper for
 
02:50:53.670 --> 02:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
some for some people in this process um
 
02:50:55.349 --> 02:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
as it moves through the legislative
 
02:50:59.269 --> 02:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
process so um what's the showstopper
 
02:51:01.510 --> 02:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
having recreational edibles in the state
 
02:51:04.550 --> 02:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
store as a showstopper for for uh
 
02:51:05.990 --> 02:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the other two pieces of
 
02:51:12.070 --> 02:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:14.309 --> 02:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
um so again you know
 
02:51:16.790 --> 02:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
whether we include recreational or
 
02:51:19.030 --> 02:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
medicinal is the question right and and
 
02:51:20.710 --> 02:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
i can have when i finish getting the
 
02:51:22.469 --> 02:51:22.479 align:start position:0%
final draft i can have them draft two
 
02:51:24.550 --> 02:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
versions one striking medical and one
 
02:51:25.910 --> 02:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
leaving medical in and we can choose
 
02:51:27.190 --> 02:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
between those two
 
02:51:29.269 --> 02:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh versions or if we could
 
02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
just have a
 
02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
strong vote right now
 
02:51:34.309 --> 02:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
do you wanna have discussion on that
 
02:51:37.670 --> 02:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
yeah it's time to vote oh what's that
 
02:51:41.750 --> 02:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:43.830 --> 02:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
just have a straw vote right now to see
 
02:51:46.630 --> 02:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
if we're mostly on the same page
 
02:51:48.150 --> 02:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
about that
 
02:51:49.830 --> 02:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
so i i just have one if we're going to
 
02:51:51.269 --> 02:51:51.279 align:start position:0%
do that i just have a statement i would
 
02:51:53.349 --> 02:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
have waited till monday but
 
02:51:55.030 --> 02:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to wait some months okay
 
02:51:56.469 --> 02:51:56.479 align:start position:0%
okay can i
 
02:51:58.710 --> 02:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
ask two
 
02:52:01.429 --> 02:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
revenue questions about
 
02:52:03.510 --> 02:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
edibles one is
 
02:52:06.389 --> 02:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
when you went into subcommittee
 
02:52:06.399 --> 02:52:07.269 align:start position:0%
when you went into subcommittee
we

02:52:07.269 --> 02:52:07.279 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:52:09.110 --> 02:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
had 50
 
02:52:09.120 --> 02:52:11.349 align:start position:0%
had 50
edibles

02:52:11.349 --> 02:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
edibles
 
02:52:13.670 --> 02:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
and for the revenues
 
02:52:15.750 --> 02:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
now it's 40
 
02:52:15.760 --> 02:52:16.790 align:start position:0%
now it's 40
and

02:52:16.790 --> 02:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:52:19.830 --> 02:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
we did have those maine people uh
 
02:52:22.309 --> 02:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
who are here who
 
02:52:24.630 --> 02:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
explained something that i thought was
 
02:52:27.510 --> 02:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
perfectly reasonable that they take the
 
02:52:30.309 --> 02:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
lower quality marijuana that
 
02:52:30.319 --> 02:52:31.190 align:start position:0%
lower quality marijuana that
that

02:52:31.190 --> 02:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:52:33.990 --> 02:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
they grow that doesn't work quite and
 
02:52:37.190 --> 02:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
those go into the edibles
 
02:52:39.910 --> 02:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
which would increase the
 
02:52:43.510 --> 02:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
decrease about the
 
02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
which would make it more
 
02:52:47.910 --> 02:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
than the 40 percent i don't know where
 
02:52:51.910 --> 02:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
the 40 came from i'd just like to know
 
02:52:52.870 --> 02:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
so that originally started from
 
02:52:57.910 --> 02:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative abrami gave us uh in in
 
02:52:59.269 --> 02:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
the committee from the original bill
 
02:53:01.190 --> 02:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
were having a conversation he had gone
 
02:53:03.190 --> 02:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
online and did some research and i i
 
02:53:05.590 --> 02:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
think actually we're we're goofing now
 
02:53:07.269 --> 02:53:07.279 align:start position:0%
that i'm thinking about it because as
 
02:53:08.790 --> 02:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
the commissioner said
 
02:53:11.910 --> 02:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
vaping isn't considered an edible
 
02:53:14.790 --> 02:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
right so that was 26 percent i took out
 
02:53:18.070 --> 02:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
to get to the 40 40 so
 
02:53:20.630 --> 02:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
it's 18 edibles and ingestibles are 18
 
02:53:21.830 --> 02:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
or 20
 
02:53:24.309 --> 02:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
vaping and ointments are not edibles
 
02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
right exactly so you'd allow pre-rolls
 
02:53:29.110 --> 02:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
accessories topicals flour cartridges
 
02:53:30.870 --> 02:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
and concentrates the only thing you
 
02:53:32.710 --> 02:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't allow was basically gummies and
 
02:53:34.070 --> 02:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
cookies and brownies
 
02:53:34.080 --> 02:53:35.110 align:start position:0%
cookies and brownies
so

02:53:35.110 --> 02:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:53:38.630 --> 02:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
you better do is double check with the
 
02:53:42.070 --> 02:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
the the hidden person there
 
02:53:44.389 --> 02:53:44.399 align:start position:0%
because exactly we we're we've kind of
 
02:53:47.110 --> 02:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
grouped in edibles and ingestibles
 
02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
with some of these other pre-rolls which
 
02:53:50.550 --> 02:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
are a big thing now
 
02:53:51.910 --> 02:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
people don't want to roll their own like
 
02:53:53.830 --> 02:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
they buy them already and they're all
 
02:53:55.750 --> 02:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
consistently done
 
02:53:57.910 --> 02:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh accessories it's not a big topicals
 
02:54:00.070 --> 02:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
which is very minor the the just like
 
02:54:01.269 --> 02:54:01.279 align:start position:0%
that you put on your arm you know
 
02:54:04.309 --> 02:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
absorbs it as scandal it's more medical
 
02:54:07.349 --> 02:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
right flour is your traditional that's
 
02:54:09.269 --> 02:54:09.279 align:start position:0%
the loose marijuana that you roll your
 
02:54:11.510 --> 02:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
own and then cartridges is a big thing
 
02:54:13.750 --> 02:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
which is you know it's it's the vaping
 
02:54:16.389 --> 02:54:16.399 align:start position:0%
devices that that have marijuana you
 
02:54:16.399 --> 02:54:17.590 align:start position:0%
devices that that have marijuana you
know

02:54:17.590 --> 02:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:54:19.349 --> 02:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
thc in them
 
02:54:21.990 --> 02:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
and then the concentrates are 14 percent
 
02:54:23.830 --> 02:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
that that's according to this
 
02:54:27.030 --> 02:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
study uh this report that i found
 
02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:27.990 align:start position:0%
study uh this report that i found
so

02:54:27.990 --> 02:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:54:29.590 --> 02:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
so what do we
 
02:54:31.670 --> 02:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
i think the bill needs to well we should
 
02:54:34.469 --> 02:54:34.479 align:start position:0%
define the stuff in the bill in a way
 
02:54:36.309 --> 02:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
as to what we're talking about
 
02:54:37.910 --> 02:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
because concentrates and i'm sure the
 
02:54:39.670 --> 02:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
cartridge manufacturers make car
 
02:54:42.630 --> 02:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
cartridges concentrates or they extract
 
02:54:44.309 --> 02:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
the stuff out of the out of the flour
 
02:54:46.230 --> 02:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
and they create and probably the stem
 
02:54:46.240 --> 02:54:48.230 align:start position:0%
and they create and probably the stem
too

02:54:48.230 --> 02:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:54:50.389 --> 02:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
i think when i re-read the bill
 
02:54:51.990 --> 02:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's what i realized actually the
 
02:54:53.510 --> 02:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
vaping cartridges were allowed even
 
02:54:55.110 --> 02:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
though we took them out in our financial
 
02:54:56.630 --> 02:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
calculations thinking how much it was
 
02:54:57.590 --> 02:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
02:54:57.600 --> 02:54:58.389 align:start position:0%
going to be
but

02:54:58.389 --> 02:54:58.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:55:00.150 --> 02:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
in the bill itself it doesn't actually
 
02:55:03.510 --> 02:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
prohibit it and so it just
 
02:55:06.469 --> 02:55:06.479 align:start position:0%
it prohibits edibles which i mean that
 
02:55:08.550 --> 02:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
you know what you take orally but then
 
02:55:09.990 --> 02:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
if you can still convoluted but then we
 
02:55:11.429 --> 02:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
need manufacturers who are going to come
 
02:55:14.550 --> 02:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
in and manufacture certain things
 
02:55:15.670 --> 02:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
so we're going to say well we're going
 
02:55:17.590 --> 02:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
to try to attract manufacturers to
 
02:55:19.910 --> 02:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
manufacture the cartridges for us
 
02:55:21.910 --> 02:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean let's say
 
02:55:24.469 --> 02:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
i i don't quite know how that works but
 
02:55:26.469 --> 02:55:26.479 align:start position:0%
you know use it you'll manufacture
 
02:55:29.110 --> 02:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
everything the way i look at it it'd be
 
02:55:31.110 --> 02:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
like any other supply chain right if i
 
02:55:32.710 --> 02:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
go to a store i may not buy everything
 
02:55:34.950 --> 02:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
the store sells but i'm gonna take what
 
02:55:36.150 --> 02:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
i want so if a man we have a
 
02:55:37.830 --> 02:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's license
 
02:55:39.190 --> 02:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
or in this case we're gonna allow the
 
02:55:42.309 --> 02:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
atcs to sell so they may
 
02:55:44.230 --> 02:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
ramp up their vaping side of their
 
02:55:46.950 --> 02:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
cartridges and not touch their gummy
 
02:55:49.830 --> 02:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
bears right they're gummies because
 
02:55:51.030 --> 02:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
um they don't they know they don't have
 
02:55:53.030 --> 02:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
a state outlet for that so but they do
 
02:55:54.870 --> 02:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
have a state outlet for cartridges so
 
02:55:58.790 --> 02:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to ramp up excuse me okay
 
02:56:00.389 --> 02:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
bernstein wants to say something
 
02:56:02.230 --> 02:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
followed by representative spillsberg
 
02:56:05.190 --> 02:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair i mean we are um
 
02:56:06.710 --> 02:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to consider over the
 
02:56:08.630 --> 02:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
weekend and there's been some people
 
02:56:10.309 --> 02:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
sitting in the room all morning with
 
02:56:13.030 --> 02:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
some a lot of expertise and i would love
 
02:56:15.110 --> 02:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
to let them briefly
 
02:56:16.950 --> 02:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps give us more to think about over
 
02:56:19.429 --> 02:56:19.439 align:start position:0%
the weekend and hear some comments
 
02:56:22.070 --> 02:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
if if you if with the indulgence of the
 
02:56:22.080 --> 02:56:23.830 align:start position:0%
if if you if with the indulgence of the
chair

02:56:23.830 --> 02:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:56:26.389 --> 02:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
does anybody there have comments that
 
02:56:36.710 --> 02:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:36.720 --> 02:56:39.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:56:39.269 --> 02:56:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:40.950 --> 02:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
can i answer one question
 
02:56:49.910 --> 02:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:52.830 --> 02:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
i think the banking's going to disappear
 
02:56:55.110 --> 02:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
yeah they they but they came up with the
 
02:56:57.110 --> 02:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
language that's in the bill for the
 
02:56:59.110 --> 02:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
raise done okay
 
02:57:01.830 --> 02:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
that looks pretty standard to me
 
02:57:04.389 --> 02:57:04.399 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury
 
02:57:06.389 --> 02:57:06.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman yeah before we get
 
02:57:07.750 --> 02:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
into the
 
02:57:10.550 --> 02:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
delve down other paths i just
 
02:57:12.230 --> 02:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether this is really
 
02:57:13.510 --> 02:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
important to say or not but
 
02:57:15.190 --> 02:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
philosophically one thing i think we
 
02:57:17.349 --> 02:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
should all be baking into our thinking
 
02:57:19.030 --> 02:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
over the weekend
 
02:57:20.150 --> 02:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:57:22.710 --> 02:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
i think as legislators we're accustomed
 
02:57:24.469 --> 02:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
to work in a domain
 
02:57:28.070 --> 02:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
of regulation and fees and taxes and to
 
02:57:29.190 --> 02:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
try to
 
02:57:31.510 --> 02:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
create a structure with uncertainty with
 
02:57:32.950 --> 02:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of certainty
 
02:57:35.269 --> 02:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
or as much as we can anticipate
 
02:57:37.269 --> 02:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
but we're dealing with a situation here
 
02:57:39.590 --> 02:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
also where we're we're creating an
 
02:57:42.389 --> 02:57:42.399 align:start position:0%
enterprise and an enterprise requires a
 
02:57:44.790 --> 02:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
lot of flexibility and freedom
 
02:57:46.710 --> 02:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh trial and error
 
02:57:48.830 --> 02:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
learning through the process
 
02:57:51.269 --> 02:57:51.279 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial spirits and so on so the
 
02:57:53.830 --> 02:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
bill has to be
 
02:57:55.750 --> 02:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
find the balance
 
02:57:58.150 --> 02:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
between creating a regulatory regime
 
02:58:00.070 --> 02:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't go off the rails
 
02:58:02.230 --> 02:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
but also allowing enough flexibility in
 
02:58:05.030 --> 02:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
the operating uh environment
 
02:58:08.230 --> 02:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
to actually compete to price
 
02:58:11.030 --> 02:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
to work out relationships uh and i i
 
02:58:14.309 --> 02:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
think uh the takeaways for example from
 
02:58:17.110 --> 02:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
the fellows from maine who testified
 
02:58:19.990 --> 02:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
is in in the practical reality of
 
02:58:22.790 --> 02:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
running an enterprise
 
02:58:24.550 --> 02:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of decisions that may be
 
02:58:26.150 --> 02:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
made on the fly
 
02:58:28.710 --> 02:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
may be made to adjust from experience
 
02:58:31.110 --> 02:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
and so let's not tighten it down so hard
 
02:58:36.150 --> 02:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:36.160 --> 02:58:38.230 align:start position:0%
 
soccer

02:58:38.230 --> 02:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
soccer
 
02:58:40.870 --> 02:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
this is a really boring question but
 
02:58:43.510 --> 02:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
the coast county delegation is going to
 
02:58:47.590 --> 02:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
vote on its annual budget on monday
 
02:58:50.309 --> 02:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
so could you tell me what your plan is
 
02:58:52.710 --> 02:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
for next week you're not going to exact
 
02:58:57.190 --> 02:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:58.830 --> 02:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
what i was
 
02:59:02.469 --> 02:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:04.230 --> 02:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
that may not happen
 
02:59:06.389 --> 02:59:06.399 align:start position:0%
i was hoping that we could
 
02:59:09.429 --> 02:59:09.439 align:start position:0%
exact on monday i mean i'm happy to give
 
02:59:11.349 --> 02:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
up going to the annual budget but i need
 
02:59:13.349 --> 02:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to tell the chairman after
 
02:59:14.950 --> 02:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
this discussion
 
02:59:17.510 --> 02:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to spend a long time
 
02:59:17.520 --> 02:59:18.550 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to spend a long time
monday

02:59:18.550 --> 02:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
monday
 
02:59:20.790 --> 02:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
ironing these things out
 
02:59:22.469 --> 02:59:22.479 align:start position:0%
but monday we're going to take care of
 
02:59:24.269 --> 02:59:24.279 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
02:59:28.309 --> 02:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
1584 first it shouldn't take long and
 
02:59:30.309 --> 02:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
after we take care of that and we'll
 
02:59:32.550 --> 02:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
spend the rest of the time
 
02:59:34.389 --> 02:59:34.399 align:start position:0%
on monday
 
02:59:37.110 --> 02:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
and if we're not satisfied
 
02:59:37.120 --> 02:59:38.230 align:start position:0%
and if we're not satisfied
then

02:59:38.230 --> 02:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:59:41.830 --> 02:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
on wednesday we will
 
02:59:43.910 --> 02:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
but if you are satisfied you would you
 
02:59:46.309 --> 02:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
exact on monday yes
 
02:59:49.510 --> 02:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
okay so i'll be here again
 
02:59:50.790 --> 02:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
02:59:52.630 --> 02:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
i don't want to miss the executing of
 
02:59:53.990 --> 02:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:59:55.910 --> 02:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay so that's my time and i can't
 
02:59:57.590 --> 02:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
promise that that's going to happen i
 
02:59:57.600 --> 02:59:58.790 align:start position:0%
promise that that's going to happen i
understand

02:59:58.790 --> 02:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:59:58.800 --> 03:00:00.870 align:start position:0%
understand
yeah

03:00:00.870 --> 03:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:00:02.950 --> 03:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
anybody else perhaps online i just want
 
03:00:04.469 --> 03:00:04.479 align:start position:0%
to say anybody who has have to read the
 
03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
amendment over the weekend has
 
03:00:07.990 --> 03:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
suggestions or changes especially if
 
03:00:09.429 --> 03:00:09.439 align:start position:0%
they're just simple changes if you can
 
03:00:10.950 --> 03:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
get them to me so that up monday i can
 
03:00:14.070 --> 03:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
actually have a a draft you know of the
 
03:00:17.110 --> 03:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
minor changes that we we all see or feel
 
03:00:18.950 --> 03:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
um and then it'll give us a better
 
03:00:20.630 --> 03:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
starting point rather than trying to
 
03:00:22.630 --> 03:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
merge them all together in the middle of
 
03:00:22.640 --> 03:00:23.349 align:start position:0%
merge them all together in the middle of
a

03:00:23.349 --> 03:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:00:23.359 --> 03:00:26.230 align:start position:0%
a
20

03:00:26.230 --> 03:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:28.309 --> 03:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry say that again
 
03:00:30.230 --> 03:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
you'll have fresh copies of this i will
 
03:00:31.590 --> 03:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
have fresh copies i already know we've
 
03:00:33.670 --> 03:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
made two or three changes just in our
 
03:00:35.590 --> 03:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
conversations today from what i had put
 
03:00:38.790 --> 03:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
in so if you have more uh that are the
 
03:00:40.070 --> 03:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
cleanup language or that kind of thing
 
03:00:42.150 --> 03:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
just please email me and i'll try to get
 
03:00:43.990 --> 03:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
them into ols so that on monday when we
 
03:00:45.910 --> 03:00:45.920 align:start position:0%

will get their
 
03:00:59.510 --> 03:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
amendments squared away
 
03:01:03.190 --> 03:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:06.070 --> 03:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative elmi thank you i mean we
 
03:01:07.910 --> 03:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
did this a little while ago and i was
 
03:01:09.030 --> 03:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
03:01:09.040 --> 03:01:09.910 align:start position:0%
trying to
on

03:01:09.910 --> 03:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:01:09.920 --> 03:01:11.429 align:start position:0%
on
representative

03:01:11.429 --> 03:01:11.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:01:15.349 --> 03:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh clerk who is head of the atc
 
03:01:17.349 --> 03:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
03:01:19.349 --> 03:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
has told me that they are totally
 
03:01:21.910 --> 03:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to vaping
 
03:01:23.910 --> 03:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
so don't
 
03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:24.710 align:start position:0%
so don't
and

03:01:24.710 --> 03:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:01:26.389 --> 03:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
confirm that if you want i don't know if
 
03:01:28.389 --> 03:01:28.399 align:start position:0%
anybody's here
 
03:01:28.399 --> 03:01:29.750 align:start position:0%
anybody's here
but

03:01:29.750 --> 03:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:01:29.760 --> 03:01:31.349 align:start position:0%
but
otherwise

03:01:31.349 --> 03:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
03:01:36.870 --> 03:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:40.150 --> 03:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
i hope we're going to get all of this
 
03:01:42.550 --> 03:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
emailed to us so that we can print it
 
03:01:45.030 --> 03:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
out and figure out
 
03:01:47.030 --> 03:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
what for instance what the numbers are
 
03:01:49.110 --> 03:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
because it looked to me like part of it
 
03:01:52.070 --> 03:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:55.110 --> 03:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
and i just probably wasn't following it
 
03:01:56.950 --> 03:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative romney i think i think mr
 
03:01:58.309 --> 03:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
simon can
 
03:02:00.950 --> 03:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
i think mr simon can help us with one or
 
03:02:02.550 --> 03:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
two things while he's here i think we
 
03:02:09.110 --> 03:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:10.710 --> 03:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
you want to represe do you want to start
 
03:02:12.870 --> 03:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
with representative romney's question
 
03:02:14.230 --> 03:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
03:02:15.750 --> 03:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
just to clarify the medical oversight
 
03:02:17.110 --> 03:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
board i've attended all of their
 
03:02:19.110 --> 03:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
meetings they did adopt a formal
 
03:02:21.670 --> 03:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
position which if i may
 
03:02:23.590 --> 03:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
try to replicate it off the top my head
 
03:02:26.710 --> 03:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
was any adult use any legalization bill
 
03:02:28.870 --> 03:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
to do adult use cannabis
 
03:02:30.870 --> 03:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
should be evaluated on on the basis of
 
03:02:32.870 --> 03:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
its impacts on the therapeutic cannabis
 
03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:34.309 align:start position:0%
its impacts on the therapeutic cannabis
program

03:02:34.309 --> 03:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:02:35.990 --> 03:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
that program is important and needs to
 
03:02:38.070 --> 03:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
be maintained that's the only formal
 
03:02:40.550 --> 03:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
position the medical oversight board has
 
03:02:42.950 --> 03:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
taken i know that some of the
 
03:02:45.110 --> 03:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
medical professionals on that board have
 
03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
personally strong feelings about vaping
 
03:02:49.429 --> 03:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
but that has not been discussed at any
 
03:02:50.870 --> 03:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
of the public meetings and they have not
 
03:02:52.469 --> 03:02:52.479 align:start position:0%
taken a position that i'm aware of on
 
03:02:52.479 --> 03:02:53.190 align:start position:0%
taken a position that i'm aware of on
that

03:02:53.190 --> 03:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:02:55.990 --> 03:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay but i do not think you should be
 
03:02:58.710 --> 03:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
trying to say that they should start
 
03:03:01.110 --> 03:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
selling vaping products without talking
 
03:03:04.950 --> 03:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:07.030 --> 03:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
and you have
 
03:03:08.550 --> 03:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
answers to any other
 
03:03:10.150 --> 03:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
i was going to comment on a couple other
 
03:03:12.070 --> 03:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
things thank you for the record matt
 
03:03:14.389 --> 03:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
simon representing prime atc
 
03:03:15.750 --> 03:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
and i thank you again for your time on
 
03:03:17.830 --> 03:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
monday i'm encouraged by a lot of the
 
03:03:20.469 --> 03:03:20.479 align:start position:0%
things i'm hearing overall
 
03:03:21.750 --> 03:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
i was encouraged by the liquor
 
03:03:23.910 --> 03:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner's testimony saying that we
 
03:03:25.750 --> 03:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
need more cultivation licenses because
 
03:03:27.830 --> 03:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
as i said on monday this is not going to
 
03:03:30.309 --> 03:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
be a successful market if you only have
 
03:03:33.910 --> 03:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
a very small number of cultivators and
 
03:03:36.230 --> 03:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
so that's that's all very encouraging
 
03:03:38.469 --> 03:03:38.479 align:start position:0%
i would reiterate that our position on
 
03:03:41.510 --> 03:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
the bill is opposed as currently written
 
03:03:43.030 --> 03:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
and we will have to evaluate this
 
03:03:44.790 --> 03:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
amendment and have attorneys look at it
 
03:03:46.710 --> 03:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
before we can get back to you with a
 
03:03:48.389 --> 03:03:48.399 align:start position:0%
position on it
 
03:03:50.070 --> 03:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
what's the opposite
 
03:03:52.710 --> 03:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
why are you opposing it well we are
 
03:03:54.550 --> 03:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
supportive of legalization and we've
 
03:03:57.190 --> 03:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
supported other legalization bills uh
 
03:03:59.429 --> 03:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
certainly note hb 629's already passed
 
03:04:01.590 --> 03:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
the house so when we talk about
 
03:04:03.510 --> 03:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
stopping arrests the house has already
 
03:04:04.790 --> 03:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
passed a bill
 
03:04:06.870 --> 03:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
that does that so i think this is
 
03:04:09.429 --> 03:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
something entirely different and we
 
03:04:11.429 --> 03:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
believe that to create a market for
 
03:04:13.110 --> 03:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis is something that should be
 
03:04:15.590 --> 03:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
done thoughtfully and deliberately and
 
03:04:16.950 --> 03:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
with a
 
03:04:18.710 --> 03:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
great knowledge base and i think the
 
03:04:20.870 --> 03:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
bills that were based on the study
 
03:04:23.110 --> 03:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
commission's recommendations uh
 
03:04:24.870 --> 03:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
really created a much more thoughtful
 
03:04:24.880 --> 03:04:25.910 align:start position:0%
really created a much more thoughtful
policy

03:04:25.910 --> 03:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
policy
 
03:04:27.830 --> 03:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
than this bill i think as it passed the
 
03:04:29.830 --> 03:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
original committee in the house
 
03:04:31.910 --> 03:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
originally it was an unworkable bill i
 
03:04:33.910 --> 03:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
think that became clear to many of you
 
03:04:35.510 --> 03:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
at the public hearing and you're now
 
03:04:37.830 --> 03:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
trying to make it workable so we support
 
03:04:39.830 --> 03:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
that process we want to help you make it
 
03:04:42.150 --> 03:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
workable in case it does pass so that it
 
03:04:44.630 --> 03:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
is is a as good a policy as we can make
 
03:04:47.349 --> 03:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
it but currently it's very far from from
 
03:04:49.429 --> 03:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
what we believe would be ideal
 
03:04:52.070 --> 03:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
legalization policy so
 
03:04:54.550 --> 03:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
did you follow along with the amendment
 
03:04:57.269 --> 03:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
as proposed by i did so the biggest
 
03:04:59.269 --> 03:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
thing that i see uh
 
03:04:59.279 --> 03:05:00.230 align:start position:0%
thing that i see uh
is

03:05:00.230 --> 03:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:05:00.240 --> 03:05:01.110 align:start position:0%
is
that

03:05:01.110 --> 03:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:05:03.750 --> 03:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
while it does clarify that the htc's
 
03:05:03.760 --> 03:05:04.710 align:start position:0%
while it does clarify that the htc's
could

03:05:04.710 --> 03:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:05:08.150 --> 03:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
apply for adult use licenses it does not
 
03:05:11.190 --> 03:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
authorize us to convert to for-profit
 
03:05:13.269 --> 03:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
businesses so essentially what you would
 
03:05:15.269 --> 03:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
be doing if this passed as i understand
 
03:05:15.279 --> 03:05:16.309 align:start position:0%
be doing if this passed as i understand
it

03:05:16.309 --> 03:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:05:19.349 --> 03:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
would be inviting uh
 
03:05:21.349 --> 03:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
if well it would have been 15
 
03:05:23.349 --> 03:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
cultivators under the bill if it's not
 
03:05:25.190 --> 03:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
amended if it's amended to unlimited
 
03:05:25.200 --> 03:05:26.710 align:start position:0%
amended if it's amended to unlimited
licenses

03:05:26.710 --> 03:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
03:05:27.990 --> 03:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
either way you're going to be saying
 
03:05:29.590 --> 03:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
for-profit companies are welcome to
 
03:05:32.790 --> 03:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
establish in new hampshire and atc's yes
 
03:05:34.550 --> 03:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
you can compete for with them that you
 
03:05:35.990 --> 03:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
have to remain a non-profit and
 
03:05:37.510 --> 03:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
therefore you won't be able to access
 
03:05:39.269 --> 03:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
capital and you will be operating at a
 
03:05:41.510 --> 03:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
massive disadvantage so we think that's
 
03:05:44.230 --> 03:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
fundamentally unfair uh if the atcs
 
03:05:46.309 --> 03:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
aren't able to compete on a level
 
03:05:47.670 --> 03:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
playing field against these new
 
03:05:47.680 --> 03:05:48.790 align:start position:0%
playing field against these new
businesses

03:05:48.790 --> 03:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
03:05:50.790 --> 03:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh i don't understand how we could
 
03:05:53.590 --> 03:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
support that it's just not fair
 
03:05:55.750 --> 03:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair just to respond to that that
 
03:05:58.070 --> 03:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
was not the intent the intent was we'd
 
03:06:00.710 --> 03:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
have a parallel for-profit license
 
03:06:03.990 --> 03:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
and apply so um and be able to use the
 
03:06:06.389 --> 03:06:06.399 align:start position:0%
same facilities so without having to
 
03:06:08.950 --> 03:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
recreate the wheel so to speak so i did
 
03:06:10.950 --> 03:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
talk to anthony about that he's trying
 
03:06:13.190 --> 03:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
to clean that language up over an ols
 
03:06:15.269 --> 03:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
but the intention was to have you to be
 
03:06:16.790 --> 03:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
able to get a parallel for-profit
 
03:06:17.750 --> 03:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
license to be able to use your
 
03:06:19.510 --> 03:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities to sell to the
 
03:06:21.349 --> 03:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
state for what you're growing
 
03:06:21.359 --> 03:06:22.150 align:start position:0%
state for what you're growing
okay

03:06:22.150 --> 03:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:06:23.910 --> 03:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that i have no idea how it
 
03:06:25.750 --> 03:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
would work and that's the kind of thing
 
03:06:26.830 --> 03:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
on that but
 
03:06:29.510 --> 03:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
just can i just we got to clean that up
 
03:06:31.510 --> 03:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
with a second mr chair
 
03:06:34.070 --> 03:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
so you said license but but we're
 
03:06:36.230 --> 03:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
talking about incorporation
 
03:06:37.990 --> 03:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
that they want to incorporate as a
 
03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:39.429 align:start position:0%
that they want to incorporate as a
for-profit

03:06:39.429 --> 03:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
for-profit
 
03:06:40.950 --> 03:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
is that in the language
 
03:06:43.190 --> 03:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
so again the the intention would be just
 
03:06:45.110 --> 03:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
like following any of the other lang any
 
03:06:47.030 --> 03:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
other provisions under the licenses that
 
03:06:49.190 --> 03:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
are granted here they would just have to
 
03:06:50.870 --> 03:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
form a corporation that's for profit and
 
03:06:53.030 --> 03:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
be able to apply for a license and and
 
03:06:53.040 --> 03:06:54.150 align:start position:0%
be able to apply for a license and and
state

03:06:54.150 --> 03:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:06:56.550 --> 03:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
and we'd be allowing if i could finish
 
03:06:58.150 --> 03:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
we'd be allowing basically that their
 
03:06:59.670 --> 03:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
current facilities could be used for
 
03:07:01.110 --> 03:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
both the not-for-profit and for-profit
 
03:07:01.120 --> 03:07:02.230 align:start position:0%
both the not-for-profit and for-profit
services

03:07:02.230 --> 03:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:07:03.910 --> 03:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding mr chair
 
03:07:05.830 --> 03:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
chair is that we had a there was a bill
 
03:07:07.910 --> 03:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
right that didn't make it through to do
 
03:07:10.790 --> 03:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
that correct senate bill 38 uh was
 
03:07:12.870 --> 03:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
vetoed last year it was veto right two
 
03:07:14.710 --> 03:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
votes short of the override in the house
 
03:07:14.720 --> 03:07:15.830 align:start position:0%
votes short of the override in the house
yeah

03:07:15.830 --> 03:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:07:18.230 --> 03:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
so so it passed it passed the house on
 
03:07:20.150 --> 03:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
the senate senate in the house
 
03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
yeah senate house correct but the
 
03:07:25.269 --> 03:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
governor vetoed it okay so so
 
03:07:26.790 --> 03:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
again that's enough so again this isn't
 
03:07:28.309 --> 03:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
the retail side so we're not letting
 
03:07:30.230 --> 03:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
them sell we're letting them cultivate
 
03:07:33.110 --> 03:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
manufacture and transport to the state
 
03:07:36.830 --> 03:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:38.150 --> 03:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
03:07:40.150 --> 03:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh and uh thank you mr chairman to add
 
03:07:41.110 --> 03:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
to that i think there are other
 
03:07:43.269 --> 03:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
discussions that are going on with other
 
03:07:43.279 --> 03:07:44.950 align:start position:0%
discussions that are going on with other
processes

03:07:44.950 --> 03:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
processes
 
03:07:46.950 --> 03:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
that are okay with that but we'll see
 
03:07:49.110 --> 03:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
when we get there on that um i want to
 
03:07:51.030 --> 03:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
switch gears for just a moment if i can
 
03:07:51.040 --> 03:07:52.070 align:start position:0%
switch gears for just a moment if i can
and

03:07:52.070 --> 03:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:07:53.910 --> 03:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
and ask mr simon thank you so much for
 
03:07:55.269 --> 03:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
being here because i think that your
 
03:07:56.469 --> 03:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
knowledge is
 
03:07:59.590 --> 03:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
is the wealth that we're looking for um
 
03:08:01.030 --> 03:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
mr simon
 
03:08:03.190 --> 03:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
would you please explain to the
 
03:08:03.200 --> 03:08:04.230 align:start position:0%
would you please explain to the
committee

03:08:04.230 --> 03:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:08:07.349 --> 03:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
about vaping cartridges about vaping and
 
03:08:09.670 --> 03:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
how it comes from flour and or
 
03:08:11.590 --> 03:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
concentrate in or because you i know
 
03:08:13.269 --> 03:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
that you have a lot of information about
 
03:08:15.510 --> 03:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
this and i think this is confusing when
 
03:08:17.269 --> 03:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
we talk about vaping
 
03:08:18.870 --> 03:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
people don't know that you can put the
 
03:08:21.030 --> 03:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
flour inside a pen
 
03:08:24.150 --> 03:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
and it heats it up and then you take in
 
03:08:25.110 --> 03:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
the vape
 
03:08:26.790 --> 03:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
so that's just like
 
03:08:28.469 --> 03:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
it's better for you i think than smoking
 
03:08:31.750 --> 03:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:34.150 --> 03:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm a little crass i apologize
 
03:08:35.830 --> 03:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh but could you could you explain that
 
03:08:37.190 --> 03:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
just a little bit for us
 
03:08:38.710 --> 03:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh yeah are you talking about whole
 
03:08:40.790 --> 03:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
flower vaping is that what you mean and
 
03:08:42.469 --> 03:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
differentiating that between when we
 
03:08:44.070 --> 03:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
usually talk about
 
03:08:45.429 --> 03:08:45.439 align:start position:0%
vaping and certainly in the context of
 
03:08:47.590 --> 03:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
nicotine people are
 
03:08:49.510 --> 03:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with the e-cigarettes they have
 
03:08:51.830 --> 03:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
little heating elements batteries they
 
03:08:53.990 --> 03:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
heat the chamber the liquid is heated
 
03:08:56.630 --> 03:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
you inhale the vapor it's healthier than
 
03:08:58.389 --> 03:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
smoking because there's no tar there's
 
03:09:00.710 --> 03:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
no carbon monoxide
 
03:09:02.389 --> 03:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
the other by-products of combustion are
 
03:09:05.269 --> 03:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
not present so it's a cleaner product uh
 
03:09:06.870 --> 03:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
the same sorts of
 
03:09:08.870 --> 03:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
vape cartridges are made using cannabis
 
03:09:11.429 --> 03:09:11.439 align:start position:0%
oil and you'll see those pretty commonly
 
03:09:14.150 --> 03:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
in in the marketplace and uh frankly
 
03:09:16.950 --> 03:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
there are unregulated hemp derived
 
03:09:18.950 --> 03:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
thc vapes that you can buy in any vape
 
03:09:20.229 --> 03:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
shop in new hampshire and they're
 
03:09:22.150 --> 03:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
psychoactive and i think they should be
 
03:09:24.070 --> 03:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
part of this discussion about how we
 
03:09:25.590 --> 03:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
regulate cannabis and so far they
 
03:09:27.510 --> 03:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
haven't been but people are very
 
03:09:29.990 --> 03:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with the idea that oil is is in
 
03:09:32.150 --> 03:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
cartridges but people also as a
 
03:09:34.710 --> 03:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
representative suggests vape the whole
 
03:09:37.110 --> 03:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
flower which can be done by grinding it
 
03:09:39.349 --> 03:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
up and putting it in essentially there
 
03:09:40.950 --> 03:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
are these different types of vaporizers
 
03:09:42.150 --> 03:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
that have different types of heating
 
03:09:43.750 --> 03:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
elements some of them have fan some of
 
03:09:45.590 --> 03:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
them don't but the whole point is it
 
03:09:47.750 --> 03:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
heats the flower up to a temperature
 
03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
that is below the point of combustion it
 
03:09:51.670 --> 03:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
releases the cannabinoids you're able to
 
03:09:53.510 --> 03:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
inhale the thc and the other
 
03:09:56.309 --> 03:09:56.319 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids without tar carbon monoxide
 
03:09:57.429 --> 03:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
and that's something that a lot of our
 
03:09:59.030 --> 03:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
patients at prime
 
03:10:01.429 --> 03:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
is how they prefer to consume flour but
 
03:10:03.190 --> 03:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
as far as this bill goes that would all
 
03:10:06.309 --> 03:10:06.319 align:start position:0%
be under flour whether it's used
 
03:10:08.710 --> 03:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
smoked whether it's vaporized in the
 
03:10:10.710 --> 03:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
manner i just described or if somebody
 
03:10:12.389 --> 03:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
buys flour and makes their own edibles
 
03:10:13.830 --> 03:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
out of it or something like that it
 
03:10:17.190 --> 03:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
would all be under that same category
 
03:10:18.790 --> 03:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for the follow-up
 
03:10:21.030 --> 03:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh mr simon that
 
03:10:23.750 --> 03:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
does do the atcs consider
 
03:10:23.760 --> 03:10:25.990 align:start position:0%
does do the atcs consider
concentrates

03:10:25.990 --> 03:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
concentrates
 
03:10:29.830 --> 03:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
such such as those other types of vaping
 
03:10:29.840 --> 03:10:31.269 align:start position:0%
such such as those other types of vaping
materials

03:10:31.269 --> 03:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
materials
 
03:10:34.710 --> 03:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
also part of the flower industry
 
03:10:36.150 --> 03:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
is that an easy enough question or is
 
03:10:38.229 --> 03:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
that too convoluted
 
03:10:39.990 --> 03:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
i mean generally the way we look at it
 
03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:41.030 align:start position:0%
i mean generally the way we look at it
is

03:10:41.030 --> 03:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:10:42.309 --> 03:10:42.319 align:start position:0%
pretty much tracks with how our
 
03:10:45.030 --> 03:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
regulators look at it uh and and our
 
03:10:46.870 --> 03:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
regulators have a category called
 
03:10:48.710 --> 03:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis infused products
 
03:10:51.269 --> 03:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
and that is a broad category that that
 
03:10:53.670 --> 03:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
encompasses all of all the infused
 
03:10:56.070 --> 03:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
products so there's flour and then
 
03:10:56.080 --> 03:10:56.790 align:start position:0%
products so there's flour and then
there's

03:10:56.790 --> 03:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:10:59.670 --> 03:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
cip cannabis infused products so if this
 
03:11:01.190 --> 03:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
is going to move forward i would suggest
 
03:11:03.269 --> 03:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
that some of the definitions in in the
 
03:11:05.030 --> 03:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
amendment of the bill need to be
 
03:11:07.110 --> 03:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
adjusted to match the existing
 
03:11:09.030 --> 03:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program for example
 
03:11:11.030 --> 03:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
the word medical isn't in in the medical
 
03:11:12.630 --> 03:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis bill it is a therapeutic
 
03:11:14.710 --> 03:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis bill
 
03:11:16.469 --> 03:11:16.479 align:start position:0%
patients don't use cannabis for medical
 
03:11:19.190 --> 03:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
use they use it for therapeutic use
 
03:11:20.870 --> 03:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
it is a written certification not a
 
03:11:22.950 --> 03:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
prescription things like that would need
 
03:11:25.990 --> 03:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
to be trued up to the existing policy
 
03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:28.710 align:start position:0%
to be trued up to the existing policy
so

03:11:28.710 --> 03:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:28.720 --> 03:11:29.830 align:start position:0%
 
edibles

03:11:29.830 --> 03:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
edibles
 
03:11:34.150 --> 03:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:34.160 --> 03:11:35.110 align:start position:0%
 
box

03:11:35.110 --> 03:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
box
 
03:11:35.120 --> 03:11:36.950 align:start position:0%
box
as

03:11:36.950 --> 03:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:11:38.790 --> 03:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
let's say the
 
03:11:38.800 --> 03:11:40.150 align:start position:0%
let's say the
vaping

03:11:40.150 --> 03:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
vaping
 
03:11:41.349 --> 03:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
and other
 
03:11:43.190 --> 03:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
edibles is
 
03:11:44.790 --> 03:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
something you put in your mouth and your
 
03:11:44.800 --> 03:11:45.590 align:start position:0%
something you put in your mouth and your
chew

03:11:45.590 --> 03:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
chew
 
03:11:47.190 --> 03:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
most people would agree with you i'm
 
03:11:49.590 --> 03:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
just saying that under our rules of the
 
03:11:51.910 --> 03:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program cannabis
 
03:11:54.229 --> 03:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
infused products include edibles and
 
03:11:58.630 --> 03:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:01.349 --> 03:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
because they're all infused
 
03:12:02.950 --> 03:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
03:12:05.110 --> 03:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
can i just ask mr simon if you wouldn't
 
03:12:06.950 --> 03:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
mind shoot me an email with some of the
 
03:12:08.469 --> 03:12:08.479 align:start position:0%
definition things that'll clean up some
 
03:12:10.309 --> 03:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
of the language and i'll look at that
 
03:12:11.990 --> 03:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
and see if we can integrate it into the
 
03:12:17.269 --> 03:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:19.750 --> 03:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
further comments or questions
 
03:12:22.150 --> 03:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
no i think
 
03:12:25.269 --> 03:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
and then representative brownie
 
03:12:27.830 --> 03:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
followed by representative tucker so
 
03:12:29.190 --> 03:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you saw the list i had
 
03:12:30.950 --> 03:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
so we had edibles injector and
 
03:12:30.960 --> 03:12:33.190 align:start position:0%
so we had edibles injector and
ingestibles

03:12:33.190 --> 03:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
ingestibles
 
03:12:35.510 --> 03:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
which in some state includes
 
03:12:35.520 --> 03:12:36.870 align:start position:0%
which in some state includes
sodas

03:12:36.870 --> 03:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
sodas
 
03:12:39.510 --> 03:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:41.670 --> 03:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
yes so and soda
 
03:12:43.510 --> 03:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
sorts of things right right and some
 
03:12:45.750 --> 03:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
states have it in beer but but i think
 
03:12:47.269 --> 03:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
the commit
 
03:12:48.870 --> 03:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
i know sure was studying this in the in
 
03:12:50.389 --> 03:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
the commission that was beer and i we
 
03:12:51.590 --> 03:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
said no make sure it doesn't go into
 
03:12:52.950 --> 03:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
beer although in this case with the
 
03:12:55.269 --> 03:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
liquor commission it makes sense but
 
03:12:57.670 --> 03:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
but so we got pre-rolls
 
03:13:00.389 --> 03:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
so pre-rolls how popular is that getting
 
03:13:02.630 --> 03:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
well i i i not not just so not
 
03:13:04.710 --> 03:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily in your your
 
03:13:07.030 --> 03:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
your world but the recreational world
 
03:13:08.630 --> 03:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so those are the kinds of questions
 
03:13:11.349 --> 03:13:11.359 align:start position:0%
that i would ask our ceo and ceo they
 
03:13:13.030 --> 03:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
could give us exact numbers if we wanted
 
03:13:14.790 --> 03:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
them what they are in our market and i
 
03:13:15.990 --> 03:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
could tell you what they are in other
 
03:13:18.469 --> 03:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
markets but i'm i'm not a i'm not a
 
03:13:18.479 --> 03:13:19.990 align:start position:0%
markets but i'm i'm not a i'm not a
marketplace

03:13:19.990 --> 03:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
03:13:22.790 --> 03:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
expert i'm not a grower and i'm not a
 
03:13:24.950 --> 03:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
you know i'm the pr guy in the lobbyist
 
03:13:26.790 --> 03:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
and i i've been all through the
 
03:13:28.070 --> 03:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
facilities i've asked a million
 
03:13:29.990 --> 03:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
questions but there's a lot that i don't
 
03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:32.150 align:start position:0%
questions but there's a lot that i don't
know

03:13:32.150 --> 03:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:13:33.429 --> 03:13:33.439 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
03:13:35.750 --> 03:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
the only accessories that would be that
 
03:13:37.349 --> 03:13:37.359 align:start position:0%
would be outside of this
 
03:13:39.349 --> 03:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
they the stores would sell accessories
 
03:13:40.830 --> 03:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
but they would get from other kind of
 
03:13:43.269 --> 03:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
manufacturers so right that's very small
 
03:13:47.030 --> 03:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
percentage topicals that's the ointments
 
03:13:49.750 --> 03:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
that that absorb through the skin
 
03:13:51.670 --> 03:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
and that's a very small percentage
 
03:13:54.070 --> 03:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
flour is the cartridges we just talked
 
03:13:54.080 --> 03:13:55.030 align:start position:0%
flour is the cartridges we just talked
about

03:13:55.030 --> 03:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:13:57.269 --> 03:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
and concentrates so it concentrates the
 
03:13:59.590 --> 03:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
dabbing stuff right you take its waxes
 
03:14:01.590 --> 03:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
you put it in this heating device and
 
03:14:01.600 --> 03:14:03.429 align:start position:0%
you put it in this heating device and
it's

03:14:03.429 --> 03:14:03.439 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:14:05.510 --> 03:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
you wanna explain how that works you
 
03:14:06.550 --> 03:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
could probably do a better job than i
 
03:14:09.429 --> 03:14:09.439 align:start position:0%
can on that sure
 
03:14:12.150 --> 03:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
so yeah the the most potent forms of
 
03:14:14.630 --> 03:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis that are available to consumers
 
03:14:17.590 --> 03:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
are concentrates uh they you know
 
03:14:19.030 --> 03:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
they're readily available in the
 
03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and maine markets you'll
 
03:14:24.389 --> 03:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
see them with thc concentrations uh into
 
03:14:27.590 --> 03:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
the 90 percentile and above
 
03:14:30.309 --> 03:14:30.319 align:start position:0%
and and the appeal of these products is
 
03:14:31.990 --> 03:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know as opposed to if you're a
 
03:14:33.510 --> 03:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
regular consumer of cannabis and you
 
03:14:35.110 --> 03:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
have a high tolerance you don't want to
 
03:14:36.630 --> 03:14:36.640 align:start position:0%
smoke a whole joint every time you're
 
03:14:37.750 --> 03:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
going to get
 
03:14:38.710 --> 03:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
looking for the effect that you're
 
03:14:41.030 --> 03:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
03:14:43.269 --> 03:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
if i make the analogy to beer you
 
03:14:45.190 --> 03:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to drink 12 beers if it
 
03:14:47.750 --> 03:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
took you 12 beers to get the buzz that
 
03:14:49.670 --> 03:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
you want so some people prefer to sip
 
03:14:49.680 --> 03:14:50.630 align:start position:0%
you want so some people prefer to sip
bourbon

03:14:50.630 --> 03:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
bourbon
 
03:14:53.030 --> 03:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's healthier because there
 
03:14:56.229 --> 03:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
are fewer carbs and less less impurities
 
03:14:58.070 --> 03:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
you're getting the pure substance
 
03:15:00.150 --> 03:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
so the way these products work you you
 
03:15:00.160 --> 03:15:01.670 align:start position:0%
so the way these products work you you
either

03:15:01.670 --> 03:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
either
 
03:15:03.830 --> 03:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
they're a variety of devices that will
 
03:15:05.990 --> 03:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
reach the desired temperature you take a
 
03:15:07.830 --> 03:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
small amount of the concentrate touch it
 
03:15:10.150 --> 03:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
to the device and it releases the vapor
 
03:15:11.830 --> 03:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
that you then inhale
 
03:15:14.870 --> 03:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
and the appeal is that it's
 
03:15:17.830 --> 03:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
more pure and and
 
03:15:21.269 --> 03:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
achieves the effect very quickly without
 
03:15:23.190 --> 03:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
the impurities and the smoke involved
 
03:15:31.910 --> 03:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:34.469 --> 03:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
she had her
 
03:15:36.389 --> 03:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
03:15:38.950 --> 03:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
so the question about um with with the
 
03:15:41.510 --> 03:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
products that are sold either through
 
03:15:41.520 --> 03:15:42.389 align:start position:0%
products that are sold either through
the

03:15:42.389 --> 03:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:15:45.910 --> 03:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
nonprofits or just in general
 
03:15:48.070 --> 03:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
are there any labeling requirements that
 
03:15:50.630 --> 03:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
are placed on these products with so far
 
03:15:50.640 --> 03:15:51.590 align:start position:0%
are placed on these products with so far
as

03:15:51.590 --> 03:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:15:53.349 --> 03:15:53.359 align:start position:0%
how they might affect somebody's blood
 
03:15:55.429 --> 03:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
pressure or
 
03:15:57.190 --> 03:15:57.200 align:start position:0%
interfere with any other medications
 
03:15:59.110 --> 03:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
they may be taking or
 
03:16:01.349 --> 03:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
pregnancy or any of that any kind of
 
03:16:02.630 --> 03:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
labeling requirements that you have to
 
03:16:03.670 --> 03:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
03:16:05.349 --> 03:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
yes so the department of health and
 
03:16:07.429 --> 03:16:07.439 align:start position:0%
service human services has adopted
 
03:16:09.830 --> 03:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
detailed rules uh all of our products
 
03:16:11.590 --> 03:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
are required to be independently lab
 
03:16:13.910 --> 03:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
testing lab tested
 
03:16:16.950 --> 03:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
for the potency the cannabinoid profile
 
03:16:19.190 --> 03:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
so all of the labels include the
 
03:16:21.830 --> 03:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
cannabinoid profiles how much thc how
 
03:16:24.550 --> 03:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
much cbd how much cbn how much cbg
 
03:16:26.790 --> 03:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
things like that it's also independently
 
03:16:29.750 --> 03:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
lab tested for impurities including
 
03:16:29.760 --> 03:16:32.070 align:start position:0%
lab tested for impurities including
microbials

03:16:32.070 --> 03:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
microbials
 
03:16:34.870 --> 03:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
heavy metals pesticides it's one of the
 
03:16:37.269 --> 03:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
major marketplace concerns when you have
 
03:16:39.030 --> 03:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
unregulated cannabis and frankly the
 
03:16:41.750 --> 03:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
biggest issue in maine is that while
 
03:16:43.349 --> 03:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
they are requiring independent lab
 
03:16:45.110 --> 03:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
testing for their adult use market and
 
03:16:47.269 --> 03:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
they have this robust caregiver driven
 
03:16:49.429 --> 03:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
medical market where independent lab
 
03:16:51.750 --> 03:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
testing is optional so it's one of the
 
03:16:52.870 --> 03:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
concerns that we have it's one of the
 
03:16:54.790 --> 03:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
reason maine medical cannabis is so much
 
03:16:56.150 --> 03:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
cheaper is they don't have that
 
03:16:57.990 --> 03:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
requirement so a lot of new hampshire
 
03:16:59.190 --> 03:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
patients are going to maine for the
 
03:16:59.200 --> 03:17:00.070 align:start position:0%
patients are going to maine for the
cheaper

03:17:00.070 --> 03:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
cheaper
 
03:17:02.469 --> 03:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
products but the labels minimally have
 
03:17:05.190 --> 03:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
all the cannabinoids and certifies that
 
03:17:07.670 --> 03:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
it does not have the the impurities that
 
03:17:09.910 --> 03:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
it passed the testing on that now
 
03:17:11.910 --> 03:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
brought more broadly to your question
 
03:17:11.920 --> 03:17:13.269 align:start position:0%
brought more broadly to your question
we've

03:17:13.269 --> 03:17:13.279 align:start position:0%
we've
 
03:17:15.110 --> 03:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
worked with our regulators and with the
 
03:17:16.870 --> 03:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board we've developed
 
03:17:19.429 --> 03:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
educational materials on on questions
 
03:17:20.870 --> 03:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
such as
 
03:17:22.389 --> 03:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
cannabis use while breastfeeding
 
03:17:24.309 --> 03:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis use during pregnancy
 
03:17:27.349 --> 03:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis used by minors any other issue
 
03:17:29.269 --> 03:17:29.279 align:start position:0%
that is important because we understand
 
03:17:30.469 --> 03:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
that our patients are very often
 
03:17:32.070 --> 03:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
beginning with a very low
 
03:17:33.750 --> 03:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge level in many cases they've
 
03:17:36.150 --> 03:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
never tried cannabis they're coming to
 
03:17:38.870 --> 03:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
us for help to to use it
 
03:17:40.870 --> 03:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
and get the effects that they want
 
03:17:43.030 --> 03:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
and they're not looking to get
 
03:17:44.630 --> 03:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
stoned for the most part they're looking
 
03:17:46.550 --> 03:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
to feel better and we want to help them
 
03:17:48.150 --> 03:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
do that and make sure they're aware of
 
03:17:49.349 --> 03:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
any potential
 
03:17:50.550 --> 03:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
negatives so we have a lot of
 
03:17:52.070 --> 03:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
educational materials that are geared
 
03:17:54.150 --> 03:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
toward that and we encourage every
 
03:17:55.990 --> 03:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
patient that registers
 
03:17:57.830 --> 03:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
to come in for a consultation especially
 
03:17:59.590 --> 03:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
if they're not familiar with cannabis to
 
03:18:01.590 --> 03:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
sit down with one of our staff members
 
03:18:03.429 --> 03:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
talk about what their goals are what
 
03:18:04.870 --> 03:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
they hope to achieve through their
 
03:18:08.309 --> 03:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis use and what products uh and
 
03:18:10.469 --> 03:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
what regimen might be most beneficial
 
03:18:12.309 --> 03:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
for them
 
03:18:16.389 --> 03:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
okay can i representative so
 
03:18:16.399 --> 03:18:17.830 align:start position:0%
okay can i representative so
so

03:18:17.830 --> 03:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:18:20.309 --> 03:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
here's my kids what i'm still not
 
03:18:21.429 --> 03:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
certain about
 
03:18:23.510 --> 03:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
edibles i'm just going to use this from
 
03:18:26.469 --> 03:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
i got this from flow hub
 
03:18:29.429 --> 03:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
18 was edibles and injectables
 
03:18:31.269 --> 03:18:31.279 align:start position:0%
but then down the bottom we have 26
 
03:18:33.750 --> 03:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
percent of cartridges
 
03:18:35.750 --> 03:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
and we have 14 percentage concentrates
 
03:18:37.030 --> 03:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
that we just talked now that we kind of
 
03:18:38.790 --> 03:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
define the terms
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
and then flour was 33 percent and then
 
03:18:42.870 --> 03:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
then it was for minor for the pre-rolls
 
03:18:44.550 --> 03:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
were seven percent
 
03:18:47.030 --> 03:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
so i'm assuming that
 
03:18:49.750 --> 03:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
you're vertically integrated correct
 
03:18:51.269 --> 03:18:51.279 align:start position:0%
so you do the growing you have you do
 
03:18:53.349 --> 03:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing job so
 
03:18:54.870 --> 03:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
which is probably a better business
 
03:18:57.030 --> 03:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
model than we're talking about here
 
03:18:59.190 --> 03:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
because you kind of make
 
03:19:01.269 --> 03:19:01.279 align:start position:0%
not that you're a for-profit but
 
03:19:03.030 --> 03:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
it is
 
03:19:05.429 --> 03:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
it cascades down and and unless even in
 
03:19:07.590 --> 03:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
the recreational markets that are a lot
 
03:19:09.670 --> 03:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
of those are are vertically integrated
 
03:19:12.309 --> 03:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
they make money at each step of the way
 
03:19:12.319 --> 03:19:13.670 align:start position:0%
they make money at each step of the way
here

03:19:13.670 --> 03:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:19:15.590 --> 03:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to have private companies
 
03:19:17.830 --> 03:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
making they have to make a profit for
 
03:19:19.830 --> 03:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
growing and the manufacturers which and
 
03:19:20.630 --> 03:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
i have one more question to
 
03:19:22.309 --> 03:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturers but manufacturers they're
 
03:19:24.070 --> 03:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
going to make some money along the way
 
03:19:25.670 --> 03:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
so for this to retail we're not going to
 
03:19:27.429 --> 03:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
make as much much money as if we were
 
03:19:29.590 --> 03:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
vertically integrated we're not even we
 
03:19:31.349 --> 03:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
can't even consider that because that
 
03:19:33.429 --> 03:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
policy is set that it's just going to be
 
03:19:35.349 --> 03:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
retail we're going to private enterprise
 
03:19:37.429 --> 03:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
for the other two
 
03:19:37.439 --> 03:19:38.550 align:start position:0%
for the other two
so

03:19:38.550 --> 03:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:19:38.560 --> 03:19:40.469 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:19:40.469 --> 03:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:42.070 --> 03:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
03:19:43.190 --> 03:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
how how are we going to track
 
03:19:43.200 --> 03:19:46.070 align:start position:0%
how how are we going to track
manufacturers

03:19:46.070 --> 03:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
03:19:47.510 --> 03:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
i see i'm not sure if we're going to
 
03:19:50.389 --> 03:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
sell on the stars from the current the
 
03:19:55.830 --> 03:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:57.750 --> 03:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
technically we're not doing edibles and
 
03:19:59.590 --> 03:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
injectables other than people the way
 
03:20:01.510 --> 03:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
the bill stands right now without our
 
03:20:01.520 --> 03:20:02.950 align:start position:0%
the bill stands right now without our
corrections

03:20:02.950 --> 03:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
03:20:05.190 --> 03:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
edibles and injectables
 
03:20:08.150 --> 03:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
and ingestibles okay so i'm not aware of
 
03:20:09.429 --> 03:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
any injectable
 
03:20:10.550 --> 03:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
no no no
 
03:20:10.560 --> 03:20:11.990 align:start position:0%
no no no
ingestibles

03:20:11.990 --> 03:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
ingestibles
 
03:20:12.000 --> 03:20:13.510 align:start position:0%
ingestibles
ingestibles

03:20:13.510 --> 03:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
ingestibles
 
03:20:13.520 --> 03:20:14.469 align:start position:0%
ingestibles
it's

03:20:14.469 --> 03:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:20:17.910 --> 03:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:17.920 --> 03:20:19.190 align:start position:0%
 
without

03:20:19.190 --> 03:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
without
 
03:20:21.030 --> 03:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
eating it i don't know that's they're
 
03:20:23.269 --> 03:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
not just the phraseology that's used in
 
03:20:26.229 --> 03:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
the market i didn't come up with this
 
03:20:27.510 --> 03:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
because there are drinks too i guess
 
03:20:29.670 --> 03:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
that's suggesting you know anyway right
 
03:20:29.680 --> 03:20:31.269 align:start position:0%
that's suggesting you know anyway right
so

03:20:31.269 --> 03:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:20:31.279 --> 03:20:32.790 align:start position:0%
so
so

03:20:32.790 --> 03:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:20:37.990 --> 03:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:40.710 --> 03:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
that pre-rolls again that's the service
 
03:20:42.550 --> 03:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
i mean if it's that's clearly i guess we
 
03:20:44.950 --> 03:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
consider that part of loose if
 
03:20:46.469 --> 03:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
it's a convenient service to do
 
03:20:48.469 --> 03:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
pre-rolls and that's that that's fine
 
03:20:51.750 --> 03:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
but we need a manufacturer to do that
 
03:20:54.710 --> 03:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
right unless we think the our our our
 
03:20:56.630 --> 03:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
stores are going to do that in the back
 
03:20:58.790 --> 03:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
room somewhere
 
03:21:00.790 --> 03:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh topicals that's definitely a
 
03:21:02.710 --> 03:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturing thing
 
03:21:04.870 --> 03:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
right cartridges is a manufacturing
 
03:21:06.950 --> 03:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
thing and concentrates it's a constant
 
03:21:08.630 --> 03:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
because they're they're extracting the
 
03:21:11.349 --> 03:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
whatever they need to create these
 
03:21:11.359 --> 03:21:13.750 align:start position:0%
whatever they need to create these
concentrates

03:21:13.750 --> 03:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
concentrates
 
03:21:13.760 --> 03:21:15.190 align:start position:0%
concentrates
so

03:21:15.190 --> 03:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:15.200 --> 03:21:16.389 align:start position:0%
so
what

03:21:16.389 --> 03:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:21:18.870 --> 03:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
so are we going to say to manufacturers
 
03:21:20.630 --> 03:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
yes concentrates are going to be sold
 
03:21:22.630 --> 03:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
and cartridges going to be sold and
 
03:21:24.070 --> 03:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
pre-rolls are going to be sold and
 
03:21:26.309 --> 03:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
topicals are going to be sold
 
03:21:27.590 --> 03:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
in our
 
03:21:30.710 --> 03:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
we in our state-run stores
 
03:21:30.720 --> 03:21:31.990 align:start position:0%
we in our state-run stores
or

03:21:31.990 --> 03:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:21:33.349 --> 03:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
are we not
 
03:21:36.830 --> 03:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:39.349 --> 03:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
huh manufacturing has to happen in new
 
03:21:42.389 --> 03:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire you can't import this stuff
 
03:21:42.399 --> 03:21:43.750 align:start position:0%
hampshire you can't import this stuff
technically

03:21:43.750 --> 03:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
technically
 
03:21:46.710 --> 03:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
so i i don't want to confuse matters but
 
03:21:48.630 --> 03:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
if if we say no to that how are we going
 
03:21:51.030 --> 03:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
to track how we're going to track if if
 
03:21:52.630 --> 03:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
if we are going to sell these products
 
03:21:54.710 --> 03:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
in our stores
 
03:21:58.790 --> 03:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
then we need manufacturers to do that
 
03:22:01.269 --> 03:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
so how do we attract manufacturers if
 
03:22:02.389 --> 03:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do edibles and
 
03:22:02.399 --> 03:22:05.349 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do edibles and
ingestibles

03:22:05.349 --> 03:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:09.429 --> 03:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:11.670 --> 03:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
no no no no no i think you know it's a
 
03:22:13.190 --> 03:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
good question and it is certainly
 
03:22:15.110 --> 03:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
confusing that every state seems to have
 
03:22:16.469 --> 03:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
a slightly different system of
 
03:22:18.790 --> 03:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
classifying what is an infused product
 
03:22:21.510 --> 03:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
versus an edible versus something else
 
03:22:23.510 --> 03:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
but any way you slice it there will be a
 
03:22:24.550 --> 03:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
need for
 
03:22:26.550 --> 03:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to produce all of these
 
03:22:28.630 --> 03:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
products i think pre-rolls could be done
 
03:22:30.630 --> 03:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
by cultivators if the rules are
 
03:22:32.630 --> 03:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
sufficient that's really easy it's just
 
03:22:34.710 --> 03:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
an extension of trimming so you can't
 
03:22:38.870 --> 03:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:41.269 --> 03:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
i'm not entirely sure what the precise
 
03:22:43.910 --> 03:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
question was but i agree i would i would
 
03:22:45.750 --> 03:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
agree that it's complicated and i can't
 
03:22:48.950 --> 03:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
give you a final answer something we can
 
03:22:52.469 --> 03:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
just discuss further on monday
 
03:22:53.910 --> 03:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
i just think we need to define these
 
03:22:55.990 --> 03:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
terms as to what's in and out
 
03:22:57.830 --> 03:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
yeah let me let me comment on that if i
 
03:22:57.840 --> 03:22:59.910 align:start position:0%
yeah let me let me comment on that if i
may

03:22:59.910 --> 03:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
may
 
03:23:02.150 --> 03:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
and really the point is what i want to
 
03:23:03.910 --> 03:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
say is to agree with you
 
03:23:06.070 --> 03:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative romney we really need a
 
03:23:09.030 --> 03:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
clear definition of what's in or out
 
03:23:11.110 --> 03:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
and looking through this bill i don't
 
03:23:12.389 --> 03:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
find it
 
03:23:15.590 --> 03:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
i don't find a clear definition
 
03:23:18.710 --> 03:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
and it's pretty important given
 
03:23:18.720 --> 03:23:20.150 align:start position:0%
and it's pretty important given
well

03:23:20.150 --> 03:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:23:22.469 --> 03:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
given how it plays out in terms of the
 
03:23:25.110 --> 03:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
state's revenue so it's directly
 
03:23:27.830 --> 03:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
implicated into our job here
 
03:23:27.840 --> 03:23:29.190 align:start position:0%
implicated into our job here
so

03:23:29.190 --> 03:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:23:31.910 --> 03:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative lange
 
03:23:33.429 --> 03:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
in your amendment do you have a
 
03:23:35.590 --> 03:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
definition of it so i was just looking
 
03:23:37.590 --> 03:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
at mr chair and the only thing i i'm
 
03:23:38.790 --> 03:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
trying to see how they're using the
 
03:23:41.429 --> 03:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
definition but it just on on page 2
 
03:23:41.439 --> 03:23:42.630 align:start position:0%
definition but it just on on page 2
section

03:23:42.630 --> 03:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:23:44.870 --> 03:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
line 31 it says cannabis products means
 
03:23:46.550 --> 03:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
concentrated cannabis products and
 
03:23:48.229 --> 03:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
cannabis products that are compromised
 
03:23:49.349 --> 03:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
of cannabis
 
03:23:51.190 --> 03:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
that makes sense and in other
 
03:23:52.870 --> 03:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
ingredients are intended for use or
 
03:23:55.510 --> 03:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
consumption such as but not limited to
 
03:23:59.830 --> 03:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
edible products ointments and tinctures
 
03:23:59.840 --> 03:24:00.550 align:start position:0%
edible products ointments and tinctures
so

03:24:00.550 --> 03:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:24:03.590 --> 03:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's the one i was looking at that too
 
03:24:06.630 --> 03:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
i can't find in the bill and maybe i'm
 
03:24:08.309 --> 03:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
blind here or
 
03:24:09.510 --> 03:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
too tired
 
03:24:09.520 --> 03:24:10.630 align:start position:0%
too tired
uh

03:24:10.630 --> 03:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:24:12.950 --> 03:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
from yesterday and the day before but uh
 
03:24:15.110 --> 03:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
i can't find the prohibition
 
03:24:33.110 --> 03:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:33.120 --> 03:24:40.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:24:40.070 --> 03:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:41.510 --> 03:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
so the university part the only thing i
 
03:24:44.710 --> 03:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
see is on page three
 
03:24:47.110 --> 03:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
starting around when it talks about
 
03:24:49.030 --> 03:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
possession limit
 
03:24:51.190 --> 03:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
it says cannabis infused products
 
03:24:52.950 --> 03:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
creating thc purchase from a retail
 
03:24:54.630 --> 03:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis store which is defined as a
 
03:24:55.990 --> 03:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
state-owned store
 
03:24:57.750 --> 03:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
shall be limited
 
03:25:00.389 --> 03:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
to medical use only
 
03:25:02.070 --> 03:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
for which the purchaser presents
 
03:25:04.229 --> 03:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
documentation permitting the use of
 
03:25:06.469 --> 03:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
cannabis for medical purposes so
 
03:25:09.510 --> 03:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
that cannabis infused products which
 
03:25:13.190 --> 03:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
again i don't see a direct definition of
 
03:25:15.110 --> 03:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
so that's probably if we have cleanup
 
03:25:19.670 --> 03:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:20.790 --> 03:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
because i don't see anything that says
 
03:25:22.389 --> 03:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
cannabis the only thing it talks about
 
03:25:28.469 --> 03:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:31.030 --> 03:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
under on page two and then three is
 
03:25:32.469 --> 03:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
where it limits
 
03:25:35.269 --> 03:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
cannabis infused products to be sold
 
03:25:41.590 --> 03:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:44.389 --> 03:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
michael oh i've done it again
 
03:25:45.670 --> 03:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
what i would
 
03:25:47.990 --> 03:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
suggest is that
 
03:25:51.349 --> 03:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
you start with the section in the bill
 
03:25:51.359 --> 03:25:52.150 align:start position:0%
you start with the section in the bill
that

03:25:52.150 --> 03:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:25:54.150 --> 03:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
commands the liquor commission to sell
 
03:25:54.160 --> 03:25:56.790 align:start position:0%
commands the liquor commission to sell
cannabis

03:25:56.790 --> 03:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:56.800 --> 03:25:57.750 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:25:57.750 --> 03:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:26:01.110 --> 03:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
clarify that command with reference to
 
03:26:03.670 --> 03:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
a definition or definitions
 
03:26:05.990 --> 03:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:07.030 align:start position:0%
it could be
cannabis

03:26:07.030 --> 03:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
03:26:08.870 --> 03:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
and you stop there but then you've got a
 
03:26:12.070 --> 03:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
definition of cannabis that covers it or
 
03:26:13.990 --> 03:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
you could say
 
03:26:15.910 --> 03:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
shall sell
 
03:26:18.550 --> 03:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis but not including
 
03:26:20.229 --> 03:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
and then you limit
 
03:26:21.990 --> 03:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
limit it
 
03:26:24.469 --> 03:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
that way but um either way it's got to
 
03:26:26.790 --> 03:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
be clear and maybe the lack of
 
03:26:29.510 --> 03:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
definition and clarity tells us that
 
03:26:31.670 --> 03:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
we've got a free hand here
 
03:26:33.190 --> 03:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
because i'm not
 
03:26:34.550 --> 03:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
seeing it
 
03:26:36.790 --> 03:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
come across my
 
03:26:39.510 --> 03:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
plate here as as clean as
 
03:26:43.110 --> 03:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's been suggested it is that's clear
 
03:26:44.550 --> 03:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
that's a good point
 
03:26:45.830 --> 03:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
i'll go through it and see what i can
 
03:26:49.110 --> 03:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
find and adapt accordingly
 
03:26:50.870 --> 03:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
03:26:54.150 --> 03:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you um uh on on page
 
03:26:56.229 --> 03:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
two section seven
 
03:26:58.389 --> 03:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh there's there is the definition of
 
03:26:58.399 --> 03:27:00.070 align:start position:0%
uh there's there is the definition of
cannabis

03:27:00.070 --> 03:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
03:27:01.910 --> 03:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
it says cannabis means all the part of
 
03:27:03.110 --> 03:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
the plants the genes cannot whether
 
03:27:04.389 --> 03:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
growing or not the seeds thereof the
 
03:27:05.910 --> 03:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
resin extracted from any part of the
 
03:27:07.670 --> 03:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
plant in every compound manufacture salt
 
03:27:09.030 --> 03:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
derivative mixture of preparation of the
 
03:27:10.389 --> 03:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
plant its seeds or its resin including
 
03:27:12.710 --> 03:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis concentrate it shall not
 
03:27:14.790 --> 03:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
include hemp fiber produced from the
 
03:27:16.710 --> 03:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
stalks oil or cake made from the seeds
 
03:27:18.150 --> 03:27:18.160 align:start position:0%
of the plant sterilized seed of the
 
03:27:20.070 --> 03:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
plant is incapable of germination or the
 
03:27:21.429 --> 03:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
weight of any other ingredient
 
03:27:23.429 --> 03:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
compounded combined with cannabis to
 
03:27:25.910 --> 03:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
prepare topical or oral administration's
 
03:27:28.309 --> 03:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
food drink or other product that's part
 
03:27:30.389 --> 03:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
of what we're talking about
 
03:27:32.870 --> 03:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
i think it gives us a start and and then
 
03:27:35.910 --> 03:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
a few more maybe if uh maybe i think
 
03:27:37.750 --> 03:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to send a a
 
03:27:40.710 --> 03:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
definitions over to tim wright if we can
 
03:27:42.309 --> 03:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
combine that with the definitions we'll
 
03:27:43.110 --> 03:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
probably be able to come up with
 
03:27:49.030 --> 03:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:51.030 --> 03:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
and as long as it touches all those
 
03:27:54.309 --> 03:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:57.190 --> 03:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
and then right
 
03:27:59.110 --> 03:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
but it does impact the red and it this
 
03:28:01.590 --> 03:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
all is pertinent because it does it does
 
03:28:03.269 --> 03:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
equal revenue
 
03:28:05.510 --> 03:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
if we eliminate concentrates that's less
 
03:28:05.520 --> 03:28:11.670 align:start position:0%
if we eliminate concentrates that's less
revenue

03:28:11.670 --> 03:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:11.680 --> 03:28:14.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:28:14.870 --> 03:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:18.710 --> 03:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:18.720 --> 03:28:20.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:28:20.469 --> 03:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:28:21.910 --> 03:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
03:28:26.389 --> 03:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:29.590 --> 03:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:31.990 --> 03:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
anything else that we need to take with
 
03:28:32.000 --> 03:28:33.429 align:start position:0%
anything else that we need to take with
us

03:28:33.429 --> 03:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:28:35.349 --> 03:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
banking just speak for one minute since
 
03:28:36.469 --> 03:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
they've been patiently sitting back
 
03:28:37.510 --> 03:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
there oh
 
03:28:39.510 --> 03:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
christy do you do you just want to just
 
03:28:40.710 --> 03:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
spend a minute since you've been sitting
 
03:28:50.469 --> 03:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:56.150 --> 03:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:58.229 --> 03:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um christy merrill
 
03:28:59.429 --> 03:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire bankers and with me
 
03:29:02.309 --> 03:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
is ryan hale um and just to be clear we
 
03:29:04.150 --> 03:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
are we are neutral on the policy of
 
03:29:06.710 --> 03:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not to legalize marijuana but
 
03:29:08.630 --> 03:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
we are just available as a resource to
 
03:29:10.630 --> 03:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
answer any questions representative lang
 
03:29:12.630 --> 03:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
was kind enough to take suggested
 
03:29:15.349 --> 03:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
language from us in terms of protective
 
03:29:17.349 --> 03:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
language for bankers
 
03:29:18.790 --> 03:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
who would like to
 
03:29:22.229 --> 03:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
bank a state-run cannabis operation
 
03:29:22.239 --> 03:29:22.950 align:start position:0%
bank a state-run cannabis operation
so

03:29:22.950 --> 03:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:29:25.830 --> 03:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
you're okay with his amendment relative
 
03:29:28.870 --> 03:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
to banking yes it looks very similar i
 
03:29:30.309 --> 03:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
will just want to just double check that
 
03:29:31.510 --> 03:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
but it looks very similar to the
 
03:29:33.670 --> 03:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
language that we provided so that was
 
03:29:37.110 --> 03:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
per our uh recommendation
 
03:29:37.120 --> 03:29:38.070 align:start position:0%
per our uh recommendation
questions

03:29:38.070 --> 03:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:29:38.080 --> 03:29:39.750 align:start position:0%
questions
um

03:29:39.750 --> 03:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:41.429 --> 03:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
this was approved by your association
 
03:29:43.429 --> 03:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
board is that correct this was approved
 
03:29:45.110 --> 03:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
by your board of yes it was whatever
 
03:29:49.030 --> 03:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:49.040 --> 03:29:50.950 align:start position:0%
 
questions

03:29:50.950 --> 03:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:29:52.070 --> 03:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:29:55.349 --> 03:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:57.429 --> 03:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
so banking goes out
 
03:29:59.590 --> 03:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
well state bank goes up the state bank
 
03:30:06.790 --> 03:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:09.030 --> 03:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
anything else we want to
 
03:30:13.269 --> 03:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:16.950 --> 03:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
if not then we will meet again monday at
 
03:30:18.710 --> 03:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock
 
03:30:20.710 --> 03:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
and the first thing
 
03:30:23.349 --> 03:30:23.359 align:start position:0%
is to take is to take care of house bill
 
03:30:23.359 --> 03:30:26.550 align:start position:0%
is to take is to take care of house bill
1584.

03:30:26.550 --> 03:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:29.030 --> 03:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative aaron and representative
 
03:30:29.040 --> 03:30:31.269 align:start position:0%
representative aaron and representative
schamberg

03:30:31.269 --> 03:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
schamberg
 
03:30:33.190 --> 03:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
are going to come up with
 
03:30:37.670 --> 03:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:41.670 --> 03:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:54.070 --> 03:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:55.990 --> 03:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
can you turn your mic on
 
03:30:59.429 --> 03:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
i said maybe if
 
03:31:02.710 --> 03:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that cannabis is
 
03:31:04.389 --> 03:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
has to be grown in new hampshire is that
 
03:31:07.510 --> 03:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a agricultural
 
03:31:07.520 --> 03:31:08.550 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a agricultural
presence

03:31:08.550 --> 03:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
presence
 
03:31:10.550 --> 03:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
and brand
 
03:31:12.469 --> 03:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
maybe just a little bit of money
 
03:31:14.389 --> 03:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
eventually can be
 
03:31:16.790 --> 03:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
go to the fares
 
03:31:19.110 --> 03:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
from the sale of
 
03:31:21.750 --> 03:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
03:31:24.309 --> 03:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative elmi
 
03:31:27.429 --> 03:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wanted to ask if
 
03:31:27.439 --> 03:31:28.550 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wanted to ask if
um

03:31:28.550 --> 03:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:32.630 --> 03:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
rebecca vlang could take a stab at
 
03:31:36.150 --> 03:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
adding into the definition
 
03:31:39.750 --> 03:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
wherever it is of a approved growing
 
03:31:42.790 --> 03:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
facility that it would be
 
03:31:42.800 --> 03:31:45.190 align:start position:0%
facility that it would be
within

03:31:45.190 --> 03:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
within
 
03:31:46.870 --> 03:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
a hoop frame
 
03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
a indoor
 
03:31:52.950 --> 03:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
on an indoor environment
 
03:31:55.830 --> 03:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
because i think it it is just about
 
03:31:59.510 --> 03:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
impossible to guarantee quality
 
03:32:02.150 --> 03:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
unless we have huge numbers of extension
 
03:32:04.389 --> 03:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
agents helping
 
03:32:04.399 --> 03:32:05.429 align:start position:0%
agents helping
yeah

03:32:05.429 --> 03:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:32:09.110 --> 03:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:11.030 --> 03:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i forgot to address this when
 
03:32:12.469 --> 03:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
i was sitting here before but i think i
 
03:32:14.870 --> 03:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
can shed some some light on this
 
03:32:16.630 --> 03:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
so currently the new hampshire atc's are
 
03:32:18.870 --> 03:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
required to be fully indoors every
 
03:32:21.269 --> 03:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
product is grown under the lights that
 
03:32:22.870 --> 03:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
is the most expensive way to grow
 
03:32:25.110 --> 03:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis it's also the best way to grow
 
03:32:27.590 --> 03:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
high quality flower
 
03:32:29.910 --> 03:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
i was in maine last week i talked to the
 
03:32:32.150 --> 03:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
owner of a company that has a medical
 
03:32:33.670 --> 03:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis dispensary and is also
 
03:32:36.309 --> 03:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
wholesaling into the adult use they have
 
03:32:38.309 --> 03:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
a greenhouse for their medical facility
 
03:32:39.910 --> 03:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
they have a greenhouse for their adult
 
03:32:43.429 --> 03:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
use this enables them to produce a much
 
03:32:43.439 --> 03:32:45.030 align:start position:0%
use this enables them to produce a much
cheaper

03:32:45.030 --> 03:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
cheaper
 
03:32:46.790 --> 03:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
product but everything has to be
 
03:32:48.950 --> 03:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
independently lab tested and that is how
 
03:32:51.349 --> 03:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
from a regulatory perspective you
 
03:32:53.269 --> 03:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
guarantee quality to the
 
03:32:54.950 --> 03:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
end consumer now they don't have that
 
03:32:56.630 --> 03:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
requirement on the medical side but they
 
03:32:59.190 --> 03:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely do on the adult use side
 
03:33:01.110 --> 03:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
vermont similarly
 
03:33:03.990 --> 03:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to make it as possible as as
 
03:33:05.670 --> 03:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
easily as possible for small-scale
 
03:33:07.670 --> 03:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
cultivators to participate they've
 
03:33:10.389 --> 03:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
they've adopted unlimited licensing
 
03:33:12.309 --> 03:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
they have six cultivation tiers
 
03:33:14.950 --> 03:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
including a very small tier that they
 
03:33:17.510 --> 03:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
designed to be very accessible
 
03:33:19.910 --> 03:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
and the way they did that is by
 
03:33:22.150 --> 03:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
requiring everything that is sold to be
 
03:33:24.150 --> 03:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
independently lab tested whether you're
 
03:33:26.150 --> 03:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
the biggest grower or the small grower
 
03:33:27.990 --> 03:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
smallest grower you have to go through
 
03:33:30.229 --> 03:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
the same testing requirements before the
 
03:33:32.870 --> 03:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
products can be sold so typically the
 
03:33:35.190 --> 03:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
best products the best flour will be
 
03:33:37.269 --> 03:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
trimmed and sold as flour everything
 
03:33:40.950 --> 03:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
else will be become trim used to produce
 
03:33:43.590 --> 03:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
oils to produce infused products and
 
03:33:45.429 --> 03:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
that is how there's a secondary market
 
03:33:47.910 --> 03:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
for the flower that isn't the very best
 
03:33:49.670 --> 03:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
so some percentage will always be grown
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
indoors it'll be the high-end flower
 
03:33:54.469 --> 03:33:54.479 align:start position:0%
but you can make costs go down quite a
 
03:33:56.630 --> 03:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
bit and frankly if neighboring states
 
03:33:57.990 --> 03:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
are allowed to grow outdoors and new
 
03:33:59.670 --> 03:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire cultivators are not allowed to
 
03:34:01.830 --> 03:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
grow outdoors even in greenhouses that
 
03:34:03.670 --> 03:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
would be a substantial market
 
03:34:06.469 --> 03:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
disadvantage for new hampshire
 
03:34:06.479 --> 03:34:07.670 align:start position:0%
disadvantage for new hampshire
so

03:34:07.670 --> 03:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:34:10.070 --> 03:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
all of these products
 
03:34:14.550 --> 03:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
are either grown indoors or they're
 
03:34:17.990 --> 03:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
all of them tested in labs
 
03:34:21.349 --> 03:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
they're all independently lab tested in
 
03:34:23.990 --> 03:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
every adult use market that i'm aware of
 
03:34:26.229 --> 03:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
in in every medical market except for
 
03:34:26.239 --> 03:34:27.510 align:start position:0%
in in every medical market except for
maine's

03:34:27.510 --> 03:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
maine's
 
03:34:29.830 --> 03:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
it's standard to have independent uh
 
03:34:31.830 --> 03:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
required lab testing for all products
 
03:34:34.229 --> 03:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
and we think that's just smart policy
 
03:34:36.710 --> 03:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you and whether it's indoor out
 
03:34:38.229 --> 03:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
it's in the bill
 
03:34:40.630 --> 03:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
yeah there's testing
 
03:34:42.150 --> 03:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's i don't think there's
 
03:34:43.990 --> 03:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
a clear mandate that all products be
 
03:34:45.750 --> 03:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
tested right i don't see that in the
 
03:34:45.760 --> 03:34:46.550 align:start position:0%
tested right i don't see that in the
bill

03:34:46.550 --> 03:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:34:48.630 --> 03:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
there's really a lot left to imagination
 
03:34:50.469 --> 03:34:50.479 align:start position:0%
and the liquor commission will surely do
 
03:34:51.910 --> 03:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
it this way but
 
03:34:53.830 --> 03:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
i don't see a lot of requirements that
 
03:34:56.950 --> 03:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
are usually in bills like this
 
03:35:01.670 --> 03:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:03.670 --> 03:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think the liquor commission
 
03:35:05.830 --> 03:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
understands these things very well yet
 
03:35:08.389 --> 03:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
is it in the cost i believe that if i
 
03:35:10.309 --> 03:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
may mr chairman the liquor commission
 
03:35:12.870 --> 03:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
talked specifically in here today to
 
03:35:12.880 --> 03:35:14.309 align:start position:0%
talked specifically in here today to
testing

03:35:14.309 --> 03:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
testing
 
03:35:16.150 --> 03:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
so mr chairman i think that they are
 
03:35:18.150 --> 03:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
aware this needs to be done
 
03:35:20.309 --> 03:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i can close this argument again if
 
03:35:21.910 --> 03:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
you look under
 
03:35:24.150 --> 03:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
on page five where it talks about the
 
03:35:26.229 --> 03:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
regulation of cannabis it starts and if
 
03:35:27.990 --> 03:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
you go to number
 
03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:28.790 align:start position:0%
you go to number
ten

03:35:28.790 --> 03:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
ten
 
03:35:30.630 --> 03:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
require that part of the rule making
 
03:35:32.229 --> 03:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
things they have to do the requirements
 
03:35:34.550 --> 03:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
for the testing of cannabis so it's a
 
03:35:36.950 --> 03:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
mandate for numbers it's on page six so
 
03:35:39.750 --> 03:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
it follows on to page six on line 12. so
 
03:35:42.309 --> 03:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
again as part of the regulatory
 
03:35:44.229 --> 03:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
requirements and and the rulemaking
 
03:35:46.070 --> 03:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
requirements of
 
03:35:48.550 --> 03:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
the agency they have to
 
03:35:50.389 --> 03:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
create rules for the requirements for
 
03:35:52.389 --> 03:35:52.399 align:start position:0%
the testing of cannabis right
 
03:35:54.469 --> 03:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for that and i may clarify
 
03:35:56.630 --> 03:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
it does not require that all cannabis be
 
03:35:58.870 --> 03:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
independently lab tested it authorizes
 
03:36:00.790 --> 03:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission to make rules that
 
03:36:03.269 --> 03:36:03.279 align:start position:0%
may require it i'll agree with that a
 
03:36:04.790 --> 03:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
big difference
 
03:36:07.670 --> 03:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
you'll fix that again if we want to if
 
03:36:09.269 --> 03:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
that's the will of the committee is to
 
03:36:10.389 --> 03:36:10.399 align:start position:0%
say that
 
03:36:12.309 --> 03:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
in in instead of putting it in rule
 
03:36:13.510 --> 03:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
making and telling them they have to
 
03:36:15.990 --> 03:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
create it i can put in there that says
 
03:36:18.389 --> 03:36:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh create rules that says test that that
 
03:36:19.910 --> 03:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
testing will be done of all cannabis and
 
03:36:21.349 --> 03:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
then they'll create the rules around
 
03:36:21.359 --> 03:36:23.510 align:start position:0%
then they'll create the rules around
that

03:36:23.510 --> 03:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:36:24.630 --> 03:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
03:36:27.670 --> 03:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
like independently laboratory testing
 
03:36:29.750 --> 03:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
well there's a testing there's a testing
 
03:36:32.389 --> 03:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
license in here so the facility has to
 
03:36:33.750 --> 03:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
light if they want wanted if they want
 
03:36:36.150 --> 03:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
to be a certified testing facility they
 
03:36:37.670 --> 03:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
have to get a license so what i can do
 
03:36:39.750 --> 03:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
is under that number 10
 
03:36:41.830 --> 03:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
just change that to say that they'll
 
03:36:43.830 --> 03:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
make rules or regulations requiring the
 
03:36:45.750 --> 03:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
testing of all cannabis
 
03:36:47.269 --> 03:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
if that meets the requirements of the
 
03:36:47.279 --> 03:36:50.070 align:start position:0%
if that meets the requirements of the
committee

03:36:50.070 --> 03:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:53.269 --> 03:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
representative romney yeah i'm at um
 
03:36:55.269 --> 03:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
when you mention vermont tiers so that
 
03:36:57.190 --> 03:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
they have seven tiers but they also have
 
03:36:59.030 --> 03:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh is their licenses tiered that way in
 
03:37:00.309 --> 03:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
03:37:03.590 --> 03:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
small farmer less fee per year to have a
 
03:37:05.750 --> 03:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
license is that it it's your knowledge
 
03:37:07.750 --> 03:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah six six cultivation
 
03:37:07.760 --> 03:37:08.710 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah six six cultivation
tiers

03:37:08.710 --> 03:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
tiers
 
03:37:11.030 --> 03:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
and uh the license fees vary
 
03:37:13.750 --> 03:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
dramatically from the tiers uh
 
03:37:17.190 --> 03:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
furthermore each licensee in vermont can
 
03:37:19.349 --> 03:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
get each type of license but you can
 
03:37:21.269 --> 03:37:21.279 align:start position:0%
only get one so you can become
 
03:37:23.190 --> 03:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
vertically integrated if you apply for a
 
03:37:24.950 --> 03:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
cultivator license a manufacturer
 
03:37:27.429 --> 03:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
license and a retail license but they
 
03:37:29.110 --> 03:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
limited all of those license types so
 
03:37:31.190 --> 03:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
that nobody can get one more than one to
 
03:37:34.070 --> 03:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
limit corporate consolidation etc
 
03:37:38.309 --> 03:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:40.710 --> 03:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
just one more question about vermont
 
03:37:41.670 --> 03:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
we're gonna
 
03:37:46.309 --> 03:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
shut this place down by quarter off
 
03:37:46.319 --> 03:37:48.469 align:start position:0%
shut this place down by quarter off
yeah

03:37:48.469 --> 03:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:37:50.870 --> 03:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
so go ahead yeah i don't think vermont
 
03:37:53.349 --> 03:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
has started yet they're still approving
 
03:37:53.359 --> 03:37:55.190 align:start position:0%
has started yet they're still approving
it

03:37:55.190 --> 03:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
yes they finalize the rules they've just
 
03:37:59.110 --> 03:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
opened the initial application period
 
03:38:01.269 --> 03:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
but they have approved and finalized all
 
03:38:02.790 --> 03:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
the rules the legislature just signed
 
03:38:04.950 --> 03:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
off on them last week i believe so most
 
03:38:08.150 --> 03:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:11.110 --> 03:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:38:13.429 --> 03:38:13.439 align:start position:0%

03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
