of this legislation and I'm here to
 
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
offer a friendly amendment to your
 
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
committee for consideration which
 
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.950 align:start position:0%
committee for consideration which
doesn't

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.670 align:start position:0%
doesn't
um

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 align:start position:0%
change anything about the number of
 
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
bingo dates but simply allows an
 
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
employee of a bona fide charitable
 
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
organization to claim fifty dollars of
 
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
expenses rather than the current
 
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
sorry did we do we have that friendly
 
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
okay so it looks like it was uh Senator
 
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
Susie's name is on it yes is that okay
 
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and so it's Amendment over in
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
Commerce okay now so
 
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
the moving finger of fate fell on me
 
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
we're lucky to have you uh so it looks
 
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
like it's an amendment 1403 s does
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
everyone see that
 
00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:36.139 align:start position:0%
so it just basically changes it from 25
 
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
per day
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
to 50.
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee are you
 
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative Susan all me
 
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
and I've been I was wondering before
 
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
this how would you they get the
 
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.529 align:start position:0%
this how would you they get the
charities

00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
charities
 
00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
that could staff three to four days a
 
00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:02.330 align:start position:0%
that could staff three to four days a
week

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
on if they increased the number of of
 
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
days but
 
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
maybe this solves that I think this
 
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
would help solve that I mean it may not
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
be the same staff member
 
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
who staffed
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
an additional number of dates but if
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
people are to the extent that people are
 
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
not covering their expenses
 
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
to staff the Bingo dates
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
this would help
 
00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
them be able to do that and it doesn't
 
00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:46.189 align:start position:0%
them be able to do that and it doesn't
require

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars it just raises the ceiling
 
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
I see a so representative Jordan ulery
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
um two questions the first question is
 
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
on your Amendment uh can you tell me
 
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.390 align:start position:0%
on your Amendment uh can you tell me
what

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:13.259 align:start position:0%
generated the
 
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:17.300 align:start position:0%
impetus or what was the impetus for this
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
probably someone behind me can do a
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
better job
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
their answer used it myself
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
and the second second question follow-up
 
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
I'm the follow-up question on that is on
 
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
the on the primary Bill uh since the
 
00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:35.339 align:start position:0%
year of the number two sponsor on this
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
on the primary Bill if you increase the
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
number of days
 
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
is the information you had and was it
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
discussed in the Senate whether or not
 
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
increasing the number of days would
 
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
dilute the pool of players by having
 
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:53.220 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better phraseology too
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
many games available
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
the lack of players
 
00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
that there was no testimony in the
 
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
Senate that that would be an issue
 
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Matt oh thank you senator
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
representative Susan Allman did you have
 
00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:10.820 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you yes I've been trying to find
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
my copy of the amendment which I'd put
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
with 192. so on what kinds of expenses
 
00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:26.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:27.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
I don't believe there's a statutory
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
explanation of it I know what kind of
 
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
expenses I might try to claim if I were
 
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
working for one of these entities it
 
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
might be gas needed to go from where I
 
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:49.740 align:start position:0%
live to where the bingo hall is it might
 
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
be food if I needed to pick up dinner on
 
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
the way might be um
 
00:09:59.269 --> 00:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
to pay for a babysitter if I had to
 
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:06.779 align:start position:0%
and just as I mentioned I have been
 
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519 align:start position:0%
involved in this field a little bit and
 
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
it is this is a very helpful Bill and as
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
amended it's also very helpful because
 
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
it is hard to get these are mostly
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
volunteers for a charity and it's hard
 
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
to get them to come up and they do have
 
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
legitimate expenses of Transportation a
 
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
meal while they're sitting there those
 
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:26.220 align:start position:0%
kinds of things are normally appropriate
 
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
and 25 doesn't go as long or as far as
 
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
it used to so other questions from the
 
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question you
 
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:41.700 align:start position:0%
said this is a friendly Amendment and
 
00:10:44.329 --> 00:10:44.339 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor is is aware and
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
supports he is not because he's in
 
00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
Florida but I consider it a friendly
 
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
amendment I have not heard that there's
 
00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
any opposition to it so we offer it as a
 
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
friendly Amendment he is on vacation and
 
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:23.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of
 
00:11:26.449 --> 00:11:26.459 align:start position:0%
community my name is Mike McLaughlin
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
malarian lobbyists and conquerative
 
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
represent Community Bingo and are here
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
to testify in support of Senate bill 19.
 
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
um Senate Bill 19 will give the
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
Charities who play Bingo and sell Lucky
 
00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
7 tickets an opportunity to get extra
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
dates uh if they become available again
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's not a mandatory uh requirement that
 
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
you do 16 dates uh more uh I'm more
 
00:11:50.329 --> 00:11:50.339 align:start position:0%
interested in the uh the amended version
 
00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:52.220 align:start position:0%
which allows
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
volunteers to receive the compensation
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
was more reflective what costs are today
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
I mean four dollar gallon gas and too
 
00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
low and I mean I've got grandchildren
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
they have to pay 50 a night for a
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
babysitter all these changes were looked
 
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
into by the lottery we had discussions
 
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
with the lottery and they offered no a
 
00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:12.779 align:start position:0%
contrary uh opinion against raising the
 
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
limit to fifty dollars again it's a
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
thing that it would help get people to
 
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
work and it's interesting to note in the
 
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
Bingo Lucky 7 world as opposed to the
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
the casino world where the Charities
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
have the operation which is completely
 
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
handled by Third parties so they have
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
don't have to recruit people to come
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
into work they really have a better
 
00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
opportunity because they've got
 
00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:38.339 align:start position:0%
professional people running their games
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
whereas the Bingo Lucky 7 world is
 
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
dependent on the charity recruiting
 
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
I see some hands up are you open to
 
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
taking questions did you have anything
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
else to say before we could go off okay
 
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.290 align:start position:0%
else to say before we could go off okay
representative

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:12:59.210 --> 00:12:59.220 align:start position:0%
um we talked about expenses that could
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed potentially
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
um let's say someone just lived down the
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
road and they walked there
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
um could they claim I think I should I I
 
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
should be paid fifty dollars for
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
compensation is that a legitimate
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
expense or does it have to be well when
 
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
I think you talk about an expense
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes there is gasoline or
 
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
babysitting but there's also if you walk
 
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
down there and you help set up the
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
chairs clean the hall uh make sure the
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
bathrooms are clean all those types of
 
00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
assistance uh things that you could say
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
to the charity and you and the amendment
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
says you submit your expenses in writing
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
it would be the charity we would say to
 
00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
you and those those are ridiculous we're
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
not going to pay for that but we are
 
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
going to pay you to take down 200 shares
 
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
or to wash the windows or something that
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
helps the game assist in the operation
 
00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
of the game so the charity may say no uh
 
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
there's no specifics in the statute
 
00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
today that says you know washing the
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
windows is no good but you know setting
 
00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:56.339 align:start position:0%
up the chairs is so it's the I think a
 
00:13:59.810 --> 00:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
charity uh it would be kind of looking
 
00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
at the expense and maybe not tonight but
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
you walked you know down the street
 
00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
thank you I saw something yes
 
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative Platt yes thank you for
 
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is more to do
 
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
with the increase in game days
 
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
will that make it harder for Charities
 
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
to find any games uh days because it's
 
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
crowded out for the longer days but
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
those who do get in
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
the um the availability of of commercial
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
Halls could be a concern
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
but again the um I don't have
 
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
information in front of me there was
 
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
testimony in several different points
 
00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:35.579 align:start position:0%
from Charities that we might get fruit
 
00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:38.820 align:start position:0%
frozen out but that's a consideration uh
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
if there are enough Charities who want
 
00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:42.779 align:start position:0%
to participate
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
um they could have a commercial
 
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
opportunity right now we have several
 
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
commercial Halls one of mansions that I
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
know that I represent uh there's one in
 
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
Hudson there's one in Nashua which is
 
00:14:55.009 --> 00:14:55.019 align:start position:0%
here today uh so the
 
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
the net result of the bill
 
00:14:59.930 --> 00:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
could have an impact on Charities but
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
right today it's written because there
 
00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
are dates hanging certain Halls that
 
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:08.220 align:start position:0%
aren't used so it is it would be unfair
 
00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
to say that yeah then there would be no
 
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
effect but I don't see today in our hall
 
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
for instance we had two Charities leave
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:22.139 align:start position:0%
other yes representatively
 
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
thank you my questions related so how
 
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
does how does it work when a new charity
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
approaches you and said and says we'd
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
like to have a date do they like get in
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
line behind the ones that are already
 
00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:35.870 align:start position:0%
line behind the ones that are already
um

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
familiar with you and work with you is
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
it your decision how does that work well
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
commercial Hall is basically is renting
 
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
the floor space to the charity five
 
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
dollars per person up like maximum of
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
ten uh they get foot traffic so the idea
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
of who's going to get it is a charity
 
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
that can perform the best because
 
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
commercial Hall does not share in the
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
proceeds of the game they don't share in
 
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
the Lucky Seven they don't share the
 
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
Bingo all they share in it is the foot
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
traffic so if the um uh XYZ charity
 
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
comes in and says we can guarantee two
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
or three hundred people a night uh we're
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
gonna prioritize them over the charity
 
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
Associates we're just getting started we
 
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
have no idea what we're doing how about
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
a date so it's a commercial decision of
 
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
who can provide the best result for the
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
charity and for the whole because the
 
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
Halls are commercial real estate they're
 
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
taxed their electricity
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
etc etc so they must make the decision
 
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
that's commercially reasonable uh with
 
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
relation to the Charities who apply uh
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
to Bessemer Lodge uh we've had waiting
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
lists and we do it chronologically if
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
there's five people on the waitlist uh
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
number one gets in next but a charity
 
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
that's just starting out having really
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
no experience is gonna have a hard time
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
convincing a hall that they can fill it
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
up at night
 
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.069 align:start position:0%
up at night
follow-up

00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
so it seems like a reasonable concern
 
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
that if we
 
00:16:59.930 --> 00:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
um increase from 10 to 16 days that
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
whoever runs the Halls would prioritize
 
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:05.900 align:start position:0%
giving more days to the most successful
 
00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:09.299 align:start position:0%
Charities if it's a Biz purely a
 
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
business decision well I think you're
 
00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:12.419 align:start position:0%
going to run to that decision no matter
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
what you do because we've got for
 
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
instance the casino style gambling has a
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of success and a
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of Charities looking
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
to get in everybody can't get in it's
 
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
going to be the same with a commercial
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
bingo hall that if you're going to have
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
an opportunity you're going to look for
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
the best best client so the only thing
 
00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:33.419 align:start position:0%
that solves those type of questions is
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
more commercial Halls because it's going
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
to be supply and demand it's a the
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
commercial Hall is a business Enterprise
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
they have only one thing to do with the
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
charity that's provide the floor space
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
they collect their five to ten dollars
 
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
per foot uh foot traffic and hopefully
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:54.419 align:start position:0%
can I have another one
 
00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
you follow thank you so um obviously
 
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
I've never played I need to get out more
 
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
um and you never would have if it's a
 
00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
question of having foot traffic you
 
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
would never have two charities
 
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
um come in at the same time because that
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
would be more maybe two smaller ones
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
that just doesn't work it's interesting
 
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
to say that but today a bingo date is
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
granted to one charity okay some Halls
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
are able to run two um dates per day at
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
maybe at 10 o'clock and four o'clock in
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
the afternoon or two o'clock and eight
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
o'clock at night so Elijah Hall can run
 
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
two nights and interesting enough years
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
ago there was a bill passed I know the
 
00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:36.299 align:start position:0%
guy who had it done it was me to join
 
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
Charities together in electronic Bingo
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
the licenses were there but really
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
nobody could find the software to make
 
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
it happen so putting two Charities
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
together in one Bingo good is not
 
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
allowed okay thank you so much thank you
 
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
all right I saw some hands over here yes
 
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
how many of the bingo halls are outside
 
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
of the big cities at this point
 
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
I can only uh test Friday three I know
 
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.850 align:start position:0%
I can only uh test Friday three I know
of

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
that they're in Nashua Hudson Manchester
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know of any out in the
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
Hinterlands only because of the uh
 
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
population issues
 
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
okay so follow up we're really thank you
 
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
we're really only talking about the big
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
places there were was in this one and I
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
think in another one I've been reading
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
the Senate notes and the the hearing
 
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
notes and the
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
um there was some worry
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
that everybody agreed that that a lot of
 
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
the people who go to the bingo hall are
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
not just there to socialize with each
 
00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:48.419 align:start position:0%
other at this point with their friends
 
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
but are chasing the biggest jackpot and
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
the biggest jackpot occurs when the
 
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
smaller jackpots
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
build up as I understand One credit card
 
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
carry forward or whatever it's called
 
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
not that's from a different language but
 
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.409 align:start position:0%
not that's from a different language but
uh

00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:09.419 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:09.419 --> 00:20:10.310 align:start position:0%
uh
um

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
and that so that if you had 16 days your
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
charity would have more chance of
 
00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
building up a really big jackpot and get
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
more people from the other charities in
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
the same city
 
00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:31.220 align:start position:0%
that were um we're only at 10 or less
 
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
there was one person apparently they
 
00:20:39.169 --> 00:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
only had one day but on
 
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
this this seems to have been moral worry
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
in the other bill
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
that we were looking at
 
00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:48.299 align:start position:0%
but that we will be looking at but
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
on do you have
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
any comment on I think you were
 
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.930 align:start position:0%
any comment on I think you were
actually

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.450 align:start position:0%
actually
listed

00:20:59.450 --> 00:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
listed
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
as saying something about yeah that can
 
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
be a problem
 
00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
I don't understand exactly what you want
 
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:11.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
which is a progressive Jackpot Bingo
 
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
game and that game can create jackpots
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
to 10 20 30 40 000 but what we're
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
talking about bingo today bingo today is
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
not the
 
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
really funded a hundreds of supported by
 
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
members of the chart it's a social uh
 
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
event but it's on the internet each
 
00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
commercial level system our commercial
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
has a Facebook page the Facebook page
 
00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:39.539 align:start position:0%
covers the people who are the Charities
 
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
were playing publicizes their jackpots
 
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
so when you talk about the Bingo play
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
today that player is looking in the
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
social uh media looking for the best
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
place to play so as the jackpots grow
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
yes the uh the uh foot traffic increases
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
and more Bingo dates will in if you have
 
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
a progressive jackpot will add you know
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
exponentially as your jackpot grows more
 
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
people show up so yeah a charity who is
 
00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
uh running 16 dates and running a
 
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
carryover coverall and selling Lucky
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
Sevens is going to have a successful
 
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.510 align:start position:0%
Sevens is going to have a successful
charity

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
charity
 
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.890 align:start position:0%
charity
fall

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
fall
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
I I think this is from the notes on the
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
other bill but someone pointed out that
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
if the jackpot is won then that Hall
 
00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
for a while after that is going to have
 
00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:36.059 align:start position:0%
less jackpots than anybody else and so
 
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
it in the end it might work out
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
well in our home we have more than one
 
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
charity so if a large jackpot is hit
 
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
with Charity X charity y may have a
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
similar or a little bit of lesser of a
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
jackpot on Tuesday night than charity a
 
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
had on Wednesday night so it's it's a um
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's a constant uh flow of uh Lucky
 
00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
Seven jackpots carryover coverall
 
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
jackpots there's um you know a large
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
jackpot attracts people to come into
 
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.390 align:start position:0%
jackpot attracts people to come into
play

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
play
 
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
I see other hands representative
 
00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:09.419 align:start position:0%
Schomburg thank you madam chair and
 
00:23:12.529 --> 00:23:12.539 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh who
 
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
audits the expenditures are submitted by
 
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
The Bona Fide members of a charitable
 
00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.049 align:start position:0%
The Bona Fide members of a charitable
organization

00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:18.059 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:23:18.059 --> 00:23:19.310 align:start position:0%
organization
well

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
um if a child organization hires a bingo
 
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
consultant somebody to help them out
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
they usually help them do the paperwork
 
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
so the paperwork is then audited put
 
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
together and sent to the lottery and the
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
lottery that has the opportunity to come
 
00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:36.299 align:start position:0%
down and inspect the books and do the
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
audits so it's a kind of a it's either a
 
00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
charitable member or does the books or
 
00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
they hire a bingo consultant to help
 
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
them with the professional preparation
 
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
then to the lottery then the lottery can
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
say okay let's go down and visit Hall X
 
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
or charity y we look at the books if the
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
books are clean they off they go and if
 
00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
the books are bad the chair the the
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
lottery steps in and
 
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
um either gets corrective action or
 
00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:06.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
who pays for the itemized expenditures
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
is it the charitable organization or is
 
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
it the hall
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
the hall has nothing to do with the
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
Charities only the five dollars to seven
 
00:24:20.649 --> 00:24:20.659 align:start position:0%
to ten dollars they collect per person
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
the Charities are just like renting a
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
grocery store the the landlord has a
 
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
billing the grocery store has these
 
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:34.700 align:start position:0%
so it is the
 
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
charity that pays the individual correct
 
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
oops other hands on that side of the
 
00:24:45.529 --> 00:24:45.539 align:start position:0%
room representative fellows
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
yes I live in the hinderlands
 
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
so I don't I'm not familiar with these
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
setups it says from what I can gather by
 
00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill in the fiscal note
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's the chi the charity
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
pays a 25 fee to the state for each game
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
no the charity does not pay to the state
 
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
collects taxes on the proceeds of Bingo
 
00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:15.539 align:start position:0%
and lucky 760 25 or the now that would
 
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
be fifty dollars is paid by the charity
 
00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:21.179 --> 00:25:24.890 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
you talked about the licensing yeah I'm
 
00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059 align:start position:0%
looking at the the methodology on the
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and it says that there are
 
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
52 charitable organizations licensed to
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
offer Bingo no I was I was responding to
 
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:45.289 --> 00:25:45.299 align:start position:0%
so yeah they would pay an additional a
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
bingo date they would pay if they had
 
00:25:48.049 --> 00:25:48.059 align:start position:0%
additional dates they would put
 
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
additional licenses fees
 
00:25:54.649 --> 00:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.169 --> 00:25:57.179 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
00:25:59.810 --> 00:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
are there any other fees involved with
 
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
this because I I understand the
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
operation that you run and Charities
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
kind of like you know give you a cut to
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
cover using the Halls that you have but
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
what about other Charities can charities
 
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
use the you know
 
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
Foreign Legion Hall or some other just
 
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
general location and they and they get
 
00:26:30.769 --> 00:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
the the helper person consultant to
 
00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:33.299 align:start position:0%
cover that well I'm just trying to
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
understand if we're talking about just
 
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
something that's in a very select area
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
or could be happening all over the state
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
a small charity or any charity can get
 
00:26:45.649 --> 00:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
licensed and they can hold their game in
 
00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
a location that's approved by the
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
lottery so if you have a hall in your
 
00:26:51.769 --> 00:26:51.779 align:start position:0%
Hinterland and x and the charity wants
 
00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
to run a bingo game they can apply for
 
00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
their license uh set up their operation
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
in in that Hall then they don't have to
 
00:27:00.649 --> 00:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
collect the the uh pay the fee as a
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
basically a rent for the hall they can
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
run their own game what's happened in
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
the last 20 years is the uh somebody saw
 
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to put together multiple
 
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039 align:start position:0%
charities in a single location and
 
00:27:15.409 --> 00:27:15.419 align:start position:0%
therefore increasing the foot traffic
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
and the pro proceeds so if you are
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
sitting in the Hinterlands you can run
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
your own game
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay on this side of the room any
 
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.190 align:start position:0%
okay on this side of the room any
questions

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
on this side are there more questions
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative Susan Ami well just a
 
00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
clarification on we have Penny Bingo we
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
have one penny Bingo uh in the senior
 
00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:41.630 align:start position:0%
have one penny Bingo uh in the senior
centers

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
centers
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
I presume they aren't paying the state
 
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.490 align:start position:0%
I presume they aren't paying the state
anything

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559 align:start position:0%
well if there's a penny a card
 
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
Bingo collects I think uh seven percent
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
tax on all type of bingo games so if
 
00:27:58.370 --> 00:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
you've got a Penny Bingo uh and the
 
00:27:59.930 --> 00:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
price is 10 cents they're gonna get
 
00:28:03.289 --> 00:28:03.299 align:start position:0%
0.007 or what I mean I don't know if
 
00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:04.919 align:start position:0%
they're uh I can't really justify to
 
00:28:04.919 --> 00:28:06.049 align:start position:0%
they're uh I can't really justify to
that

00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:06.059 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
yeah this individual is representing his
 
00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
commercial bingo hall so he can't just
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
comment on all but I I believe they
 
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
don't pay yeah but we probably don't pay
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay we will now
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
recognize Rick Newman who represents
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.049 --> 00:28:33.059 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
my name is Rick Newman and I am here
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
today representing Spartans Drummond
 
00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
bugle uh core out of uh Nashua we
 
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
support uh Senate Bill 19. uh I just
 
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
want to focus on the the primary bill
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
for for a moment
 
00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
so not every commercial bingo hall is
 
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
the same right there are some that have
 
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
plenty of Charities and they can operate
 
00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:00.299 align:start position:0%
every day seven days a week
 
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
and there's no problem
 
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
but in some cases as we've seen over the
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
years there used to be about 18
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
commercial bingo halls I just tried to
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
look up and try to answer the question
 
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
asked about where they're located I
 
00:29:15.529 --> 00:29:15.539 align:start position:0%
couldn't find it on the website but I
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
believe we're down to about six now in
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
um and not all of them
 
00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
well many of them want to run seven days
 
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
a week but they can't necessarily do it
 
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
because they don't have
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
enough Charities even you only need four
 
00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:33.539 align:start position:0%
but Bingo is a very difficult game to
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
run because Bingo requires all it to be
 
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
run by charity volunteers so you have to
 
00:29:42.409 --> 00:29:42.419 align:start position:0%
get people who are willing to come in
 
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
and spend several hours every day to set
 
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
up and and run the bingo game and that's
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
why we're looking to change this from 10
 
00:29:54.769 --> 00:29:54.779 align:start position:0%
days maximum to 16 so that if there is a
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
bingo hall that can't fill seven days a
 
00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
week because they don't have four
 
00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
Charities that want to do it but they
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
might have two that are willing to do
 
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
the 16 or 15 days then that Hall can be
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
open seven days a week and those
 
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
Charities can benefit that's the that is
 
00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
really what this bill is about it may
 
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:19.340 align:start position:0%
very well be that
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh some Halls will never take advantage
 
00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
of it that makes perfect sense if
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
they've got five or six uh Charities to
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
be able to be open seven days a week but
 
00:30:30.769 --> 00:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
for those who can't for those who have
 
00:30:30.779 --> 00:30:32.269 align:start position:0%
for those who can't for those who have
difficulty

00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
difficulty
 
00:30:33.889 --> 00:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
um this bill will help them and that
 
00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
that's the reason that we ask that it be
 
00:30:36.179 --> 00:30:40.070 align:start position:0%
that's the reason that we ask that it be
introduced

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
uh are you open to questions yes
 
00:30:45.289 --> 00:30:45.299 align:start position:0%
representative Susan almie
 
00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:48.299 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
00:30:48.299 --> 00:30:50.049 align:start position:0%
thank you so
those

00:30:50.049 --> 00:30:50.059 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
on six Halls are all in three cities
 
00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
correct but well I know that people are
 
00:31:00.409 --> 00:31:00.419 align:start position:0%
having trouble I know there's one in
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
Dover there's one in Nashua there's one
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
in Manchester
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
there's one in Hudson
 
00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
off top my head those are the places I'm
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
trying others well there is a hall here
 
00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
in Concord but not sure if their quality
 
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
if they classified as commercial because
 
00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:18.740 align:start position:0%
they only run their own bingo
 
00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.389 align:start position:0%
they only run their own bingo
the

00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:21.919 align:start position:0%
what is it
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
Temple yes back touch Temple they run a
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
bingo game at their own Hall but I don't
 
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
believe that that's a commercial Hall
 
00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:29.930 align:start position:0%
believe that that's a commercial Hall
um

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
as I said there used to be commercial
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
Halls really throughout the state
 
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Somersworth had them
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
Newington I can remember
 
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
have them these Halls have disappeared
 
00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:48.529 --> 00:31:48.539 align:start position:0%
all the questions from the committee
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your testimony
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
okay the chair recognizes Paul LaFlamme
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
I think it's drum and bugle Corps as
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
well yes I'm actually the executive
 
00:32:03.169 --> 00:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
director of the Spartans uh Drummond
 
00:32:06.649 --> 00:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
bugle Corps Senator avard submitted this
 
00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
bill at my request and so you can blame
 
00:32:12.769 --> 00:32:12.779 align:start position:0%
me as to why you just spent an hour or
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
half hour talking about bingo uh so yes
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
my name is Paula flam I'm the executive
 
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
director of the Spartans we have been in
 
00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:22.919 align:start position:0%
business since 1955 when my grandfather
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
founded the organization we are based
 
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
down in Nashua but we take great pride
 
00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:31.740 align:start position:0%
over the course of our summer tour every
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
summer 8 000 miles we don't just
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
represent Nashua we represent the
 
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
entirety of the State of New Hampshire
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
as we perform and compete throughout the
 
00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.970 align:start position:0%
as we perform and compete throughout the
country

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:32:45.409 --> 00:32:45.419 align:start position:0%
since 1955 Bingo has been a huge part of
 
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
what we do it has allowed us to sustain
 
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
ourselves and continue on um to get to
 
00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:51.710 align:start position:0%
ourselves and continue on um to get to
today

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:32:54.529 --> 00:32:54.539 align:start position:0%
there's only three of us left in an
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
activity that used to have three drum
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
cores in every single community
 
00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:00.980 align:start position:0%
Bingo allows us to have a steady
 
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
consistent Revenue stream to keep our
 
00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:06.380 align:start position:0%
lights on all year
 
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.970 align:start position:0%
lights on all year
and

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:07.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.110 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
over the course of the last five six
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
seven years with the expansion of the
 
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
casinos and The Kino and the HHR
 
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
machines and all and sports betting
 
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
our revenues have been slightly going
 
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.140 align:start position:0%
down let's face it there's only so many
 
00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:27.059 align:start position:0%
gambling dollars available to the
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
consumer so by expanding our base of
 
00:33:33.889 --> 00:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
operations here and able to do three
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
weeks instead of or three days instead
 
00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:39.740 align:start position:0%
of two days a week would really help us
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
minimize those losses
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try not to repeat anything
 
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
that has already been said but there are
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
just a couple of things that I I just
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
would like to touch on that were
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
questions the question about jackpots uh
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
representative olami yes jackpots will
 
00:33:57.769 --> 00:33:57.779 align:start position:0%
if somebody were to take on three days
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
of bingo per week yes jackpots would go
 
00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
up but guess what it's the exact same
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
odds so they're going to come down just
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
as quickly you're actually dollar cost
 
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
averaging over time probably a little
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
bit better
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
um how to staff
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
that was a big question here how are we
 
00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
going to staff three nights of bingo
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
well some Charities might not be able to
 
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
and that's okay the word shall does not
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
appear anywhere in Senate bill 19.
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
Charities may have three nights of bingo
 
00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:27.419 align:start position:0%
if they think they can staff it but if
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
they can't they don't have to that's
 
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
aren't us that's that's the decision of
 
00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
the Charities to make that decision
 
00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:37.210 align:start position:0%
the Charities to make that decision
um

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:37.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
representative leapley you asked uh the
 
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
the process of of getting new Charities
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
into place it's a good question
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
20 years ago it was probably even a
 
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
better question because there probably
 
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
was waiting lists of Charities trying to
 
00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:54.419 align:start position:0%
get into these bingo halls however with
 
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
the especially with the expansion of the
 
00:34:58.970 --> 00:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
casino gaming or charitable gaming
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of Charities have left bingo and
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
they realized how easy it is to sign up
 
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
with a casino
 
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
fill out the paperwork wait a couple of
 
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
weeks and get a check Bingo's a lot of
 
00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
work I can testify under oath to that so
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of Charities are like we're gonna
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
do that instead which leaves a lot of
 
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
openings it was already said during the
 
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
house uh hearing or the Senate hearing
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
rather I talked about one of my
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
competitors the Hudson Hall had two
 
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
nights open
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
that they they contacted me three
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
different times and said hey how about
 
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
coming over to Hudson we're so much
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
better than Nashville come on come on
 
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
come on come on
 
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
I chose not to do that
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
but guess what's happened
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
two Charities have left another Hall in
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to go over to Hudson
 
00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
leaving that Hall that they left in in
 
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
trouble so the idea that there was all
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
these Charities lined up it's just it's
 
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
just a fallacy it's not true it's just
 
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.010 align:start position:0%
just a fallacy it's not true it's just
not

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:59.930 align:start position:0%
not
um

00:35:59.930 --> 00:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
I think that was all the questions but I
 
00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
would love to have questions from the
 
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:07.849 align:start position:0%
would love to have questions from the
committee

00:36:07.849 --> 00:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative lippley thank you I
 
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
remember reading
 
00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:13.849 align:start position:0%
remember reading
um

00:36:13.849 --> 00:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
hearing notes that this is a popular
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
social activity for seniors
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
um can you talk about
 
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:28.140 align:start position:0%
um that and if it's something that folks
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
enjoy and it's only available once in a
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
while and and the availability is going
 
00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:35.900 align:start position:0%
to go down can you comment on that
 
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
availability go down if this bill passes
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
now if the Halls aren't doing as well
 
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
and oh I see what you're saying yes or
 
00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
can't be open as many nights a week sure
 
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
um it's absolutely a social activity
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
um and I think I can probably I can
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
speak directly for the national Hall but
 
00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make a leap of faith and
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
say it's probably true for all of them
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of regulars like they come
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
in on their regular scheduled night I
 
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
play Bingo every Monday and Thursday or
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
whatever the case might be we open up
 
00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:10.740 align:start position:0%
the doors at three o'clock there's
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
people standing there waiting to get in
 
00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:14.339 align:start position:0%
Bingo doesn't start until seven o'clock
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
so they go to the kitchen they get a
 
00:37:19.849 --> 00:37:19.859 align:start position:0%
snack they sit down they talk they get
 
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
to be friendly with all the volunteers
 
00:37:23.569 --> 00:37:23.579 align:start position:0%
and they know each other by name and
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
they tell stories it becomes a whole
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
social event for the entirety of the
 
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.050 align:start position:0%
social event for the entirety of the
afternoon

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:29.060 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
and a lot of these people not all of
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
them there is a there is a what I call
 
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
uh the soccer mom
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
um demographic that's starting to come
 
00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
to Bingo but there's still the very
 
00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:42.839 align:start position:0%
traditional older person who's sitting
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
in their home all by themselves and this
 
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
is their one one opportunity to come out
 
00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
and and visit
 
00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
so I think we do feel a very important
 
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.089 --> 00:37:59.099 align:start position:0%
representative horse thank you madam
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
so just a little while ago you said a
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
couple Charities went to Hudson where
 
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
well I don't want to talk out of turn uh
 
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
I think there's probably people behind

supplier manufacturer of uh
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
Lucky 7 dispensing devices and I want to
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
start off by saying yes this bill passed
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
the Senate with allowing a ten dollar
 
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.030 align:start position:0%
the Senate with allowing a ten dollar
ticket

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
ticket
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
we are here to ask you to modify that to
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
make it a two dollar ticket not a ten
 
00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
dollar ticket currently the maximum
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
ticket price is one dollar
 
00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
after you know really looking at this if
 
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
you think about some of the changes
 
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:28.740 align:start position:0%
you've made to Lucky Sevens in the last
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
several years one of the most important
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
being that you increase the deal size to
 
00:41:33.599 --> 00:41:34.910 align:start position:0%
being that you increase the deal size to
14

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
14
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
000 tickets
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
having a 10 ticket would allow a deal
 
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
that would could be would would be could
 
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
be as high as 140 000
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
um we think there may be some unintended
 
00:41:46.609 --> 00:41:46.619 align:start position:0%
consequences of something like that
 
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
having rethought this and but we do
 
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
think that the increase to two dollars
 
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
would be very beneficial let me just uh
 
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
explain here that uh I know you see a
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
lot of gambling and then a lot of you
 
00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
may be new to it so lucky seven tickets
 
00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:06.980 align:start position:0%
are primarily sold
 
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
in service clubs veterans Halls those
 
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
kinds of things vfw's Legions
 
00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:13.790 align:start position:0%
kinds of things vfw's Legions
um

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
and uh and and the like I mean they also
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
they're also sold at bingo games Okay
 
00:42:23.089 --> 00:42:23.099 align:start position:0%
um they are not generally sold at the
 
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
casinos the games of chance facilities
 
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
that I also happen to represent there
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
are to my knowledge there are two out of
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
the 15 casinos that still sell some
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
Lucky Seven tickets
 
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
uh but so so this isn't really affecting
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
the casinos in any way it really is
 
00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
giving the opportunity for a legion of
 
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
VFW the Eagles Club
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
um it's primarily affecting them
 
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
allowing them to sell a ticket uh go
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
from one dollar to two dollars I think
 
00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
it will be beneficial to them and we
 
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
would ask you to support the bill
 
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
and do we have such an amendment or is
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
that something you'd like us I'm
 
00:43:07.609 --> 00:43:07.619 align:start position:0%
suggesting it to the committee I would
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
be happy to I mean it really is a simple
 
00:43:11.329 --> 00:43:11.339 align:start position:0%
change of Crossing out 10 and putting in
 
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
two okay
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
are you open to questions sure
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
just just to make sure that I've got
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.089 --> 00:43:29.099 align:start position:0%
you or uh people you've worked with were
 
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
the prime movers for the ten dollars
 
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
then you rethought it and now it's two
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
dollars and there's no is there are
 
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
there any we may hear from them I
 
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
suppose any uh any that are pushing for
 
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
ten dollars not to my knowledge
 
00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.250 align:start position:0%
ten dollars not to my knowledge
representative

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh we'll find out I guess I guess we'll
 
00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:54.300 align:start position:0%
find out yeah but right now as far as
 
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
um you were pushing for 10 and now
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
you're pushing for two and
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's what we've got that's what you
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
want that's correct yeah
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
all right other hands over here super uh
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative Susan on me
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
thank you but I think
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
the clerk was ahead of me but sorry
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
about that uh representative Platt
 
00:44:17.809 --> 00:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
all right uh thank you for taking my
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
question what's the concern about the 10
 
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
bucks what would what what what what's
 
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
keeping you from going there well one of
 
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
the things we if you look at it one of
 
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
the changes that you folks made
 
00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
um I think it was last year
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
was to allow Lucky Seven tickets to be
 
00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
sold at games of chance facilities at
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
the so-called casinos right
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
so as I said there are 15 of them right
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
now only two do take part in it but if
 
00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:46.140 align:start position:0%
you were to combine the law you passed
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
last year with a law allowing a ten
 
00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:50.180 align:start position:0%
dollar ticket
 
00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:52.740 align:start position:0%
you may find that may encourage somebody
 
00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:55.740 align:start position:0%
somebody could open up theoretically a
 
00:44:59.089 --> 00:44:59.099 align:start position:0%
games of chance facility uh and put in
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
100 Lucky Seven machines there's no
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
regulations on that subject matter right
 
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
now and I think I don't think that's
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
anything anybody intended for that to
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
happen and that's not what we're looking
 
00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
to have happen
 
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
so that would be one of the things that
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
caused us concern to say we should put
 
00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
the brakes on this and think about it
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
but we certainly would like to help the
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
okay back to representative Army Susan
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
Army yeah thank you
 
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.970 align:start position:0%
Army yeah thank you
on

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
oh dear now I've
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
so what I thought you were saying before
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
was that um
 
00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:41.220 align:start position:0%
how many tickets did we say could be in
 
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
a deal now fourteen thousand fourteen
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
thousand so that would be uh if somebody
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
got that ten dollar ticket early on
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
they'd have to pay out a hundred and
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
forty thousand dollars
 
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
well no their potential would be 140 000
 
00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
in the pot let's assume 10 is set aside
 
00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
you get 90 percent of that so you'd have
 
00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
somewhere neighborhood of 100 to 26 000
 
00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
in prizes yeah there but you could be
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
offering very large prices
 
00:46:14.089 --> 00:46:14.099 align:start position:0%
in that kind of a game
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we learned about this
 
00:46:20.329 --> 00:46:20.339 align:start position:0%
earlier but that most of the people here
 
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:22.140 align:start position:0%
weren't here at that point
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
so the the problem with Lucky Seven
 
00:46:28.609 --> 00:46:28.619 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure how I can't remember
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
how it works for the machines that on if
 
00:46:35.329 --> 00:46:35.339 align:start position:0%
you have a box everybody knows that
 
00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
somebody won that top ticket
 
00:46:40.849 --> 00:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
and if the top top ticket was won after
 
00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
you've been through a third of the Box
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of the box is useless
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
so that happened also with the machines
 
00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.859 --> 00:46:51.410 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
no well I can't say no but it's
 
00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
certainly less likely because you we
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
also allow the combining of up to three
 
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
deals at a time so with electronic games
 
00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:07.140 align:start position:0%
they're pulling from different deals in
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
other words I guess the answer to your
 
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:10.380 align:start position:0%
question is a player is always going to
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to win an electronic
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
game it is possible you could have a
 
00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:17.579 align:start position:0%
dead box with a paper ticket which is
 
00:47:19.849 --> 00:47:19.859 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that in the Senate we
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
added the language that the ticket above
 
00:47:23.569 --> 00:47:23.579 align:start position:0%
a dollar
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
would be in the electronic game only
 
00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
so could I have it if nobody
 
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
said it helps the veterans halls and the
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
Brotherhood lodges the reason
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
um the reason Lucky Seven came into
 
00:47:50.329 --> 00:47:50.339 align:start position:0%
existence was to help the bingo halls
 
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:52.740 align:start position:0%
so actually the history of Lucky Seven
 
00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
tickets goes back before
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
there was a time and I happened to have
 
00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
been in the house when it happened uh
 
00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
when I was on a DNA back in the I think
 
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
it was the 80s and Lucky Seven tickets a
 
00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
bill was put in to allow the sale at
 
00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
bingo halls prior to that they could not
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
sell them at bingo halls they were only
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
sold in American Legions of vfw's eagles
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
clubs that sort of thing and uh and I
 
00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
don't mean to be leaving any groups out
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
until just the ones that come to the top
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
of my head but then that law was changed
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
and I want to say it was the 80s to
 
00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
allow Lucky Sevens at bingo halls
 
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
representative ORS
 
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question I guess I'm still
 
00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:40.140 align:start position:0%
confused to ask what is the concern with
 
00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
a 10 ticket is it is it concern that the
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
payout could be more than the receipts
 
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.190 align:start position:0%
payout could be more than the receipts
more

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis no the concern would
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
be that we we don't want to set up a
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
situation where all of a sudden you have
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
50 locations open up that become nothing
 
00:48:58.609 --> 00:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
but Lucky Seven powers
 
00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
well that's that's not the intent yeah
 
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
what's the problem with that well we
 
00:49:05.089 --> 00:49:05.099 align:start position:0%
I can understand some people might not
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
think it's a problem but we would think
 
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
that's a problem why I I just don't
 
00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:11.220 align:start position:0%
understand I don't think it's the intent
 
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
of the statute I think the Lucky Seven
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
sales we have limited uh gambling in New
 
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we've limited charity gaming
 
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
meaning the casinos we limit who can
 
00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
sell Lucky Seven tickets
 
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
um and I just think that
 
00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
I think before if that's the road you
 
00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
want to go down the legislature should
 
00:49:32.329 --> 00:49:32.339 align:start position:0%
be taking a serious look at what how to
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
do that and I don't think we're there
 
00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
yet I don't think we've done that yet
 
00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:38.210 align:start position:0%
yet I don't think we've done that yet
follow-up

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up does it impact other games is
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
that the concern well it could it
 
00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
certainly could I mean if you were to
 
00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
open up a parlor across the street from
 
00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
the uh if you go to the strip mall in
 
00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
Epping there's an American Legion there
 
00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
that sells Lucky Sevens they probably
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
have a four or five machines there but
 
00:49:58.609 --> 00:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
if you opened up a place across the
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
street and put in a hundred uh Lucky
 
00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
Seven machines and you had you know
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
promotions and whatnot that could very
 
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
well impact that that Legion
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
got it no question
 
00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:13.380 align:start position:0%
right oh yes representative Doucet
 
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
Jen thank you for taking my question we
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
heard the uh Lottery director testified
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
this morning in reference to HHR
 
00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:24.300 align:start position:0%
machines we're talking about an
 
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
electronic gaming device
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
um I guess my question is to the people
 
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
who operate the Lucky Seven machines go
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
through the same vetting background
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
check criminal check financials check as
 
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
do the the people who
 
00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
operate HHR and that answer is no and
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
that is exactly representative one of
 
00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:47.339 align:start position:0%
the concerns that you you don't do
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
anything near that uh level of scrutiny
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
all right other questions on this side
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:00.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
well it started out as what people would
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
call a pull tab right you rip the card
 
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
off and you reveal whether it could be
 
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
cherries or number sevens or some kind
 
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
of symbol and you win a prize that's we
 
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
call that Lucky Seven across the country
 
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:20.460 align:start position:0%
it's called different things but it's
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
you know I think most commonly known as
 
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
a pull tab ticket so if you think about
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
that ticket uh the legislature has
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
passed laws to allow in addition to the
 
00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
paper pull tab we have electronic
 
00:51:35.329 --> 00:51:35.339 align:start position:0%
versions of that where you can sit and
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
press a button and reveal those boxes
 
00:51:41.569 --> 00:51:41.579 align:start position:0%
and those prizes
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
they are a contained deal it is
 
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
different than a regular electronic game
 
00:51:47.569 --> 00:51:47.579 align:start position:0%
in other words we talk about a deal
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
there are there are a maximum number of
 
00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:53.099 align:start position:0%
tickets in each deal which of course
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
then limits the number of prizes and how
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
many prizes or how much prizes can be
 
00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:00.890 align:start position:0%
many prizes or how much prizes can be
awarded

00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
a Canadian
 
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
um can you explain why why is it that
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
only um the dispensers can pay can or or
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
what the theory behind the dispenser is
 
00:52:14.089 --> 00:52:14.099 align:start position:0%
only doing two dollars but paper tickets
 
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
I can
 
00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:23.210 align:start position:0%
I can
um

00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:23.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
the Lucky Seven tickets are sold by
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
humans in the in when they're in when
 
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
they're in the paper form right
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh somebody mentioned I think it was
 
00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:35.220 align:start position:0%
representative Allen he mentioned the
 
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
what if the if the prize gets hit on the
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
first ticket out of the box that box
 
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
becomes sort of worthless right
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
well reverse that suppose there's a
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
hundred tickets left in the box and
 
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
there's a top prize of X whatever that
 
00:52:52.849 --> 00:52:52.859 align:start position:0%
is a thousand dollars and it hasn't been
 
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
hit yet
 
00:52:56.089 --> 00:52:56.099 align:start position:0%
so if I'm working the bar
 
00:52:58.130 --> 00:52:58.140 align:start position:0%
and I know that
 
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
I could buy that box out and get that
 
00:53:03.049 --> 00:53:03.059 align:start position:0%
ticket or I can call my friend to come
 
00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:05.339 align:start position:0%
down and do it and so when we started
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
talking about the bigger number
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
and of course as we were talking in the
 
00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:11.099 align:start position:0%
senate about 10 but I think it's valid
 
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
even at the two
 
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
we said you know we should limit
 
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
that type of potential activity
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
by saying put that higher price ticket
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
in a game that essentially cannot be
 
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
tampered with
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
representative Susan Ami thank you uh
 
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
Lucky Seven machines you haven't said
 
00:53:37.849 --> 00:53:37.859 align:start position:0%
that yet but they're
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
a lot more stodgy
 
00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
than the slot machines that are the
 
00:53:44.569 --> 00:53:44.579 align:start position:0%
historic racing machines and don't tell
 
00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
me they aren't slot machines all of the
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
people that are talking about it outside
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
of this place say they are but
 
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
and they're a little bit slower than
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
historic racing machines than slot
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
machines are but the Lucky Seven
 
00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
machines as I understand it and as I've
 
00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
in the past seen these things unless
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
they've evolved on do not have the bells
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
whistles and and uh colors and noises
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
that the slot machines have
 
00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:20.540 align:start position:0%
why would anybody open up a ten dollar
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
slot machine um sorry um
 
00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
Lucky Seven machine place
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
well I don't know I can't answer that
 
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
directly why they would except if
 
00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
somebody sees an opportunity to make
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
money I assume they will try to take it
 
00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
we've seen people come in and we have
 
00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:45.180 align:start position:0%
those sweepstakes machines out there in
 
00:54:47.569 --> 00:54:47.579 align:start position:0%
the Marketplace for a while the
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
legislature took action to get rid of
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
those so I think
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.790 --> 00:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you madam
 
00:54:58.800 --> 00:54:59.930 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you madam
chair

chair
 
00:55:02.809 --> 00:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
okay chair recognizes Mike McLaughlin
 
00:55:05.569 --> 00:55:05.579 align:start position:0%
again from Arrow
 
00:55:05.579 --> 00:55:17.809 align:start position:0%
again from Arrow
Arrow

00:55:17.809 --> 00:55:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you again Madam chair members of
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Mike McLaughlin
 
00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:22.140 align:start position:0%
and Lauren Law Office in Conklin
 
00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:23.579 align:start position:0%
represent Arrow International of
 
00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
Cleveland Ohio arrow is a major supplier
 
00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
of Lucky Seven uh tickets and equipment
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire
 
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
um we're in support of the bill as
 
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:32.339 align:start position:0%
written and I think it's important to
 
00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
note the 14
 
00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
000 uh maximum amount of tickets in a
 
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
deal has no relevance to whether the
 
00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
ticket's tend AutoZone we can design
 
00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
ticket runs at 500 200 600 3 000 it's
 
00:55:48.049 --> 00:55:48.059 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to the discussion on whether
 
00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:49.460 align:start position:0%
we should have a ten dollar ticket
 
00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:52.859 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to have 140 000 to or
 
00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
whatever the net cost is to buy a roll
 
00:55:59.089 --> 00:55:59.099 align:start position:0%
of fourteen thousand Lucky Seven tickets
 
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
as with the ten dollar ticket but the
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
ten dollar ticket and the bill as it was
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh put forth in the Senate and supported
 
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
in the Senate will allow the Social
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
Clubs who are now competing against
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
other gambling entities and what was
 
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
seen here in the last year or so last
 
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
five years is we have two repeating
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
gambling paradigms we have the
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
charitable casinos and we have the Bingo
 
00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
Lucky 7 world
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
and the Social Clubs Lucky Sevens the
 
00:56:31.849 --> 00:56:31.859 align:start position:0%
bingo at the casino world has uh table
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
games and HHR machines and the build you
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
guys passed a couple of weeks ago puts
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
the HHR bed up to 25 dollars
 
00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
so what we're looking at is a
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
competitive world where one half of the
 
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
world is looking for a ten dollar ticket
 
00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
while the other half of the world has
 
00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
got a 25 ticket they also have I think
 
00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
they were looking to raise that to 50 in
 
00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
the Senate so the 10 ticket
 
00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
in the VFW of the American Legion would
 
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
not be a hundred and forty thousand
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of tickets in the machine
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
it would be enough in the in the machine
 
00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
to give an interesting and a competitive
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
jackpot and would allow or help the
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
people who use the Lucky 7 machines to
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
maintain their base so when the Alpine
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
Club in Manchester or the Ukrainian club
 
00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
or the VFW selling one dollar tickets
 
00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
now uh would get the opportunity to sell
 
00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
a ticket that is more in line but still
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
uh 80 percent less than what's being
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
sold in the casino so a little bit of a
 
00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
competitive balance by having a ten
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
dollar ticket no one has to have it uh
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
to think that somebody's going to run
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
out and start a Lucky Seven parlor I
 
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
can't imagine it but to look at the base
 
00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
they have today and tell them you're
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
going to be able to get a ticket that's
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
more competitive and still less than
 
00:57:54.049 --> 00:57:54.059 align:start position:0%
half of the tickets available in other
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
venues it's a fairness issue I'd rather
 
00:57:58.370 --> 00:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
see the bill would be raised to a 25
 
00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:01.140 align:start position:0%
ticket but again the maximum limit of
 
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
tickets is irrelevant to the discussion
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
because it's never going to happen
 
00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.410 align:start position:0%
because it's never going to happen
um

00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
Lucky Sevens of the lifeblood of the
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
Bingo Lucky 7 world as we talked before
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
the Bingo pays about 87 percent of its
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
take to the player Lucky Sevens have a
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
guaranteed return when you buy a box of
 
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
Lucky Sevens or a deal of Lucky Sevens
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
the charity knows what they're going to
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
make because a certain percentage goes
 
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:28.140 align:start position:0%
out in prizes and the rest goes in their
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
pocket uh it's the player knows that
 
00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:32.460 align:start position:0%
there's a certain percentage they're
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
going to win their absolute wins you can
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
play a slot machine or a not too too
 
00:58:39.049 --> 00:58:39.059 align:start position:0%
familiar with HHR machines but there's
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
no um a player can sit down and play for
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
two days on a slot machine and maybe
 
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
never win a nickel
 
00:58:47.809 --> 00:58:47.819 align:start position:0%
but a Lucky Seven deal has guaranteed
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
return and that's why the Charities use
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
them they know what they're going to
 
00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
make so we at Arrow would design deals
 
00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
that are attractive to the player and
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
affordable to the charity so we strongly
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
support the 10 ticket again it's a
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
other questions representative leapley
 
00:59:15.049 --> 00:59:15.059 align:start position:0%
um so if
 
00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
if uh entity wanted to buy wanted to
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
have seven dollar tickets could they do
 
00:59:24.289 --> 00:59:24.299 align:start position:0%
that or is this like 10 1 and 50 cents
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
well there's Now 50 Cent tickets in the
 
00:59:29.089 --> 00:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
dollar takes for paper and if they want
 
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:31.140 align:start position:0%
to create or look to this bill and say
 
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
the uh ticket shown a lot of C ten
 
00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:35.940 align:start position:0%
dollars they could have a 5.608 I don't
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
think whatever the manufacturer would be
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
willing to create because in order to
 
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
create these tickets you have the
 
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
technology that has to be put together
 
00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
the design of the game the games are
 
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
designed to be attractive they're not as
 
00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:50.700 align:start position:0%
attractive as um uh you know bells and
 
00:59:52.849 --> 00:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
whistles but they are not black and
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
white uh pieces of paper they're they're
 
00:59:56.809 --> 00:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
exciting a little bit for the player to
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
look at but you could have any tickets
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
you any size ticket you deem up to a
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
so um I get that uh
 
01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
that there's no requirement
 
01:00:20.089 --> 01:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
to have a ten dollar ticket if this
 
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
passes but
 
01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.410 align:start position:0%
passes but
um

01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:23.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
but it's permissive so
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
so it's allowed if this goes through and
 
01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't a casino
 
01:00:38.589 --> 01:00:38.599 align:start position:0%
uh see this is another way to attract
 
01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
customers you know everything's on the
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
margin so it might be that there's some
 
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
people out there that would like this
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
kind of machine it's a little bit
 
01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
different why wouldn't they uh
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
um go to something that becomes more
 
01:00:56.809 --> 01:00:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I don't know but I see no reason why
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't if it's the uh the whole
 
01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
gambling world is based on how much I
 
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
can make and the algorithms that created
 
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
the HHR machines have a certain
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
guaranteed return we know the operator
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
is going to get 12 percent of the uh the
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
net machine drop and if these if these
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
gonna have Lucky Seven machines because
 
01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:23.819 align:start position:0%
you get 14 you probably take that it's a
 
01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:26.339 align:start position:0%
um it's a decision based on the
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
probability of how much I can make and
 
01:01:30.289 --> 01:01:30.299 align:start position:0%
if you can make more with um with
 
01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
another machine I'm sure the other
 
01:01:34.849 --> 01:01:34.859 align:start position:0%
machine will wipe out the obsolete the
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
one you can't make enough money on but
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
again the the putting a
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
favoring the uh
 
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
taking recognize that we have two sets
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
of operations here in the state we have
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
what some can say is the smaller
 
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
Charities the Lucky Seven Bingo and vfws
 
01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
with the Lucky Sevens and the mega
 
01:01:59.950 --> 01:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
operations which are the HHR casinos
 
01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
this bill will at least give them a
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
little bit of parity with a 10 with the
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
ability to create a ten dollar ticket
 
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
which is an electronic ticket which the
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
lottery knows each and every nickel that
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
goes into the uh into the pot what comes
 
01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
out it's easy off that's why the bill
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
was written to make it electronic only
 
01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
so that the audit Trail is clean and as
 
01:02:23.329 --> 01:02:23.339 align:start position:0%
representative Albany said uh with
 
01:02:26.569 --> 01:02:26.579 align:start position:0%
mixing several deals together you won't
 
01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
be able to absolutely identify gee the
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
big number is gone so you can keep
 
01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:31.859 align:start position:0%
playing because it's not so obvious when
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
Joe says I got the 500 winner and
 
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
everyone goes up put the Box away I
 
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
don't buy any more of those the
 
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
electronic it's um there's more than one
 
01:02:41.089 --> 01:02:41.099 align:start position:0%
terminal there's not people you know
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
they're playing it in the uh multiple
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
deals in the same computer uh makes more
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
prizes available and people don't
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
yep representative fellows
 
01:02:58.250 --> 01:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm having a hard time with the
 
01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
terminology in the bill so what I see
 
01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
here is I have you have
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
um Lucky Seven ticket
 
01:03:06.839 --> 01:03:08.089 align:start position:0%
um Lucky Seven ticket
pack

01:03:08.089 --> 01:03:08.099 align:start position:0%
pack
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
or a ticket card
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
or you also have a dispenser which I was
 
01:03:15.359 --> 01:03:16.970 align:start position:0%
or you also have a dispenser which I was
assuming

01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
assuming
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
dispensed a card and you're talking
 
01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
about electronic machine which doesn't
 
01:03:26.329 --> 01:03:26.339 align:start position:0%
dispense anything it just shows it on
 
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
the screen so I'm getting really
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
confused and my other question is why do
 
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
why would anybody want 50 Cent ones well
 
01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
welcome to the world of Lucky Sevens the
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the last 10 years we've had an
 
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
evolution from the paper ticket to a old
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
paramutual commission that said you
 
01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
could have a ticket that could be
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
produced in a dispenser originally we
 
01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
had dispensers with a pile of four or
 
01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
five and chickens you'd pull them out
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
then the computer people of the world
 
01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
said you know we can produce a pull tab
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
which emulates the action the exactly of
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
a piece of paper and so we have now we
 
01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
have both paper tickets and computer
 
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
generator tickets so you see some terms
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
in this bill that are words of art a
 
01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
ticket is both a piece of paper today at
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
a computer program
 
01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:18.740 align:start position:0%
a deal can be a pile of tickets in a box
 
01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
or a entry into the central processing
 
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
unit of the dispenser so you have a
 
01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:26.220 align:start position:0%
physical ticket and you have an
 
01:04:29.569 --> 01:04:29.579 align:start position:0%
electronic ticket and they're both uh in
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
the same under the same licensing and
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
the same uh Paradigm in that they have a
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
certain amount of winning tickets in a
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
deal and the cost of the deal is less
 
01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
than you have a net guaranteed return so
 
01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
if you pay a thousand dollars for the
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
Box you give a 200 price you net 800 but
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
there's two forms of the exact same
 
01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
thing there's the electronic form and
 
01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
the paper form the
 
01:04:57.049 --> 01:04:57.059 align:start position:0%
perception of the older people playing
 
01:04:59.030 --> 01:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
bingo love 50 Cent tickets for five
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
dollars you get 25 tickets
 
01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
so that that bottom line here Mary uh I
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
forget Mary's and she passed away
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
Mary Griffin who was a senior in Derry
 
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
and a big supporter of senior
 
01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
opportunities for gambling wanted to
 
01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
keep that 50 Cent ticket so uh you know
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
a box of 50 Cent tickets people can play
 
01:05:21.049 --> 01:05:21.059 align:start position:0%
for two or three dollars and have more
 
01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
tickets more opportunity so as the
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
market matured people said I don't want
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
to buy a 50 Cent ticket give me a dollar
 
01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
ticket give me a two dollar ticket uh
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
same process just a bigger
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
pay in bigger payout so there's exact
 
01:05:38.089 --> 01:05:38.099 align:start position:0%
they're exactly the same but one exists
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
as many things exist today inside the
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
computer and the other exists in the
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
they're the same but if you look at
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
those words they're just words of art
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
the ticket is electronic or paper and
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
the dispenses either the computer or the
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
person handing it out
 
01:05:57.730 --> 01:05:57.740 align:start position:0%
representative Susan Owen thank you
 
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
there is one other difference between
 
01:06:05.809 --> 01:06:05.819 align:start position:0%
the paper and the Machine and as I said
 
01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
the machine is pretty
 
01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.609 align:start position:0%
the machine is pretty
slow

01:06:09.609 --> 01:06:09.619 align:start position:0%
slow
 
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
compared to the HRM which is slow can a
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
bit compared with the slot machine on
 
01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:19.490 align:start position:0%
bit compared with the slot machine on
but

01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
the the difference between them
 
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
generally in gambling isn't it that on a
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
person can who is addicted can spend all
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
of their time sitting in front of the
 
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
machine pushing the button
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
hoping to win enough to make up for what
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
they've lost
 
01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't that make a difference in when
 
01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:49.140 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a social game like
 
01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.569 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a social game like
bingo

01:06:50.569 --> 01:06:50.579 align:start position:0%
bingo
 
01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
or the people who show up at three
 
01:06:55.789 --> 01:06:55.799 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the afternoon to have some
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
coffee and chat with their neighbors and
 
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
friends that they only see at that bingo
 
01:07:04.970 --> 01:07:04.980 align:start position:0%
hall on if they're instead playing the
 
01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
machine is there a question related to
 
01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
that yeah I did put some questions okay
 
01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:12.539 align:start position:0%
your points are always valid relative to
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
the person who can't control their
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
gambling instincts and a certain type of
 
01:07:20.089 --> 01:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
device might uh augment their bad habit
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
but there's I'm sitting in front of the
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
ways of means commission and looking in
 
01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
the history of the last 10 years we've
 
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
decided that there's something that
 
01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
outweighs that protection of the person
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
I see some lit up
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
things over there any else want to ask a
 
01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much for
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
entertaining all of our questions thank
 
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
you very much that chair recognizes Fran
 
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record my name is
 
01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
Fran Wendell though I represent
 
01:08:08.329 --> 01:08:08.339 align:start position:0%
Powerhouse gaming and I must apologize
 
01:08:11.569 --> 01:08:11.579 align:start position:0%
to the committee my orange badge decided
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
to go on vacation and is hiding
 
01:08:16.249 --> 01:08:16.259 align:start position:0%
somewhere in a pocket so I am a
 
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
registered lobbyist and I'm speaking on
 
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
behalf of my client
 
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
um we support the ten dollar
 
01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
that we are open to something lesser as
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
we talked
 
01:08:35.769 --> 01:08:35.779 align:start position:0%
we became concerned about
 
01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:37.329 align:start position:0%
we became concerned about
proliferation

01:08:37.329 --> 01:08:37.339 align:start position:0%
proliferation
 
01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:41.900 align:start position:0%
new new places
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
and I I know some of you who have
 
01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
followed this for many years can't
 
01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
believe that you're hearing me say
 
01:08:51.769 --> 01:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
perhaps ten dollars is a little bit too
 
01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
quick uh too aggressive
 
01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:55.809 align:start position:0%
quick uh too aggressive
um

01:08:55.809 --> 01:08:55.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:59.329 --> 01:08:59.339 align:start position:0%
if the committee wanted to consider a
 
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
phase-in you know to two dollars or
 
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
three dollars and then after two years
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
if no problems have come up that it
 
01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
could increase to the next level uh that
 
01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
might be a little more convoluted than
 
01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
you care to do
 
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
um just as a matter of point the thing
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
that I like about the electronic means
 
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
of Lucky Sevens is as I've grown older
 
01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
my vision is not what it used to be and
 
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
to open this little peel thing and you
 
01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
have to get a magnifying glass out to
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
read it is problematic for the elderly
 
01:09:43.729 --> 01:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
and also I have gotten arthritis
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
somewhat in my fingers and peeling those
 
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
tabs is not the easiest so I can see
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
whether I won or lost right there on a
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
well-lit big screen and it makes it much
 
01:09:55.679 --> 01:09:57.350 align:start position:0%
well-lit big screen and it makes it much
easier

01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
easier
 
01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:57.970 align:start position:0%
easier
um

01:09:57.970 --> 01:09:57.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
as the prior speaker mentioned the
 
01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
electronic form is much easier for
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
lottery to audit everything is right
 
01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
there in black and white whether the
 
01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
person chooses to ask for a copy of the
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
winnings from the machine or just to go
 
01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
with the readout
 
01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:21.590 align:start position:0%
with the readout
um

01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
the reason the primary reason to
 
01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
increase it was to give them a little
 
01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
bit of parity when you have these
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
facilities that
 
01:10:35.209 --> 01:10:35.219 align:start position:0%
have vets that are now 25 when you look
 
01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
at the old scratch tickets when they
 
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
started out they were very small and now
 
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
you routinely see winners that bought a
 
01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
10 ticket or twenty five dollar ticket a
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
one chance you know type thing with the
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
scratch tickets so it's not out of the
 
01:10:54.649 --> 01:10:54.659 align:start position:0%
realm to make these facilities
 
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
more competitive I wish there were a
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
little bit more talking about the good
 
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
that these Charities and service
 
01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
organizations do with the money that
 
01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
they are getting if you were to look at
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
long term statistics from Lottery you
 
01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
will see that Bingo sales were going
 
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
down down down down Lucky Sevens were
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
kind of static but when Electronics came
 
01:11:26.689 --> 01:11:26.699 align:start position:0%
into play it was like everybody had an
 
01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
advantage everybody's numbers initially
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
went up Bingo has returned to the slide
 
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
could be because there's so fewer
 
01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
facilities because it's just not worth
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
it for the time involved for the
 
01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
Charities to be able to cover those
 
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:41.990 align:start position:0%
Charities to be able to cover those
hours

01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
my client would be fine for something
 
01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
less than ten dollars
 
01:11:52.729 --> 01:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
um we'll leave that up to you two
 
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
dollars is a very easy change or three
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
dollars but we will support whatever the
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
committee decides
 
01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
we just don't know if there are
 
01:12:05.209 --> 01:12:05.219 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences with all of a
 
01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
sudden going boom and we want to prevent
 
01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
that believe me I my client most of
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
their facilities are the smaller more
 
01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
North Country facilities who probably
 
01:12:24.169 --> 01:12:24.179 align:start position:0%
will not change from a dollar they'll
 
01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
leave their machines at a dollar or they
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
might try two dollars
 
01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
um I would think that the only ones who
 
01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
really would want this would be large
 
01:12:34.199 --> 01:12:36.470 align:start position:0%
really would want this would be large
Halls

01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
Halls
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
that are close to the casinos along the
 
01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
borderline of the state to keep those
 
01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
people here instead of taking their
 
01:12:48.169 --> 01:12:48.179 align:start position:0%
dollars to Massachusetts
 
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
um I'd be more than happy to answer into
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.649 --> 01:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
speaker said there's nothing else to be
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
said we have asked a lot of questions
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
but we have a lot of new people in this
 
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
committee so representative fellows has
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
a question if you'd be open to this like
 
01:13:09.370 --> 01:13:09.380 align:start position:0%
Groundhog Day
 
01:13:12.649 --> 01:13:12.659 align:start position:0%
for you maybe representative fellows so
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm from I'm from um Plymouth
 
01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
holderness in Hebron District so I'm
 
01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
glad to hear somebody who recognizes
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
that there are things going on north of
 
01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
Concord and um can you tell me again who
 
01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
your client is and where you have
 
01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
facilities in the North Country
 
01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh did bring the list with me up the
 
01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
Plymouth VFW I believe is one
 
01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:38.090 align:start position:0%
Plymouth VFW I believe is one
um

01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:40.729 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:13:40.729 --> 01:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
North Country is could be seasonal as
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
well for the most part of the year they
 
01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.570 align:start position:0%
well for the most part of the year they
might

01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
stay at one dollar or go up to two
 
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
dollars but when you have Prime ski
 
01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
season or summer season they might say
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay for the months of such and such to
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
such and such we'll try the higher
 
01:14:03.290 --> 01:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
ticket when we have a lot of people from
 
01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
out of state that are used to having
 
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
representative Platt thank you I've
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
heard support for two dollars I've heard
 
01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
support for ten dollars you're flexible
 
01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
could go anywhere in that range have you
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
placed odds in what ways and means we'll
 
01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:26.450 align:start position:0%
placed odds in what ways and means we'll
do

01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
it was a joke uh have you placed odds on
 
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
what ways and means we'll come out with
 
01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
I suspect you'll
 
01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:40.820 align:start position:0%
take a bowl and put some numbers in it
 
01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
we don't want to trigger a long time
 
01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
study by starting with something lesser
 
01:14:50.689 --> 01:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
having in the back of our mind well if
 
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
this goes fine
 
01:14:55.729 --> 01:14:55.739 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll come back and say now can we
 
01:14:59.450 --> 01:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
go to five and bear in mind it does not
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
mandate it says shall not exceed 10.
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
so a lot of them may not change from the
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
dollar but it gives the enabling
 
01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
legislation the opportunity for those
 
01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
who feel that it would help their
 
01:15:18.050 --> 01:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
viability that they could do so and
 
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
nothing says once you do it you have to
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
stay there if you buy a deal and it just
 
01:15:27.169 --> 01:15:27.179 align:start position:0%
doesn't work then you sell out that deal
 
01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
and you go and representative Olney was
 
01:15:32.209 --> 01:15:32.219 align:start position:0%
perfectly right when it used to be one
 
01:15:34.729 --> 01:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
deal three thousand five hundred tickets
 
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
and it was a a busy night you got
 
01:15:38.770 --> 01:15:38.780 align:start position:0%
somebody sitting at the end of the bar
 
01:15:41.930 --> 01:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
watching because a lot of times it's the
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
bartender who ends up selling the
 
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
tickets they're counting and they say
 
01:15:49.729 --> 01:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
the 500 hasn't been hit but when we were
 
01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
able to commingly it started out being
 
01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
called co-mingling before they
 
01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
officially increased the deal to up to
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
fourteen thousand it's harder to keep
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
track of
 
01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
particularly when you've got a machine
 
01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
there and a machine there and a machine
 
01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
there it's really hard to follow who's
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
winning and what they won and how many
 
01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
more would be left because with multiple
 
01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
deals you don't have just one 500 prize
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
you might have
 
01:16:17.159 --> 01:16:18.410 align:start position:0%
you might have
six

01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
six
 
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
so it adds a little bit of a safety
 
01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
check there as well
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you okay the
 
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
chair will recognize Ashley
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to be able to pronounce
 
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
your last name from Grover gaming please
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
come up and introduce yourself and I
 
01:16:35.209 --> 01:16:35.219 align:start position:0%
know you but I don't know how to
 
01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
pronounce your last name
 
01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
it's okay nobody does
 
01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
my name is Ashley chairmanus and I do
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
represent grower gaming here in the
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
state I wanted to speak to the committee
 
01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much for hearing me
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the two dollar ticket we do
 
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
support a two dollar ticket because
 
01:16:58.130 --> 01:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
let's keep in mind that the majority of
 
01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
our customers right now our Partnerships
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
are the posts and The Lodges of of the
 
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
world the vfws the American Legions the
 
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
Moose lodges the Elks clubs
 
01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
these are locations where if they were
 
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
to offer a ten dollar ticket you are
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
looking at a total payout of
 
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
approximately a hundred and twenty six
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars if a top prize now keep
 
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
in mind there's a prize pool that would
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
total that if a top prize is ten
 
01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars your average VFW Post
 
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
or Elks Lodge is not going to have that
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
kind of cash on hand
 
01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
um let's also keep in mind that we are
 
01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
speaking about casinos and we are
 
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
speaking about bingo halls but our
 
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
actual customer is the charity that is
 
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
involved with those organizations so
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
while we partner with bingo halls while
 
01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
we partner with casinos
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
we in fact have an agreement with the
 
01:18:02.209 --> 01:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
charity it is the charity that
 
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
um does the payouts it is the the
 
01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
charity that is is paying these players
 
01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
so although we would love to down the
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
line see a ten dollar ticket be
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
available on an electronic Lucky 7
 
01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
machine I think a two dollar ticket
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
would be an excellent way to
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
um ease our customers into that kind of
 
01:18:30.169 --> 01:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
a world where those payouts would
 
01:18:31.490 --> 01:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
actually be
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
possible for them
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
I do know that there are a majority of
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
our customers we do have 19 total
 
01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
locations that we serve right now in the
 
01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
state and I would say that the majority
 
01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
of them would absolutely take on a two
 
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
dollar ticket they would not take on a
 
01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:54.770 align:start position:0%
dollar ticket they would not take on a
10.

01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you did you have anything else to
 
01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
add I do not would you be open to
 
01:18:59.570 --> 01:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
questions absolutely excellent
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative Jordan ulery
 
01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
how did it turned out if there's so many
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
people concerned about the 10 figure how
 
01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
did it pass the Senate
 
01:19:14.050 --> 01:19:14.060 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
and this is just speaking my own
 
01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:18.950 align:start position:0%
and this is just speaking my own
thoughts

01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
um I think we want to everybody wants to
 
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
see these fraternal organizations the
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
veteran organizations that the
 
01:19:28.729 --> 01:19:28.739 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations in New
 
01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they want to see them profit
 
01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
so that they can do great things in the
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
community being able to increase a
 
01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
the electronic wager is a great way to
 
01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
do that I think
 
01:19:46.729 --> 01:19:46.739 align:start position:0%
having it up to ten dollars is a great
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
way to kind of present that position but
 
01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
after speaking with
 
01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:53.930 align:start position:0%
after speaking with
um

01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
our team we did decide that two dollars
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
is kind of a more realistic offering for
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
these organizations so yes initially it
 
01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
was ten dollars but after going back and
 
01:20:10.729 --> 01:20:10.739 align:start position:0%
um kind of thinking about it a little
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
more deeply and talking to some of our
 
01:20:18.410 --> 01:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
locations as well we decided that the
 
01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
offering a lower wager amount such as
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
two dollars would be a more viable offer
 
01:20:26.159 --> 01:20:27.169 align:start position:0%
two dollars would be a more viable offer
for

01:20:27.169 --> 01:20:27.179 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
your veteran organizations or fraternals
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
through non-profits of the world
 
01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you welcome representative fellows
 
01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
I apologize I missed you okay go ahead
 
01:20:39.410 --> 01:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you um can you just tell me what
 
01:20:41.930 --> 01:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
your thoughts are on the 50 Cent ticket
 
01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
do you think it's good to keep that or
 
01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
you don't need it or does it really
 
01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
what would be the impact of getting rid
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
of it I guess
 
01:20:53.689 --> 01:20:53.699 align:start position:0%
um I would absolutely not suggest
 
01:20:56.050 --> 01:20:56.060 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the 50 Cent ticket
 
01:20:59.209 --> 01:20:59.219 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has been used to a 50 Cent
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
ticket whether it was a paper pull tab
 
01:21:03.709 --> 01:21:03.719 align:start position:0%
or an electronic
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
um Lucky Seven for as long as I am
 
01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
familiar with and I haven't been in this
 
01:21:12.890 --> 01:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
industry for as long as some people have
 
01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
been um
 
01:21:17.050 --> 01:21:17.060 align:start position:0%
members of some of these organizations
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
so the the idea of of removing a 50 Cent
 
01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
ticket I think would be detrimental to a
 
01:21:28.669 --> 01:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
lot of these organizations
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative lburger
 
01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm having a hard
 
01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
time understanding
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
why putting an upper limit on a ticket
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
that doesn't say You must charge this
 
01:21:46.850 --> 01:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
but you may charge this would be an
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
issue for an organization that could
 
01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
simply say we don't want to charge 10 we
 
01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
want to charge two I'd like to hear your
 
01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:55.970 align:start position:0%
want to charge two I'd like to hear your
comments

01:21:55.970 --> 01:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
um so thank you very much for the
 
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
question again I can only speak to my
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that
 
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:03.649 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that
um

01:22:03.649 --> 01:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
but there is a lot of work that goes on
 
01:22:09.370 --> 01:22:09.380 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes as far as creating
 
01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
these particular deals that involve
 
01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
different Ouija amounts different wager
 
01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:21.179 align:start position:0%
sizes so for a company to
 
01:22:21.179 --> 01:22:22.189 align:start position:0%
sizes so for a company to
um

01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:25.729 --> 01:22:25.739 align:start position:0%
support a two or five or ten dollar
 
01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
wager and then have to come up with
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
payout scenarios for all of those and
 
01:22:34.370 --> 01:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
then offer them to organizations that
 
01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
most likely will not offer a ten dollar
 
01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:40.070 align:start position:0%
most likely will not offer a ten dollar
wager

01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
wager
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
um in in my eyes that's that those are
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
not scenarios that would be beneficial
 
01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:52.490 --> 01:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
so it'd be very expensive and time
 
01:22:54.410 --> 01:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
consuming for you to program every
 
01:22:56.689 --> 01:22:56.699 align:start position:0%
different scenario yes thank you
 
01:22:58.370 --> 01:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
representative Elber did you have a
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes I do thank you um
 
01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
you could though say that if you know
 
01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
that this group of your customers and
 
01:23:09.169 --> 01:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
maybe it's your entire group of
 
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
customers doesn't want more than a two
 
01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
dollar ticket that could be all you
 
01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:15.590 align:start position:0%
dollar ticket that could be all you
offer

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
offer
 
01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:16.790 align:start position:0%
offer
correct

01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you so much thank you
 
01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
okay so this is we're on Senate Bill 139
 
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
still I have don't have any more pink
 
01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
cards is there anyone else here would
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
okay that's why I'm just re-clarifying
 
01:23:39.169 --> 01:23:39.179 align:start position:0%
where we're at because we went a little
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
over there okay so no other pin cards no
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
other questions we will now close the
 
01:23:46.010 --> 01:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
public healing on Senate Bill 139. okay
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
now we will open the public hearing on
 
01:23:52.490 --> 01:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 192.
 
01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
relative to the hours that Lucky 7
 
01:23:57.709 --> 01:23:57.719 align:start position:0%
tickets may be sold and and for the
 
01:24:00.610 --> 01:24:00.620 align:start position:0%
record I am involved in Lucky 7 tickets
 
01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh and we recognize Senator Susie
 
01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:05.209 align:start position:0%
uh and we recognize Senator Susie
welcome

01:24:05.209 --> 01:24:05.219 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair members
 
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record I'm
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
Donna soucy I represent Senate District
 
01:24:14.570 --> 01:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
18 comprised of five Wards in the city
 
01:24:18.189 --> 01:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
of Manchester and the town of Litchfield
 
01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
and I am here today it appears between
 
01:24:25.010 --> 01:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
you and lunch so I will be brief in the
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
explanation it is a very short bill
 
01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow for Lucky sick
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
Lucky Seven tickets at bingo
 
01:24:38.090 --> 01:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
to be sold starting at 8 A.M instead of
 
01:24:41.689 --> 01:24:41.699 align:start position:0%
the current law which is 12 p.m the
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
amendment that the Senate made was to
 
01:24:46.729 --> 01:24:46.739 align:start position:0%
make this effective upon passage I
 
01:24:48.169 --> 01:24:48.179 align:start position:0%
believe there are some folks who will
 
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
testify after me that can speak more
 
01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
vividly to the impact of this but
 
01:24:57.169 --> 01:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
essentially there are other
 
01:24:59.930 --> 01:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
gaming entities that are now selling the
 
01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
Lucky 7 tickets earlier and this is to
 
01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
create parity within the statute this
 
01:25:09.410 --> 01:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
statute applies to those doing bingo
 
01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
games and as all of you know based on
 
01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
the discussions here uh there are many
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
forms of charitable gaming that we now
 
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
allow in the state this would allow for
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
the sale of those tickets at the same
 
01:25:23.330 --> 01:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
time that other entities currently
 
01:25:25.130 --> 01:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
charge them I actually think it may have
 
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
been an Omission when we change the
 
01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
statute but nonetheless I know there are
 
01:25:32.630 --> 01:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
some entities in Manchester in
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
particular that would be impacted by
 
01:25:36.410 --> 01:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
this and that supported the legislation
 
01:25:38.689 --> 01:25:38.699 align:start position:0%
so with that I would ask for your
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
support and happy to take any questions
 
01:25:44.209 --> 01:25:44.219 align:start position:0%
thank you so much questions from the
 
01:25:47.090 --> 01:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
community representative Susan Almy I
 
01:25:51.410 --> 01:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
hate delaying lunch but on Valerie King
 
01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
according to the Senate minutes on
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
testified that
 
01:26:02.209 --> 01:26:02.219 align:start position:0%
the time was it was never allowed at 8
 
01:26:02.219 --> 01:26:03.410 align:start position:0%
the time was it was never allowed at 8
A.M

01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
A.M
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
and there were two people that talked
 
01:26:10.129 --> 01:26:10.139 align:start position:0%
about how they
 
01:26:12.649 --> 01:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
they've lost an hour from their Lucky
 
01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
Seven sales because of what the change
 
01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
that was made earlier and one that opens
 
01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
at 9 30 A.M
 
01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:27.780 align:start position:0%
so 8 A.M seems awfully early
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
is that I'm not sure whether they
 
01:26:34.209 --> 01:26:34.219 align:start position:0%
misquoted miss King
 
01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:36.780 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
well the reason that you will hear is
 
01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
that some of the entities open early and
 
01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
have coffee or refreshment people get
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
their bingo to in anticipation of the
 
01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:52.330 align:start position:0%
their bingo to in anticipation of the
game

01:26:52.330 --> 01:26:52.340 align:start position:0%
game
 
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
this does not require anyone to open at
 
01:26:57.410 --> 01:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
8 A.M it only says that those and I
 
01:26:58.850 --> 01:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
believe at least one of the entities
 
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
because that was the request when I put
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
in the legislation does open that early
 
01:27:05.689 --> 01:27:05.699 align:start position:0%
and would like the ability to sell at
 
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.209 --> 01:27:11.219 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions from the
 
01:27:11.219 --> 01:27:12.470 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions from the
committee

01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
is there any kind of restriction on the
 
01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
Bingo part of it the hours of for Bingo
 
01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:23.110 align:start position:0%
Bingo part of it the hours of for Bingo
um

01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
we I
 
01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
had the statute open
 
01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:29.270 align:start position:0%
had the statute open
um

01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
I would need to defer to the department
 
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
because I don't see it in the chapter
 
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
before me but this is within the time
 
01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
period that some of the Bingos do
 
01:27:43.129 --> 01:27:43.139 align:start position:0%
currently open and they want the ability
 
01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
to sell the Lucky Sevens during that
 
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
time so I can't tell you the Restriction
 
01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
um representative fellows but perhaps
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you okay the
 
01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes
 
01:27:57.540 --> 01:27:58.250 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes
um

01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
Mike McLaughlin again from Community
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
good morning again
 
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
Madam chair members the committee Mike
 
01:28:12.010 --> 01:28:12.020 align:start position:0%
McLaughlin from Community Bingo Center
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
the issue with this bill of reason was
 
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
put in was the Community Bingo Center on
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
Saturday and Sunday was running double
 
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
sessions so the initial charity would
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
come in in the morning and sell their
 
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
tickets and I think you've heard earlier
 
01:28:28.129 --> 01:28:28.139 align:start position:0%
today what the basic operation of a
 
01:28:30.890 --> 01:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
bingo event is people Gather in the
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
runners go around the hall selling the
 
01:28:34.729 --> 01:28:34.739 align:start position:0%
tickets the tickets are mostly sold
 
01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
before the bingo starts so they a couple
 
01:28:39.229 --> 01:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
hours before bingo starts to passing out
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
the tickets people paying for them
 
01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
they're looking for the winners when the
 
01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
bingo game starts everyone sits down and
 
01:28:46.129 --> 01:28:46.139 align:start position:0%
plays the bingo game because the Bingo
 
01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
bars come up and the balls are up and
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
you get up Dobby or Bingo paper so the
 
01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
operation of a typical bingo game has
 
01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:54.780 align:start position:0%
two stages the sale of Lucky Seven
 
01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
tickets then the bingo game itself so
 
01:28:59.570 --> 01:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
the bingo games usually will have five
 
01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
to seven games per night of Bingo but
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
the Lucky Sevens or sold before the
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
bingo game starts so what had happened
 
01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
was there were a couple of charities in
 
01:29:09.530 --> 01:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
Manchester who had the early really a
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
session on Saturday and Sunday and
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
suddenly they ran a foul of the existing
 
01:29:16.129 --> 01:29:16.139 align:start position:0%
law because they were selling Lucky
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
Seven tickets before I think it was 11
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
A.M so what we did with this building we
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
asked in the Susie was to move it back a
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
certain amount of time and by the time
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
we went through in the Senate they set
 
01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
it to 8 A.M because that is the same
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
time that the casino and operations may
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
open they can run from 8 A.M to 4 00 a.m
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
the next day now the Bingo can run from
 
01:29:41.450 --> 01:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
8 A.M to 1 a.m of the next day so it's
 
01:29:44.330 --> 01:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
not a uh this is not a sea change of any
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
stretch this puts the starting time for
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
gambling or charitable gaming events at
 
01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
the same time in both ends of the Bingo
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
Paradigm and the casino game Paradigm
 
01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:54.900 align:start position:0%
but what it does do for instance the
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
Charities who may teslaire behind me
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
will say we need a couple hours before
 
01:30:00.590 --> 01:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
we start the noontime game so 8 A.M
 
01:30:02.570 --> 01:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
they're not going to start at 8 A.M
 
01:30:04.189 --> 01:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
unless they're going to have a 10
 
01:30:06.410 --> 01:30:06.420 align:start position:0%
o'clock game but the uh it gives them
 
01:30:08.450 --> 01:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
the flexibility and it makes every
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
gambling event charitable game event the
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
same opportunity to open at the same
 
01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
time and helps them avoid getting in
 
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
trouble with the lottery that's the main
 
01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
representative Susan almie
 
01:30:26.209 --> 01:30:26.219 align:start position:0%
thank you on I remember us being told at
 
01:30:30.890 --> 01:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
various times that there were people who
 
01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:31.669 align:start position:0%
various times that there were people who
were

01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:30:31.679 --> 01:30:32.930 align:start position:0%
were
were

01:30:32.930 --> 01:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:34.129 align:start position:0%
were
um

01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:34.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:38.390 --> 01:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
using the Bingo machines the the Lucky
 
01:30:43.850 --> 01:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
Seven machines on during maybe nine ten
 
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
hours of the day when there was a one
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
hour bingo game that day
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
is that well I think what you're talking
 
01:30:56.209 --> 01:30:56.219 align:start position:0%
about is the last uh we had a issue over
 
01:31:00.350 --> 01:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
the last five years of uh casinos that
 
01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
had Lucky Seven machines that were
 
01:31:05.090 --> 01:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
required to play Bingo
 
01:31:09.229 --> 01:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
so those bingo games were opened at a
 
01:31:10.729 --> 01:31:10.739 align:start position:0%
certain time during the day which would
 
01:31:12.410 --> 01:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
then allow them to sell Lucky Seven
 
01:31:15.290 --> 01:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
tickets in his wisdom the legislature
 
01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
decided you don't even need the bingo
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
game anymore so that question becomes
 
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat moot in that they don't even
 
01:31:25.450 --> 01:31:25.460 align:start position:0%
have a bingo requirement in a licensed
 
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
games of chance facility
 
01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
but what we're talking about today is
 
01:31:33.950 --> 01:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
the bingo game has to be played we're
 
01:31:36.110 --> 01:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
playing seven eight games a night and
 
01:31:40.330 --> 01:31:40.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome okay
 
01:31:46.209 --> 01:31:46.219 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes
 
01:31:49.729 --> 01:31:49.739 align:start position:0%

01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
is this better much better again thank
 
01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
you very much Diana Lush for the
 
01:32:17.450 --> 01:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
American Legion judges post 43.
 
01:32:20.050 --> 01:32:20.060 align:start position:0%
um just for clarification
 
01:32:24.110 --> 01:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
we were licensed fully licensed by The
 
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission starting in September
 
01:32:29.689 --> 01:32:29.699 align:start position:0%
of 2016.
 
01:32:32.450 --> 01:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
with full compliance of opening our
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
doors at 9 30 in the morning and selling
 
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
pull tab tickets it was allowed
 
01:32:41.209 --> 01:32:41.219 align:start position:0%
audited several times we were never not
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:47.570 --> 01:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily when I was going over some
 
01:32:50.450 --> 01:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
recommendations from lottery for some
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
rule changes to Lucky Sevens in the fall
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
of 22
 
01:32:57.410 --> 01:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
I discovered
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
the new language saying that pull tabs
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
cannot be sold prior to noon time when
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with a bingo event so I
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
contacted lottery I said but we've been
 
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
licensed since 2016 and selling tickets
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
so it kind of caused a little bit of a
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
stir ultimately it was discovered that a
 
01:33:22.090 --> 01:33:22.100 align:start position:0%
bill was presented in 2018
 
01:33:25.370 --> 01:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
well past the two years I was licensed
 
01:33:28.610 --> 01:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
and currently licensed it got changed
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
to Newt
 
01:33:33.770 --> 01:33:33.780 align:start position:0%
this little history as to how why I
 
01:33:36.649 --> 01:33:36.659 align:start position:0%
think there was it was a mistake is what
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
I've been told so we're just here to
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
right the wrong this has severely
 
01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:45.780 align:start position:0%
impacted my Saturday morning Bingo for
 
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
the American veterans of the Judas post
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
we still open at 9 30. people still are
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
there waiting at the door because it is
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
a social event as you've heard but we
 
01:33:58.970 --> 01:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
cannot sell those tickets until noon but
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
our Bingo is done and over with pretty
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
much by two o'clock
 
01:34:06.410 --> 01:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
ticket sales we don't sell past a
 
01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:08.219 align:start position:0%
certain time because we need to balance
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
the funds I have several Financial
 
01:34:13.370 --> 01:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
reports to complete for the Lottery
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
Commission and obviously I need to
 
01:34:18.110 --> 01:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
balance that so we've been stricken down
 
01:34:20.030 --> 01:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
to about an hour to an hour and 15
 
01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
minutes of sale time for our pull tabs
 
01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
which is really the backbone of our
 
01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:25.910 align:start position:0%
which is really the backbone of our
Revenue

01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:34:28.669 --> 01:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
Saturday mornings we have lost since
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
October because we had to stop because
 
01:34:33.370 --> 01:34:33.380 align:start position:0%
this was the law on the books now
 
01:34:37.729 --> 01:34:37.739 align:start position:0%
and those about six months roughly 2500
 
01:34:41.570 --> 01:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
to 3 000 every Saturday
 
01:34:45.530 --> 01:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
so and that's affecting our veterans
 
01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:47.750 align:start position:0%
so and that's affecting our veterans
directly

01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
directly
 
01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:49.310 align:start position:0%
directly
um

01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:51.410 --> 01:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
Mike was correct
 
01:34:54.590 --> 01:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
we do sell the majority of our pull tab
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
tickets Our Lucky Seven tickets prior to
 
01:34:59.629 --> 01:34:59.639 align:start position:0%
the start of our game our game starts at
 
01:35:01.450 --> 01:35:01.460 align:start position:0%
11 30 A.M
 
01:35:05.570 --> 01:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
so people can dab it's it's obviously
 
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
very hard to open pull tab tickets
 
01:35:10.610 --> 01:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
manually and dub at the same time so
 
01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
this is why the people do like to
 
01:35:13.970 --> 01:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
purchase their tickets in advance of the
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
Bingo starting we do still sell while
 
01:35:18.490 --> 01:35:18.500 align:start position:0%
the games are being
 
01:35:21.290 --> 01:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
conducted and then at our intermission
 
01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
about halfway through and then that's
 
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
pretty much where they stop so our our
 
01:35:28.010 --> 01:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream like I said has been
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
severely affected and nobody can explain
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
why the bill was passed in 2018
 
01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
especially to affect a licensed charity
 
01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%

of love for the homeless which started
 
01:36:17.570 --> 01:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
out much like we said boxes of love for
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
the homeless and we've expanded over the
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
five years to serve our seniors living
 
01:36:24.649 --> 01:36:24.659 align:start position:0%
in poverty through subsidized housing we
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
throw days of caring for our rural
 
01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
homeless who don't have access to
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
Services because they're not centrally
 
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
located in a large city or metropolitan
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
area and we also do inner city Outreach
 
01:36:39.050 --> 01:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
as well as supporting through our Joshua
 
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
Project other Charities that are helping
 
01:36:43.070 --> 01:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
people close the gap between
 
01:36:47.209 --> 01:36:47.219 align:start position:0%
homelessness and housing so we do quite
 
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
a bit we're very small charity we have
 
01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
two employees and we currently have one
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
Bingo day which is Sunday and since you
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned it it is a very much a senior
 
01:37:00.350 --> 01:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
day we love our Sundays and all of our
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
seniors but for us just like with
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
teacher's post there's been a
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
significant impact to our Revenue as a
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
result of the reduction in ticket sale
 
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
hours so we open the hall or our game
 
01:37:16.189 --> 01:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
start at 11 and we were allowed to sell
 
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
Lucky Sevens up until our game started
 
01:37:21.229 --> 01:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
at one now we can only sell them for an
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
hour which has had a huge impact on the
 
01:37:26.810 --> 01:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
number of deals we're able to do and if
 
01:37:29.149 --> 01:37:29.159 align:start position:0%
if I might just add one other thing if
 
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
that's okay with the committee we talked
 
01:37:33.110 --> 01:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
about you know all these Charities who
 
01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
are sort of waiting to get in I think
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand how
 
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
complicated the process is and how much
 
01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
is required of an executive director and
 
01:37:44.689 --> 01:37:44.699 align:start position:0%
the and their team in order to run a
 
01:37:47.450 --> 01:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
bingo so you know a lot of small
 
01:37:49.850 --> 01:37:49.860 align:start position:0%
Charities are shy away from it because
 
01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
it's you know the licensing is the
 
01:37:53.930 --> 01:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the charity
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
understanding the financials or the
 
01:37:57.770 --> 01:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the charity making
 
01:37:59.689 --> 01:37:59.699 align:start position:0%
sure everything is you know we're a lily
 
01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
bite organization we don't have any big
 
01:38:05.450 --> 01:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
salaries and so it's it's really
 
01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
important to understand that this
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily attract the little
 
01:38:12.290 --> 01:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
guys I think we're talking about
 
01:38:16.010 --> 01:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
big big rooms so thank you any questions
 
01:38:18.649 --> 01:38:18.659 align:start position:0%
for me
 
01:38:21.770 --> 01:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much for coming
 
01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
and for everything you do thank you okay
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
I do not have any more pink cards for
 
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 192. yes would you like to
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:41.689 --> 01:38:41.699 align:start position:0%
please give us your official title I'm
 
01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
not sure and I don't want to mess it up
 
01:38:45.050 --> 01:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you hi good morning my name is
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
Valerie King I work for New Hampshire
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
lottery I oversee the division that
 
01:38:51.470 --> 01:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
oversees charitable gaming I believe our
 
01:38:53.090 --> 01:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
current name is enforcement and
 
01:38:56.169 --> 01:38:56.179 align:start position:0%
compliance I just wanted to
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
clarify some information that was
 
01:39:01.370 --> 01:39:01.380 align:start position:0%
provided and then offer to answer any
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have
 
01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.669 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have
um

01:39:04.669 --> 01:39:04.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:09.169 --> 01:39:09.179 align:start position:0%
so the hours were set in rules at least
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
as far back as 2015 I believe
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
so and at that time it was always the
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
the times that um
 
01:39:22.129 --> 01:39:22.139 align:start position:0%
the the noon time hours for when it's in
 
01:39:24.169 --> 01:39:24.179 align:start position:0%
conjunction with bingo so that has been
 
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
in place since at least 2015 they put it
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
into the statute I believe in 2018 but
 
01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
it has been there for a significant
 
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
amount of time
 
01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to clarify that because
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
there was some indication that it was
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
allowed at one time to go as early as
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
eight but as far as I can tell from our
 
01:39:46.970 --> 01:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
records that's not true at least from
 
01:39:53.149 --> 01:39:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:55.250 --> 01:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
is it Deputy Commissioner I'm not sure
 
01:39:56.930 --> 01:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
your title I'm a division director
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
division director any questions for the
 
01:40:00.290 --> 01:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
division director yes representative
 
01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:02.270 align:start position:0%
division director yes representative
Platt

01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
Platt
 
01:40:04.490 --> 01:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
have you are you a pining on the bill
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
one way or the other no okay I just
 
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify some information that
 
01:40:09.410 --> 01:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
was provided
 
01:40:11.450 --> 01:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you so much I think it would be
 
01:40:12.649 --> 01:40:12.659 align:start position:0%
appropriate to still have you fill out a
 
01:40:13.970 --> 01:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
pink card if you wouldn't mind okay
 
01:40:16.490 --> 01:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
great okay guys that's all I have for
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 192. so with that we'll
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing and take a
 
01:40:23.209 --> 01:40:23.219 align:start position:0%
break until one o'clock we will
 
01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
reconvene and we have two more Bill
 
01:40:36.890 --> 01:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:48.709 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.719 --> 01:40:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
ings

01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:52.920 --> 02:36:30.290 align:start position:0%
 
sentence

02:36:30.290 --> 02:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:34.130 --> 02:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
hey the time being 105 five
 
02:36:39.469 --> 02:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:44.570 --> 02:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
and first up we have Senator Tim Lang
 
02:36:45.830 --> 02:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you community members thank you
 
02:36:47.630 --> 02:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
for having me back as I introduce Senate
 
02:36:50.750 --> 02:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 17 again I'm Senator Tim Lang uh
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
representing District 2 which is General
 
02:36:56.150 --> 02:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
the Lakes Region area this proposal in
 
02:36:57.410 --> 02:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
front of you would allow that any
 
02:36:59.210 --> 02:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
donations received by fish and game
 
02:37:02.030 --> 02:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
department for the non-game species fund
 
02:37:06.050 --> 02:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
as established in RSA 212-b colon six to
 
02:37:08.090 --> 02:37:08.100 align:start position:0%
be exempt from requiring approval of the
 
02:37:09.290 --> 02:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game Commission and the
 
02:37:11.210 --> 02:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
governor and executive Council
 
02:37:13.010 --> 02:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
in the same manner that any funds the
 
02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
department receives from non-profit
 
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
organizations are exempt from such
 
02:37:20.090 --> 02:37:20.100 align:start position:0%
approval under RSA 206 colon 33-c
 
02:37:21.650 --> 02:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
currently any monies that are received
 
02:37:23.150 --> 02:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
from the fund are deposit into an
 
02:37:25.309 --> 02:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
account that is overseen by the state
 
02:37:27.530 --> 02:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
treasurer and then transferred to fish
 
02:37:29.450 --> 02:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
and game department undergovers and
 
02:37:31.429 --> 02:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
authority and to Governor's Authority
 
02:37:33.349 --> 02:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
for the express purpose of managing
 
02:37:35.630 --> 02:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
non-game species programs
 
02:37:38.210 --> 02:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
the existing requirement for GNC
 
02:37:40.490 --> 02:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
approval in order to even accept such
 
02:37:42.230 --> 02:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
donations adds another administrative
 
02:37:44.030 --> 02:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
layer that slows down the process to
 
02:37:45.410 --> 02:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
getting the funding where it is needed
 
02:37:47.510 --> 02:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
in a timely manner the intent of this
 
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
proposal is to streamline and simplify
 
02:37:50.929 --> 02:37:50.939 align:start position:0%
the process for accepting donations to
 
02:37:52.969 --> 02:37:52.979 align:start position:0%
the program fishing game is here today
 
02:37:54.590 --> 02:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
and they can speak to the details and
 
02:37:56.929 --> 02:37:56.939 align:start position:0%
the specifics and this bill was put in
 
02:37:59.090 --> 02:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
at their requests so I'm happy to take
 
02:38:01.490 --> 02:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:04.070 --> 02:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative plett thank you
 
02:38:06.530 --> 02:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Senator why do we
 
02:38:08.690 --> 02:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
have to have approval for game fishing
 
02:38:08.700 --> 02:38:11.349 align:start position:0%
have to have approval for game fishing
funding

02:38:11.349 --> 02:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:38:14.570 --> 02:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
but what if we had game funding again
 
02:38:16.490 --> 02:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
I'll let fishing game answer that that
 
02:38:18.590 --> 02:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
we currently have a statute that creates
 
02:38:21.349 --> 02:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
that non-species game fund and so it's
 
02:38:23.270 --> 02:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
allowed anybody any citizen who makes a
 
02:38:25.550 --> 02:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
donation into that fund we'd be able to
 
02:38:27.530 --> 02:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
bypass some of the red tape and get the
 
02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
money into the fund so the department
 
02:38:30.770 --> 02:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
can expend it to the for the purposes
 
02:38:34.730 --> 02:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:37.610 --> 02:38:37.620 align:start position:0%
yes representative Army
 
02:38:38.990 --> 02:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:38:43.490 --> 02:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh by Disclosure I give to this fund and
 
02:38:46.550 --> 02:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
I think it's been 14 years I think they
 
02:38:49.250 --> 02:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
told me last time
 
02:38:51.889 --> 02:38:51.899 align:start position:0%
um and I am kind of appalled that it
 
02:38:54.410 --> 02:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
goes through governor and Council I had
 
02:38:56.750 --> 02:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
no idea
 
02:38:58.370 --> 02:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
a lot of people don't and again it's
 
02:38:59.929 --> 02:38:59.939 align:start position:0%
just it's an administrative red tape I
 
02:39:01.130 --> 02:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
think we can do away with here at the
 
02:39:03.610 --> 02:39:03.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:10.790 --> 02:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
oh representative orrs thank you Mr
 
02:39:12.950 --> 02:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
chair Tim thanks for taking my question
 
02:39:15.349 --> 02:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang
 
02:39:17.450 --> 02:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
the do you know why it was set up
 
02:39:19.130 --> 02:39:19.140 align:start position:0%
originally why it was structured that
 
02:39:21.950 --> 02:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
way any idea
 
02:39:23.870 --> 02:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
I do not I was in the legislature back
 
02:39:25.309 --> 02:39:25.319 align:start position:0%
then so I don't know I know originally
 
02:39:28.070 --> 02:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
most the standing practice has been for
 
02:39:29.690 --> 02:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
donations generally go through the
 
02:39:31.309 --> 02:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
executive Council but in a specific
 
02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
instance there are other exemptions and
 
02:39:36.170 --> 02:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
I I understand in law this would just be
 
02:39:37.849 --> 02:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
adding to that exemption to bypass that
 
02:39:39.770 --> 02:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
red tape because it has a designated
 
02:39:41.809 --> 02:39:41.819 align:start position:0%
purpose it's not a general fund kind of
 
02:39:43.790 --> 02:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
donation okay yeah I'm surprised there
 
02:39:46.010 --> 02:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
isn't like a fund for whatever the Loon
 
02:39:48.950 --> 02:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
fund or maybe representative Omni knows
 
02:39:52.190 --> 02:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
but I'm just surprised a donation that's
 
02:39:54.530 --> 02:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
going to help Wildlife has to go through
 
02:39:58.010 --> 02:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
fish and game and there's not a separate
 
02:40:00.370 --> 02:40:00.380 align:start position:0%
a loon fund or whatever the money's for
 
02:40:03.230 --> 02:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
I'd be interested to know if ret bomb he
 
02:40:04.849 --> 02:40:04.859 align:start position:0%
wants to share what that was for so
 
02:40:06.950 --> 02:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sure
 
02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative almi I'd be willing to
 
02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
share it if I'm allowed to but this is a
 
02:40:16.190 --> 02:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:18.290 --> 02:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
that's a good point it's a great
 
02:40:19.670 --> 02:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
question from fish and game was coming
 
02:40:20.750 --> 02:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
up next
 
02:40:23.450 --> 02:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
all right yes we can we can discuss that
 
02:40:27.469 --> 02:40:27.479 align:start position:0%
later anything else any other questions
 
02:40:33.710 --> 02:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:37.429 --> 02:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
next up we have Mike marshan from Fish
 
02:40:56.630 --> 02:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:58.790 --> 02:40:58.800 align:start position:0%

02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:12.429 align:start position:0%
I'm here in support of Senate Bill 17.
uh

02:41:12.429 --> 02:41:12.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:41:14.030 --> 02:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
representing the fish and game
 
02:41:15.050 --> 02:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
department and the Fish and Game
 
02:41:15.060 --> 02:41:17.210 align:start position:0%
department and the Fish and Game
Commission

02:41:17.210 --> 02:41:17.220 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
02:41:18.650 --> 02:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
um so I'd like to take a few minutes
 
02:41:20.270 --> 02:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
just to talk about the non-game program
 
02:41:22.610 --> 02:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
and thank you for Senator Lang for
 
02:41:25.070 --> 02:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
introducing this
 
02:41:27.349 --> 02:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
um the legislature uh set up the
 
02:41:29.389 --> 02:41:29.399 align:start position:0%
non-game program in 1988 so we're happy
 
02:41:31.309 --> 02:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
to be celebrating our 35th Anniversary
 
02:41:32.929 --> 02:41:32.939 align:start position:0%
this year
 
02:41:34.670 --> 02:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
um and we have a pretty wide breadth
 
02:41:37.309 --> 02:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
we're actually the state uh entity
 
02:41:39.710 --> 02:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
responsible for the protection of all
 
02:41:41.389 --> 02:41:41.399 align:start position:0%
the species that aren't actively hunted
 
02:41:43.309 --> 02:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
fished or trapped for and that's
 
02:41:45.290 --> 02:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
actually 80 percent of the vertebrate
 
02:41:47.389 --> 02:41:47.399 align:start position:0%
species in the state so the birds the
 
02:41:50.090 --> 02:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
mammals uh the reptiles amphibians and
 
02:41:51.349 --> 02:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
we're also responsible for all the
 
02:41:53.090 --> 02:41:53.100 align:start position:0%
invertebrates the pollinators of our
 
02:41:55.550 --> 02:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
plants uh the the muscles that keep our
 
02:41:58.969 --> 02:41:58.979 align:start position:0%
lakes and rivers clean so a pretty wide
 
02:42:01.670 --> 02:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
um breadth of responsibility yet our
 
02:42:03.710 --> 02:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
program is pretty uniquely set up for a
 
02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
state agency we actually depend on uh
 
02:42:08.750 --> 02:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
donations and that's how it was set up
 
02:42:11.090 --> 02:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
from the start and
 
02:42:14.030 --> 02:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
um we do not receive fishing and hunting
 
02:42:17.330 --> 02:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
license Revenue as the other programs in
 
02:42:18.889 --> 02:42:18.899 align:start position:0%
the fish and game do so we really do
 
02:42:21.710 --> 02:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
depend on those donations the donations
 
02:42:23.750 --> 02:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
then go even further they help us bring
 
02:42:26.150 --> 02:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
in a additional federal grants that
 
02:42:28.070 --> 02:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
require non-federal match so they go
 
02:42:30.650 --> 02:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
that much further we think we've been a
 
02:42:32.870 --> 02:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
really successful in the 35 years that
 
02:42:34.790 --> 02:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
we've had in both keeping common species
 
02:42:36.950 --> 02:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
common as well as recovering threatening
 
02:42:39.170 --> 02:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
and endangered species educating the
 
02:42:42.590 --> 02:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
public and so on
 
02:42:45.349 --> 02:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
so uh as mentioned this is a dedicated
 
02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
account that has been established uh
 
02:42:49.130 --> 02:42:49.140 align:start position:0%
previously and we're just looking to
 
02:42:51.650 --> 02:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
streamline process and bring it in to be
 
02:42:54.349 --> 02:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
consistent with some other programs and
 
02:42:56.630 --> 02:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh where non-profit programs within the
 
02:42:56.640 --> 02:42:57.830 align:start position:0%
uh where non-profit programs within the
department

02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:43:00.469 --> 02:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
um are streamlined in a similar way uh
 
02:43:03.410 --> 02:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
to not require additional approvals
 
02:43:05.270 --> 02:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to take this opportunity to
 
02:43:08.090 --> 02:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
thank all of our generous donors to the
 
02:43:11.090 --> 02:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
program we have over 4 500 donors a year
 
02:43:12.429 --> 02:43:12.439 align:start position:0%
to the program
 
02:43:15.590 --> 02:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
so very appreciative of all those in
 
02:43:17.929 --> 02:43:17.939 align:start position:0%
sponsoring our state program again for
 
02:43:21.110 --> 02:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
Unique within state government to be run
 
02:43:24.050 --> 02:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
off of on private donations and really
 
02:43:25.969 --> 02:43:25.979 align:start position:0%
really hoping to streamline the process
 
02:43:28.490 --> 02:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
for accepting those donations and
 
02:43:30.590 --> 02:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
maximizing where that money
 
02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
um the donors money is going into the
 
02:43:35.090 --> 02:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
conservation of those species and
 
02:43:36.590 --> 02:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
finally I'll just mention
 
02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:37.250 align:start position:0%
finally I'll just mention
um

02:43:37.250 --> 02:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:40.250 --> 02:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
many of our donors are transitioning to
 
02:43:42.550 --> 02:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
annual contributions through financial
 
02:43:44.950 --> 02:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
institutions and charitable foundations
 
02:43:47.630 --> 02:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
and we've had several people Express
 
02:43:50.630 --> 02:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
concern about needing additional
 
02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:52.429 align:start position:0%
concern about needing additional
approvals

02:43:52.429 --> 02:43:52.439 align:start position:0%
approvals
 
02:43:54.530 --> 02:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
um you know as they set those up
 
02:43:57.290 --> 02:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
following their passing and and you know
 
02:43:59.210 --> 02:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
wanting their money to be guaranteed to
 
02:44:00.530 --> 02:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
go where
 
02:44:01.910 --> 02:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
um they're setting it up so in their
 
02:44:03.830 --> 02:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
will so I'd be happy to take any
 
02:44:06.050 --> 02:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
questions we're excited about the
 
02:44:07.490 --> 02:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
opportunity I appreciate the time to
 
02:44:09.770 --> 02:44:09.780 align:start position:0%

right oh
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:23.050 --> 02:44:23.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for mentioning
 
02:44:27.469 --> 02:44:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:27.479 --> 02:44:29.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:44:29.270 --> 02:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:31.610 --> 02:44:31.620 align:start position:0%
representative Platt yes thanks for
 
02:44:33.710 --> 02:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question why limit this to
 
02:44:36.410 --> 02:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
non-game funding why can't the fish and
 
02:44:38.809 --> 02:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
game receive funding for game species
 
02:44:41.150 --> 02:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
for donations
 
02:44:44.750 --> 02:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
a governor approval the non-game program
 
02:44:46.490 --> 02:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
is unique within the department where
 
02:44:48.650 --> 02:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
we're really the primary or only program
 
02:44:48.660 --> 02:44:49.849 align:start position:0%
we're really the primary or only program
that's

02:44:49.849 --> 02:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:44:51.710 --> 02:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
um solely you know really dependent on
 
02:44:53.090 --> 02:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
those donations whereas the other game
 
02:44:54.650 --> 02:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
programs have hunting and fishing
 
02:44:57.410 --> 02:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
license revenues that really fund the
 
02:44:59.210 --> 02:44:59.220 align:start position:0%
vast majority of that non-federal match
 
02:45:01.730 --> 02:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
so they can take in donations
 
02:45:02.750 --> 02:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
um but then they go through the
 
02:45:04.790 --> 02:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
commission and um and if they exceed a
 
02:45:05.570 --> 02:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
certain amount they go through
 
02:45:08.690 --> 02:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
government Council approval
 
02:45:14.570 --> 02:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:17.150 --> 02:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
that's the way it was set up when you
 
02:45:17.160 --> 02:45:19.090 align:start position:0%
that's the way it was set up when you
know

02:45:19.090 --> 02:45:19.100 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:45:21.230 --> 02:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
that's the way I was set up in statute
 
02:45:22.969 --> 02:45:22.979 align:start position:0%
for the legislature so if you have a
 
02:45:22.979 --> 02:45:24.469 align:start position:0%
for the legislature so if you have a
question

02:45:24.469 --> 02:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:45:24.479 --> 02:45:25.849 align:start position:0%
question
um any

02:45:25.849 --> 02:45:25.859 align:start position:0%
um any
 
02:45:28.070 --> 02:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions representative
 
02:45:31.610 --> 02:45:31.620 align:start position:0%
orrs uh thank you Mr chair I think are
 
02:45:34.070 --> 02:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
you still the chair now or what anyways
 
02:45:37.070 --> 02:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
my question is how much money in the not
 
02:45:40.550 --> 02:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
of this non-game funds that you receive
 
02:45:43.190 --> 02:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
goes to uh taking care of the wolf
 
02:45:47.270 --> 02:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:49.429 --> 02:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
um zero
 
02:45:49.439 --> 02:45:51.410 align:start position:0%
um zero
so

02:45:51.410 --> 02:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:45:53.630 --> 02:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up questions
 
02:45:56.090 --> 02:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
follow-up do we have a wealth population
 
02:45:58.910 --> 02:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
02:46:02.510 --> 02:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:02.520 --> 02:46:04.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:46:04.309 --> 02:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:05.990 --> 02:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
I would defer to our fur Bearer
 
02:46:08.469 --> 02:46:08.479 align:start position:0%
biologists to answer that but there's no
 
02:46:11.510 --> 02:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
is he or she here no give it your best
 
02:46:13.010 --> 02:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
shot all right
 
02:46:15.469 --> 02:46:15.479 align:start position:0%
um there are no documented uh
 
02:46:18.830 --> 02:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
wolf populations in New Hampshire to my
 
02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:20.389 align:start position:0%
wolf populations in New Hampshire to my
knowledge

02:46:20.389 --> 02:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
02:46:20.399 --> 02:46:21.170 align:start position:0%
knowledge
um

02:46:21.170 --> 02:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:23.870 --> 02:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
there's a there's an interesting genetic
 
02:46:26.690 --> 02:46:26.700 align:start position:0%
history of between wolves and coyotes
 
02:46:29.570 --> 02:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
and domestic dogs that Pat Tate or fur
 
02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
bear biologists would be able to provide
 
02:46:33.050 --> 02:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
more information on
 
02:46:33.060 --> 02:46:33.830 align:start position:0%
more information on
um

02:46:33.830 --> 02:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:37.130 --> 02:46:37.140 align:start position:0%
but I guess the bottom line is no we
 
02:46:39.050 --> 02:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
don't have we don't there's no active
 
02:46:40.910 --> 02:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
work with Wolves they're not known to
 
02:46:42.590 --> 02:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
occur here so from in terms of the
 
02:46:44.330 --> 02:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
non-game program
 
02:46:45.950 --> 02:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
um we don't dedicate any resources to
 
02:46:47.270 --> 02:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
the species
 
02:46:49.370 --> 02:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
thank you you did better than the last
 
02:46:51.290 --> 02:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
person from fish and game I asked that
 
02:46:53.929 --> 02:46:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:57.410 --> 02:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
okay any uh representative fellows
 
02:47:01.210 --> 02:47:01.220 align:start position:0%
um it is my understanding correct that
 
02:47:05.630 --> 02:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
this bill has nothing to do with how the
 
02:47:07.610 --> 02:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
money is spent
 
02:47:11.210 --> 02:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
that it's just a question of
 
02:47:13.969 --> 02:47:13.979 align:start position:0%
when the money when contributions are
 
02:47:16.670 --> 02:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
made to this fund which is one of the
 
02:47:19.429 --> 02:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
contributions I make every year
 
02:47:23.150 --> 02:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
um when that is done instead of every
 
02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
month or so your agency having to go to
 
02:47:29.270 --> 02:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know fiscal or geotnc whatever
 
02:47:31.130 --> 02:47:31.140 align:start position:0%
instead of you having to do that
 
02:47:33.670 --> 02:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
activity every month to get approval
 
02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
before you can you know book those funds
 
02:47:41.690 --> 02:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
as Revenue coming into you that this
 
02:47:43.670 --> 02:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
bill will mean you just don't you won't
 
02:47:45.590 --> 02:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
have to go through that step you'll just
 
02:47:47.210 --> 02:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
collect the money and you'll just
 
02:47:50.630 --> 02:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
deposit it into that fund which is used
 
02:47:50.640 --> 02:47:52.090 align:start position:0%
deposit it into that fund which is used
specifically

02:47:52.090 --> 02:47:52.100 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:47:52.100 --> 02:47:53.770 align:start position:0%
specifically
for

02:47:53.770 --> 02:47:53.780 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:47:57.410 --> 02:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
non-game you know to protect the
 
02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know the butterfly The Blue Heron
 
02:48:03.530 --> 02:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
Karen butterfly and a lot some
 
02:48:05.929 --> 02:48:05.939 align:start position:0%
endangered birds and that sort of thing
 
02:48:07.790 --> 02:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
02:48:10.370 --> 02:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your support and all of
 
02:48:11.929 --> 02:48:11.939 align:start position:0%
what you said is correct yes none of
 
02:48:13.490 --> 02:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
this is on the expenditure side we would
 
02:48:15.830 --> 02:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
follow All State procedures on that we
 
02:48:16.790 --> 02:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
would have to go through on the
 
02:48:19.070 --> 02:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
expenditure side this is simply to
 
02:48:21.170 --> 02:48:21.180 align:start position:0%
simplify the process
 
02:48:23.510 --> 02:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
um and bisect that what can take several
 
02:48:25.370 --> 02:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
months to go through both the Fish and
 
02:48:26.809 --> 02:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
Game Commission and then the government
 
02:48:31.250 --> 02:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:34.910 --> 02:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
do we have any other questions uh yes
 
02:48:37.130 --> 02:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
02:48:41.570 --> 02:48:41.580 align:start position:0%
I may have other questions later on but
 
02:48:43.130 --> 02:48:43.140 align:start position:0%
so when you
 
02:48:46.250 --> 02:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
when something is expended
 
02:48:48.110 --> 02:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
from this fund
 
02:48:49.550 --> 02:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
you have
 
02:48:52.370 --> 02:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
a complete control of that you don't
 
02:48:54.050 --> 02:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
have to go through another process with
 
02:48:58.010 --> 02:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
anybody else to to spend that money
 
02:48:59.630 --> 02:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
and I have follow-up
 
02:49:01.670 --> 02:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
so our budget is part of the approved
 
02:49:03.349 --> 02:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
budget process that goes through the
 
02:49:05.990 --> 02:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's approved by this to the standard
 
02:49:08.750 --> 02:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
state budget so all of our
 
02:49:11.809 --> 02:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
you know class lines are within their
 
02:49:14.389 --> 02:49:14.399 align:start position:0%
um like any other program we have a
 
02:49:16.250 --> 02:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
dedicated account
 
02:49:18.050 --> 02:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
um if and then we follow State
 
02:49:19.610 --> 02:49:19.620 align:start position:0%
procedures with all those so if you're
 
02:49:22.130 --> 02:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
Contracting work out over a certain
 
02:49:23.270 --> 02:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
amount that would go to government
 
02:49:25.610 --> 02:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
Council for approval uh if you're
 
02:49:27.770 --> 02:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
Contracting other workout that would go
 
02:49:30.590 --> 02:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
through other Contracting processes so
 
02:49:33.410 --> 02:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
essentially would follow all the um you
 
02:49:35.330 --> 02:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
know the procedures that the rest of the
 
02:49:37.969 --> 02:49:37.979 align:start position:0%
department would follow up
 
02:49:42.230 --> 02:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
follow up so did I understand that money
 
02:49:43.969 --> 02:49:43.979 align:start position:0%
in this can be used to for matching
 
02:49:47.150 --> 02:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
grants and to collect other other grants
 
02:49:48.650 --> 02:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
to come in
 
02:49:51.230 --> 02:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
is that did I hear that or I'm making
 
02:49:53.750 --> 02:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
that up yeah so the the way that the
 
02:49:55.849 --> 02:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
non-game program was established was
 
02:49:55.859 --> 02:49:56.929 align:start position:0%
non-game program was established was
that

02:49:56.929 --> 02:49:56.939 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:49:59.450 --> 02:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
um if we were successful in raising
 
02:50:01.490 --> 02:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
private donations the state general fund
 
02:50:03.230 --> 02:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
would contribute a matching one to one
 
02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:04.490 align:start position:0%
would contribute a matching one to one
dollar

02:50:04.490 --> 02:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
02:50:06.530 --> 02:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
um up to fifty thousand dollars when the
 
02:50:07.969 --> 02:50:07.979 align:start position:0%
program was established and then that
 
02:50:09.650 --> 02:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
was up to a hundred thousand dollars I
 
02:50:11.690 --> 02:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
think in 2017.
 
02:50:13.969 --> 02:50:13.979 align:start position:0%
um and then both of those sources can be
 
02:50:16.969 --> 02:50:16.979 align:start position:0%
used to match uh federal funds our
 
02:50:18.830 --> 02:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
primary federal funds are from the U.S
 
02:50:20.750 --> 02:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
fish and wildlife service state wildlife
 
02:50:23.570 --> 02:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
grants which um mirror our purpose
 
02:50:26.570 --> 02:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
within the program and they require a 35
 
02:50:26.580 --> 02:50:28.070 align:start position:0%
within the program and they require a 35
match

02:50:28.070 --> 02:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
match
 
02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:29.150 align:start position:0%
match
um

02:50:29.150 --> 02:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:32.990 --> 02:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you follow up so
 
02:50:34.849 --> 02:50:34.859 align:start position:0%
you you
 
02:50:36.830 --> 02:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
alerted me that when you said the state
 
02:50:38.990 --> 02:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
state general fund but you can match
 
02:50:42.950 --> 02:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
federal or any other uh private uh
 
02:50:45.410 --> 02:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
Foundation money and all that sort of
 
02:50:48.170 --> 02:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
thing with with the money with this use
 
02:50:50.809 --> 02:50:50.819 align:start position:0%
this as a match
 
02:50:53.630 --> 02:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
I mean use the use this and to get a
 
02:50:56.710 --> 02:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
match okay from any other source
 
02:51:00.370 --> 02:51:00.380 align:start position:0%
non-profit or state or federal uh if if
 
02:51:03.410 --> 02:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
public I suppose right if it's eligible
 
02:51:05.750 --> 02:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
for that Source usually for us it's the
 
02:51:08.150 --> 02:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
federal a Federal grant that requires a
 
02:51:11.210 --> 02:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
certain matching percentage thank you
 
02:51:14.450 --> 02:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
anybody have anything else
 
02:51:17.570 --> 02:51:17.580 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none thank you very much
 
02:51:19.610 --> 02:51:19.620 align:start position:0%
I don't have any more pink cards is
 
02:51:21.410 --> 02:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who would like to uh
 
02:51:25.370 --> 02:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:27.650 --> 02:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
okay seeing that I'll close the hearing
 
02:51:37.750 --> 02:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:41.809 --> 02:51:41.819 align:start position:0%
what happened to The Fish and Game funds
 
02:51:44.630 --> 02:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
all right and I was here when they were
 
02:51:50.590 --> 02:51:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:53.809 --> 02:51:53.819 align:start position:0%
I guess we have 10 minutes until
 
02:51:53.819 --> 02:51:55.429 align:start position:0%
I guess we have 10 minutes until
the

02:51:55.429 --> 02:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:51:55.439 --> 02:51:58.849 align:start position:0%
the
okay

02:51:58.849 --> 02:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:01.870 --> 02:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
the next hearing will start at 1 30.
 
03:01:48.710 --> 03:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:51.950 --> 03:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon the time being 1 30 we
 
03:01:53.450 --> 03:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
will now open the public hearing on
 
03:01:55.910 --> 03:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 191 and we will recognize
 
03:01:58.490 --> 03:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
the Senator David Waters welcome home
 
03:02:00.110 --> 03:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
03:02:01.610 --> 03:02:01.620 align:start position:0%
committee Senator David Waters District
 
03:02:04.969 --> 03:02:04.979 align:start position:0%
4 to introduce Senate Bill 191 relative
 
03:02:07.250 --> 03:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
to road toll registration surg charges
 
03:02:11.330 --> 03:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
for electric uh vehicles and um what the
 
03:02:13.849 --> 03:02:13.859 align:start position:0%
bill does uh and I guess I would prefer
 
03:02:15.469 --> 03:02:15.479 align:start position:0%
to call it kind of the fair share bill
 
03:02:17.630 --> 03:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
pay your fair share bill
 
03:02:20.090 --> 03:02:20.100 align:start position:0%
um what it does in recognizing that
 
03:02:22.010 --> 03:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
we're going to see potentially declining
 
03:02:25.190 --> 03:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
road toll revenues because of fewer and
 
03:02:27.290 --> 03:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
fewer vehicles that are going to be gas
 
03:02:30.650 --> 03:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
powered that we have to find a way to
 
03:02:32.870 --> 03:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are feeding the road
 
03:02:34.370 --> 03:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
toll and that the folk folks with
 
03:02:36.170 --> 03:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles are paying their fair
 
03:02:38.510 --> 03:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
share to do to do that
 
03:02:40.130 --> 03:02:40.140 align:start position:0%
um so what the bill does
 
03:02:42.490 --> 03:02:42.500 align:start position:0%
is it assesses a hundred dollar
 
03:02:45.710 --> 03:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
surcharge on annual registration for
 
03:02:49.969 --> 03:02:49.979 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids uh
 
03:02:51.050 --> 03:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
and then this will go into the highway
 
03:02:54.349 --> 03:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
fund just like it's gas tax and then
 
03:02:56.150 --> 03:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
there's a provision here that 20 percent
 
03:02:59.150 --> 03:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
of that may go to helping continue to
 
03:03:02.809 --> 03:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
build out the EV charging system which
 
03:03:04.309 --> 03:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
is something we need to do and this
 
03:03:05.990 --> 03:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
would provide a revenue Source stream
 
03:03:09.290 --> 03:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
for that on that particular regard I
 
03:03:11.990 --> 03:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
decided not to make that mandatory or to
 
03:03:13.990 --> 03:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
put in an appropriation
 
03:03:16.370 --> 03:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Transportation to
 
03:03:18.110 --> 03:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
do that because I thought that that
 
03:03:19.870 --> 03:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
should be a judgment of future
 
03:03:22.490 --> 03:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
legislatures or particularly of joint
 
03:03:24.349 --> 03:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal that if the department wants to
 
03:03:26.090 --> 03:03:26.100 align:start position:0%
come forward and say we we've got some
 
03:03:28.010 --> 03:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
money we've got some projects can we use
 
03:03:30.349 --> 03:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
this funding for that I I think the
 
03:03:32.030 --> 03:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
legislature should get to weigh in at
 
03:03:34.070 --> 03:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
that point on that so that's why the
 
03:03:38.269 --> 03:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
bill is developed this way
 
03:03:40.309 --> 03:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
now let me kind of talk a little bit
 
03:03:42.769 --> 03:03:42.779 align:start position:0%
more about the context for
 
03:03:44.150 --> 03:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:03:46.190 --> 03:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
um I've mentioned the road toll issues
 
03:03:47.990 --> 03:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
that are just starting to emerge now
 
03:03:49.790 --> 03:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
right now we only got about one percent
 
03:03:52.250 --> 03:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
or so of the vehicles in New Hampshire
 
03:03:55.130 --> 03:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
are electric vehicles
 
03:03:58.969 --> 03:03:58.979 align:start position:0%
um but it's increasing very rapidly
 
03:04:01.370 --> 03:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
um last quarter of 2022 six percent of
 
03:04:04.849 --> 03:04:04.859 align:start position:0%
all vehicles sold were electric and the
 
03:04:06.950 --> 03:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
projections are for New Hampshire and I
 
03:04:07.730 --> 03:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
think this is maybe a little
 
03:04:09.530 --> 03:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
conservative we'll probably see sixty
 
03:04:13.370 --> 03:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
thousand Vehicles by 2030 in this state
 
03:04:15.950 --> 03:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
and as you know that most of the major
 
03:04:18.410 --> 03:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
automobile companies have announced the
 
03:04:20.210 --> 03:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
date by which they're not going to be
 
03:04:23.750 --> 03:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
making uh gas powered cars anymore for
 
03:04:27.950 --> 03:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
some it's 20 30 for some is 20 30 35 and
 
03:04:30.050 --> 03:04:30.060 align:start position:0%
so that's the way the the manufacturers
 
03:04:32.809 --> 03:04:32.819 align:start position:0%
in the in the market are are going and
 
03:04:34.370 --> 03:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
it'll be about 100 new models are coming
 
03:04:36.170 --> 03:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
out in the next year or so
 
03:04:37.790 --> 03:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
um a lot of a lot of much more
 
03:04:40.010 --> 03:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
inexpensive cars so this you know this
 
03:04:41.030 --> 03:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
is changing and I think New Hampshire
 
03:04:43.910 --> 03:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be ready to make sure that um
 
03:04:47.030 --> 03:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
we are prepared to make sure we can
 
03:04:51.429 --> 03:04:51.439 align:start position:0%
still uh fund our transportation system
 
03:04:54.050 --> 03:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
now there are a lot of options well you
 
03:04:56.150 --> 03:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
know everybody recognizes the issue what
 
03:04:57.590 --> 03:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
are we going to do about declining gas
 
03:05:00.469 --> 03:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
tax revenues in all the states been some
 
03:05:02.450 --> 03:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
other approaches taken
 
03:05:03.889 --> 03:05:03.899 align:start position:0%
um you may remember there's been a lot
 
03:05:05.870 --> 03:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
of discussion in the house about vehicle
 
03:05:08.570 --> 03:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
miles traveled over the years as a
 
03:05:10.490 --> 03:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
method there is a pilot program out in
 
03:05:13.670 --> 03:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
Oregon about that and um you know it
 
03:05:16.610 --> 03:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
just so let me yet seemed to find the
 
03:05:18.290 --> 03:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
magic of how to actually make that work
 
03:05:20.870 --> 03:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
and one thing about that is if you do a
 
03:05:22.610 --> 03:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
vehicle miles travel then you don't
 
03:05:24.230 --> 03:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
capture anybody
 
03:05:25.849 --> 03:05:25.859 align:start position:0%
um you know who's coming in from out of
 
03:05:27.650 --> 03:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
state who you used to be able to get
 
03:05:29.150 --> 03:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
their road toll because they're filling
 
03:05:30.590 --> 03:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
up the gas station but if it's vehicle
 
03:05:31.849 --> 03:05:31.859 align:start position:0%
miles traveled how do you figure out
 
03:05:33.590 --> 03:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
what state they're in or
 
03:05:35.870 --> 03:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
somebody commutes from Massachusetts and
 
03:05:37.490 --> 03:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
spent half their amount disputes to
 
03:05:39.110 --> 03:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts half their mileages down
 
03:05:40.429 --> 03:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
there how do you apportion that out
 
03:05:43.010 --> 03:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
without so interfering with people's
 
03:05:45.230 --> 03:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
privacy through software to figure out
 
03:05:47.690 --> 03:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
where you're driving and when so I'm not
 
03:05:50.090 --> 03:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
sure that that's going to work um but
 
03:05:52.790 --> 03:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
now quite a few states have gone
 
03:05:54.469 --> 03:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
um towards about a dozen states that
 
03:05:56.690 --> 03:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
have gone towards this model
 
03:05:59.750 --> 03:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
um Wyoming goes up to 250 dollars which
 
03:06:01.490 --> 03:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
is I don't know how they came up with
 
03:06:04.849 --> 03:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
that but most of them are 25 to 150
 
03:06:09.290 --> 03:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
um now uh this bill in our Senate weighs
 
03:06:11.990 --> 03:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
and means um Senator Innis
 
03:06:13.429 --> 03:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
um said look let's if we're going to do
 
03:06:15.290 --> 03:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
this let's let's do it
 
03:06:19.070 --> 03:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
the right way which meant calculate the
 
03:06:21.170 --> 03:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
average miles traveled by a New
 
03:06:23.809 --> 03:06:23.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire motorist
 
03:06:27.469 --> 03:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
um about uh 12 500 Miles figure that
 
03:06:31.790 --> 03:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
they are getting 25 miles to the gallon
 
03:06:34.730 --> 03:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
and then the 22 22 cents which is the
 
03:06:37.550 --> 03:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
gas tax the state tax you come up with
 
03:06:40.490 --> 03:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
about 105 dollars
 
03:06:42.469 --> 03:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
um so 100 is a nice round figure and
 
03:06:44.450 --> 03:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
it's a logic to it too this is what you
 
03:06:46.370 --> 03:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
would have would be spending if you were
 
03:06:48.349 --> 03:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
driving a gas car and that's what you're
 
03:06:50.630 --> 03:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
contributing to the road toll so 100
 
03:06:52.910 --> 03:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
kind of makes sense now when this is
 
03:06:54.950 --> 03:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
done in Senate ways it means
 
03:06:57.650 --> 03:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
um attention was not paid to the issue
 
03:06:59.870 --> 03:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
the plug-in hybrids I think a hundred
 
03:07:02.450 --> 03:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
dollars is not exactly fair for them uh
 
03:07:04.370 --> 03:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
plug-in hybrid maybe about half of what
 
03:07:07.670 --> 03:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
they do is going to be using gas so um I
 
03:07:09.230 --> 03:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
think there's you know some suggestion
 
03:07:11.090 --> 03:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
maybe we ought to maybe we want to do 50
 
03:07:13.190 --> 03:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
for that and again it's fairness and I
 
03:07:15.590 --> 03:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
do think that that would make uh make
 
03:07:18.349 --> 03:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
some some sense so that's the that's the
 
03:07:22.910 --> 03:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
math but um uh behind it and um
 
03:07:24.650 --> 03:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
you know just in the other part of the
 
03:07:26.630 --> 03:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
context is other efforts that are
 
03:07:28.250 --> 03:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
underway to figure out how to get at
 
03:07:31.849 --> 03:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
this issue and um I know the Senate has
 
03:07:34.750 --> 03:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
in Senate Transportation House Bill 422
 
03:07:38.510 --> 03:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
which is looking to re-establish the
 
03:07:40.969 --> 03:07:40.979 align:start position:0%
committee that had been looking at what
 
03:07:42.590 --> 03:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
to do about the road toll and about
 
03:07:45.710 --> 03:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles we're likely to pass
 
03:07:48.050 --> 03:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
that uh I don't think there's any
 
03:07:50.030 --> 03:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
conflict between getting that committee
 
03:07:51.710 --> 03:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
going again of course we have a
 
03:07:54.050 --> 03:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
transportation Council which when we
 
03:07:55.730 --> 03:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
folded up the commission on electric
 
03:07:58.490 --> 03:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
vehicle infrastructure a few years ago
 
03:08:00.349 --> 03:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
after made its report and we put some
 
03:08:02.870 --> 03:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
things in legislation at that point
 
03:08:05.929 --> 03:08:05.939 align:start position:0%
um you know we handed some of the duties
 
03:08:07.490 --> 03:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
over electric vehicle infrastructure
 
03:08:09.590 --> 03:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
over to the transportation Council and
 
03:08:11.150 --> 03:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
they're doing some things too
 
03:08:12.769 --> 03:08:12.779 align:start position:0%
to think that what needs to be looked at
 
03:08:15.590 --> 03:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
in the future and will be Beyond this
 
03:08:20.150 --> 03:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
approach is ideas about maybe putting a
 
03:08:22.309 --> 03:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
surcharge on the electricity that goes
 
03:08:24.230 --> 03:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
out of a charging station on the
 
03:08:25.969 --> 03:08:25.979 align:start position:0%
highways and that way if they have the
 
03:08:27.950 --> 03:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate metering
 
03:08:29.750 --> 03:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
you could kind of figure out well how
 
03:08:31.309 --> 03:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
much of that juice
 
03:08:32.929 --> 03:08:32.939 align:start position:0%
ought to you to charge and you get the
 
03:08:35.450 --> 03:08:35.460 align:start position:0%
out-of-staters that way most chargings
 
03:08:36.910 --> 03:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
can be done at home
 
03:08:40.130 --> 03:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
so uh you know you're not really going
 
03:08:41.630 --> 03:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
to get homeowners to put in the
 
03:08:43.790 --> 03:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
expensive meters to figure that out so
 
03:08:46.070 --> 03:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that I think there will be
 
03:08:47.210 --> 03:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
other things in the future we'll do
 
03:08:50.030 --> 03:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
about that but that's why I think House
 
03:08:51.950 --> 03:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 442 makes sense we'll study that
 
03:08:53.990 --> 03:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
come up with some new ideas
 
03:08:57.110 --> 03:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
but this we can do now it's fair it's
 
03:08:58.910 --> 03:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
paying your fair share
 
03:09:00.530 --> 03:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
and I'll just say another couple words
 
03:09:02.389 --> 03:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
Madam chair if I may about
 
03:09:05.330 --> 03:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
um the EV charging infrastructure we
 
03:09:06.650 --> 03:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
have about four and a half million
 
03:09:09.110 --> 03:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
dollars from the VW settlement and those
 
03:09:11.090 --> 03:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
contracts are now going out they're
 
03:09:13.370 --> 03:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
almost all out to help build up a fast
 
03:09:16.250 --> 03:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
charge system on our interstates and our
 
03:09:19.610 --> 03:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
our major non-interstate uh highways as
 
03:09:21.410 --> 03:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
as well and those contracts are going
 
03:09:23.570 --> 03:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
out they're going to use that that money
 
03:09:25.730 --> 03:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
up I'll remind the committee that the
 
03:09:27.469 --> 03:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
governor we got the Volkswagen
 
03:09:29.750 --> 03:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
settlement determined as he could that
 
03:09:32.389 --> 03:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
he wanted the maximum to go that could
 
03:09:34.670 --> 03:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
go from that settlement into charging
 
03:09:36.889 --> 03:09:36.899 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and that was that was a
 
03:09:39.710 --> 03:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
smart move from the governor we also now
 
03:09:42.710 --> 03:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
have 17.1 million dollars of Navy funds
 
03:09:44.389 --> 03:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
from the federal government for charging
 
03:09:47.950 --> 03:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
that uh we put in our application to the
 
03:09:50.330 --> 03:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
feds as that came out of the
 
03:09:52.610 --> 03:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
transportation bill that passed and uh
 
03:09:54.410 --> 03:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
our grant proposal was accepted we're
 
03:09:56.929 --> 03:09:56.939 align:start position:0%
getting a 17.1 million to continue
 
03:09:59.990 --> 03:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
building out EV charging
 
03:10:01.730 --> 03:10:01.740 align:start position:0%
um but you know and that's so important
 
03:10:03.530 --> 03:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
for tourism you know we're kind of known
 
03:10:05.510 --> 03:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
as a donor hole in New England now and
 
03:10:07.370 --> 03:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
the tourists are worried about being
 
03:10:09.349 --> 03:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
able to charge and then come up here
 
03:10:10.550 --> 03:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
um so this is going to take care of a
 
03:10:12.170 --> 03:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
lot of that but not all of it so having
 
03:10:13.730 --> 03:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
a continuing
 
03:10:16.490 --> 03:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
um fund so that we might be able to um
 
03:10:18.050 --> 03:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
at the discretion of legislature in the
 
03:10:19.910 --> 03:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
future put some more money into the
 
03:10:21.710 --> 03:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
charging infrastructure
 
03:10:23.269 --> 03:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
um that that's probably a good way to go
 
03:10:25.550 --> 03:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
on that so I hope I've given enough of
 
03:10:27.410 --> 03:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
the big picture and then the particular
 
03:10:29.510 --> 03:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
details of the bill and got to take any
 
03:10:29.520 --> 03:10:30.950 align:start position:0%
details of the bill and got to take any
questions

03:10:30.950 --> 03:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:10:32.570 --> 03:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator that was wonderful any
 
03:10:34.790 --> 03:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Schamberg
 
03:10:36.910 --> 03:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Senator
 
03:10:40.070 --> 03:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
where did you say the 17.1 million is
 
03:10:42.170 --> 03:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
coming from that's in the that was in
 
03:10:43.190 --> 03:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
the federal thanks for the question is
 
03:10:44.510 --> 03:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
that in the Federal Transportation Bill
 
03:10:46.670 --> 03:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
Federal Transit thank you very much it's
 
03:10:49.370 --> 03:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
called a navi program Navi and you have
 
03:10:51.349 --> 03:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
to put in a proposal to get the amount
 
03:10:53.690 --> 03:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
the portion to your state there is more
 
03:10:55.610 --> 03:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
money for charging infrastructure that
 
03:10:58.429 --> 03:10:58.439 align:start position:0%
is going to be on a grant basis and um
 
03:10:59.870 --> 03:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
you know we'll certainly be applying for
 
03:11:01.910 --> 03:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
more but that's that's the way the
 
03:11:05.170 --> 03:11:05.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:07.190 --> 03:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative Susan Almy and then
 
03:11:08.570 --> 03:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
03:11:11.170 --> 03:11:11.180 align:start position:0%
thank you on
 
03:11:13.130 --> 03:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
I read
 
03:11:15.830 --> 03:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
maybe it was even in the Senate notes
 
03:11:15.840 --> 03:11:16.969 align:start position:0%
maybe it was even in the Senate notes
but

03:11:16.969 --> 03:11:16.979 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:11:20.630 --> 03:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
um I read that there was a requirement
 
03:11:22.610 --> 03:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
by the federal government that any
 
03:11:24.349 --> 03:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
Chargers that come from the federal
 
03:11:28.190 --> 03:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
government on cannot charge for the
 
03:11:28.200 --> 03:11:29.570 align:start position:0%
government on cannot charge for the
electricity

03:11:29.570 --> 03:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
03:11:31.730 --> 03:11:31.740 align:start position:0%
how is that going to work
 
03:11:33.889 --> 03:11:33.899 align:start position:0%
who's going to pay for it thanks for the
 
03:11:35.570 --> 03:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
question and you know there is some
 
03:11:37.370 --> 03:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
regulation around that
 
03:11:41.330 --> 03:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
and um I think that that presents a kind
 
03:11:43.130 --> 03:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
of a difficulty we're going to have to
 
03:11:44.450 --> 03:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
work that out and that's why I think
 
03:11:46.730 --> 03:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
House Bill 442
 
03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
is when they that committee gets set up
 
03:11:50.630 --> 03:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
again is going to have to look at that
 
03:11:52.910 --> 03:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
and I think it is all the more reason
 
03:11:55.550 --> 03:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
why we've got to do this we can control
 
03:11:55.560 --> 03:11:56.750 align:start position:0%
why we've got to do this we can control
this

03:11:56.750 --> 03:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:11:58.490 --> 03:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
if the feds are making some regulations
 
03:12:00.469 --> 03:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
about you know their charging
 
03:12:02.809 --> 03:12:02.819 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fine but this is going to
 
03:12:04.910 --> 03:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
take care of our road toll and I think
 
03:12:06.469 --> 03:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
what's important about the road toll
 
03:12:08.389 --> 03:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
tool is that remember it's not just for
 
03:12:10.790 --> 03:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
the state highways that the percentage
 
03:12:13.070 --> 03:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
goes to our municipalities
 
03:12:14.929 --> 03:12:14.939 align:start position:0%
so this is a way of making sure our
 
03:12:17.330 --> 03:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
municipalities don't get starved for
 
03:12:19.429 --> 03:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
funding for their roads and local roads
 
03:12:20.570 --> 03:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
and bridges
 
03:12:22.429 --> 03:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
um because the road toll Robin is going
 
03:12:22.439 --> 03:12:23.750 align:start position:0%
um because the road toll Robin is going
down

03:12:23.750 --> 03:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
down
 
03:12:23.760 --> 03:12:26.410 align:start position:0%
down
foreign

03:12:26.410 --> 03:12:26.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:29.929 --> 03:12:29.939 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you madam chair I have two
 
03:12:32.389 --> 03:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
questions one of them I I wasn't I
 
03:12:35.510 --> 03:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
didn't uh get how many states are
 
03:12:38.389 --> 03:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
already using this kind of fee
 
03:12:40.969 --> 03:12:40.979 align:start position:0%
how many did you say yeah a dozen have
 
03:12:42.170 --> 03:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
already done it thanks for your question
 
03:12:44.389 --> 03:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have already done it okay
 
03:12:47.030 --> 03:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
um there is a chart of those I could
 
03:12:48.410 --> 03:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
have brought in copies but I you know
 
03:12:50.389 --> 03:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a chart of those
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
um of who's done what there are several
 
03:12:54.950 --> 03:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
more states that have legislation in
 
03:12:56.570 --> 03:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
process this year and I don't know where
 
03:12:58.550 --> 03:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
they're at but as of you know as of the
 
03:13:00.110 --> 03:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
end of last year
 
03:13:02.929 --> 03:13:02.939 align:start position:0%
um we had 12 and the range was 25 to 150
 
03:13:04.370 --> 03:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
most of them fell in that ranged in
 
03:13:07.250 --> 03:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
Wyoming's kind of an outlier at 250.
 
03:13:10.969 --> 03:13:10.979 align:start position:0%
okay and my other question was
 
03:13:13.309 --> 03:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
um the town clerks that collect the
 
03:13:15.950 --> 03:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
registration fee are they going to be
 
03:13:19.190 --> 03:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
doing this at the same time and do they
 
03:13:22.190 --> 03:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
get some kind of money for doing the
 
03:13:23.870 --> 03:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
processing because I didn't look at the
 
03:13:25.790 --> 03:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
whole statute I just read what the bill
 
03:13:28.550 --> 03:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
was yeah thanks for the question so
 
03:13:31.010 --> 03:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
um what the what the um
 
03:13:33.710 --> 03:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles will do either do the
 
03:13:33.720 --> 03:13:35.750 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles will do either do the
software

03:13:35.750 --> 03:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
software
 
03:13:37.010 --> 03:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
um and they've got a little money and
 
03:13:38.330 --> 03:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
get the software but it's not much
 
03:13:39.590 --> 03:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
because it's pretty easy to do because
 
03:13:42.290 --> 03:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
we're already at registration time
 
03:13:45.410 --> 03:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
because we have the VIN number the local
 
03:13:47.450 --> 03:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
clerk already knows
 
03:13:49.969 --> 03:13:49.979 align:start position:0%
you know what kind of charges there are
 
03:13:51.889 --> 03:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
that we already have for different kinds
 
03:13:53.150 --> 03:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
of fuel types
 
03:13:55.490 --> 03:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
so the local clerks will yes they'll be
 
03:13:57.469 --> 03:13:57.479 align:start position:0%
collecting this
 
03:14:00.530 --> 03:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
um but it will be seamless for them you
 
03:14:02.330 --> 03:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
know just when they put the car in to
 
03:14:04.670 --> 03:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
register it it'll pop up
 
03:14:07.070 --> 03:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
on the computer that they are subject to
 
03:14:09.290 --> 03:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
the hundred dollar fee and the check
 
03:14:11.389 --> 03:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
then that's the cost that that's what
 
03:14:13.250 --> 03:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
the person will be charged to register
 
03:14:14.210 --> 03:14:14.220 align:start position:0%
their car
 
03:14:16.550 --> 03:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it's there's no the
 
03:14:18.650 --> 03:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
physical note does not indicate any
 
03:14:20.929 --> 03:14:20.939 align:start position:0%
additional vocal expenditures for the
 
03:14:20.939 --> 03:14:24.230 align:start position:0%
additional vocal expenditures for the
clerks

03:14:24.230 --> 03:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:25.610 --> 03:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
lots of hands up
 
03:14:27.650 --> 03:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
03:14:29.330 --> 03:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:14:29.340 --> 03:14:30.230 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair thank you
Senator

03:14:30.230 --> 03:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
03:14:30.240 --> 03:14:31.190 align:start position:0%
Senator
um

03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:33.590 --> 03:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
just a couple things that I just get a
 
03:14:34.969 --> 03:14:34.979 align:start position:0%
better idea of how this is going to work
 
03:14:36.710 --> 03:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
so I've got kind of two questions in one
 
03:14:38.690 --> 03:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask them at the same time
 
03:14:41.630 --> 03:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
so uh the first thing the as you talk
 
03:14:43.190 --> 03:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
about the building out the
 
03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and using some of these
 
03:14:46.490 --> 03:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
funds and some additional funds to build
 
03:14:49.670 --> 03:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
out the the charging infrastructure I
 
03:14:52.250 --> 03:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
guess I'm not clear on is the state
 
03:14:54.349 --> 03:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
going to own these Chargers after
 
03:14:56.750 --> 03:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
they're built or are we just helping
 
03:14:59.990 --> 03:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
subsidize the construction of them
 
03:15:03.410 --> 03:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
um and and then my second question is uh
 
03:15:05.030 --> 03:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
it talks about the Department of Safety
 
03:15:06.530 --> 03:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
Division of Motor Vehicles shall
 
03:15:08.570 --> 03:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
determine necessary procedures for
 
03:15:10.490 --> 03:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
determining Vehicles subject to the
 
03:15:12.290 --> 03:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
surcharge which I think you explained
 
03:15:14.389 --> 03:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
pretty black and white um it's either
 
03:15:16.130 --> 03:15:16.140 align:start position:0%
plugs in or it doesn't
 
03:15:18.410 --> 03:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
um I didn't know if there was anything
 
03:15:22.309 --> 03:15:22.319 align:start position:0%
else in that that we we need to to we're
 
03:15:24.469 --> 03:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
not saying a test request and the second
 
03:15:25.969 --> 03:15:25.979 align:start position:0%
one first yeah this is pretty automatic
 
03:15:27.410 --> 03:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to be hearing from
 
03:15:29.750 --> 03:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
the folks about just how it works now
 
03:15:32.450 --> 03:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
but basically the VIN number will pop up
 
03:15:34.309 --> 03:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
just what you are and what you ought to
 
03:15:35.690 --> 03:15:35.700 align:start position:0%
be charged because we have differential
 
03:15:38.150 --> 03:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
charges for the type of fuel now right
 
03:15:39.950 --> 03:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
um on registration then in terms of
 
03:15:42.530 --> 03:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
ownership of of these um this is this is
 
03:15:44.809 --> 03:15:44.819 align:start position:0%
generally a grant program
 
03:15:46.190 --> 03:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
um and then we find a place that's what
 
03:15:47.929 --> 03:15:47.939 align:start position:0%
you know if you drive up 93 and you go
 
03:15:49.849 --> 03:15:49.859 align:start position:0%
to the Common Man there you I mean those
 
03:15:51.830 --> 03:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
are Teslas in there but you know the
 
03:15:54.290 --> 03:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
ones we're building it's usually um
 
03:15:57.410 --> 03:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
somebody at a rest stop or at an exit
 
03:16:00.410 --> 03:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
says we want them here
 
03:16:04.190 --> 03:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
um and uh so then the grant goes to
 
03:16:07.429 --> 03:16:07.439 align:start position:0%
provide cover those costs
 
03:16:09.889 --> 03:16:09.899 align:start position:0%
um but the ownership I'm not exactly
 
03:16:11.450 --> 03:16:11.460 align:start position:0%
sure how the ownership is at that point
 
03:16:14.090 --> 03:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
I believe that the ownership is at the
 
03:16:17.330 --> 03:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
the folks who are are you know putting
 
03:16:19.370 --> 03:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
that that are there
 
03:16:22.190 --> 03:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
um and their operation so I I think
 
03:16:23.750 --> 03:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's a handoff there but I think I
 
03:16:25.790 --> 03:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
may be corrected on that but I don't
 
03:16:27.110 --> 03:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
think the state wants to be in the
 
03:16:29.210 --> 03:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
business of owning zillions of charges
 
03:16:30.670 --> 03:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
around here and maintaining them no
 
03:16:33.769 --> 03:16:33.779 align:start position:0%
that's uh hand off
 
03:16:35.690 --> 03:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
okay I think I'll just keep going around
 
03:16:37.429 --> 03:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
the room if you don't mind other hands
 
03:16:40.610 --> 03:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:42.530 --> 03:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:16:42.540 --> 03:16:44.269 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
um

03:16:44.269 --> 03:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:48.590 --> 03:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
you set the probably a 50 roughly charge
 
03:16:51.710 --> 03:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
for hybrids would be I think you use the
 
03:16:54.650 --> 03:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
word more fair words more fair
 
03:16:56.290 --> 03:16:56.300 align:start position:0%
um are you looking to
 
03:17:00.550 --> 03:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
us to consider amending that this bill
 
03:17:03.650 --> 03:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
yeah yes thank you very much I think
 
03:17:05.210 --> 03:17:05.220 align:start position:0%
there's some interest in doing that on
 
03:17:06.650 --> 03:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
the committee yeah I'm from
 
03:17:08.510 --> 03:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative what yeah I have
 
03:17:11.950 --> 03:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:14.030 --> 03:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
glad to hear it
 
03:17:16.550 --> 03:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative Susan Olney
 
03:17:19.190 --> 03:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you on
 
03:17:22.849 --> 03:17:22.859 align:start position:0%
why not normal hybrids which I think
 
03:17:25.550 --> 03:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
they're a lot more of
 
03:17:28.670 --> 03:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
on it would be somewhat lower I think I
 
03:17:31.250 --> 03:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
think I get about
 
03:17:34.070 --> 03:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
30 to 40 percent but then I go over
 
03:17:36.830 --> 03:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
mountains in the winter
 
03:17:39.290 --> 03:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
and that brings it down
 
03:17:40.910 --> 03:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question
 
03:17:43.550 --> 03:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
um the calculation there is that if your
 
03:17:46.309 --> 03:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
plug-in you're using juice
 
03:17:49.010 --> 03:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
instead of gas and that's pretty clear
 
03:17:52.309 --> 03:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
now hybrid vehicle does it runs on gas
 
03:17:55.190 --> 03:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
but it has an electric battery pack but
 
03:17:56.809 --> 03:17:56.819 align:start position:0%
it runs on gas
 
03:17:59.690 --> 03:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
and there are some cars the darn hybrid
 
03:18:02.690 --> 03:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
that get equivalent gas mileage or even
 
03:18:04.750 --> 03:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
better than a hybrid
 
03:18:07.610 --> 03:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking we don't penalize people
 
03:18:09.410 --> 03:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
for having a fuel-efficient car and if
 
03:18:10.910 --> 03:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
it happened to be a hybrid or just be a
 
03:18:13.429 --> 03:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
very efficient gas car I I think they're
 
03:18:14.750 --> 03:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
not pulling juice
 
03:18:17.389 --> 03:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
they're paying the Roto
 
03:18:20.269 --> 03:18:20.279 align:start position:0%
so that's why that's why it's uh this
 
03:18:20.279 --> 03:18:22.790 align:start position:0%
so that's why that's why it's uh this
way

03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:22.800 --> 03:18:24.530 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:18:24.530 --> 03:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:18:26.269 --> 03:18:26.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:18:27.769 --> 03:18:27.779 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:18:31.490 --> 03:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that it's possible that um
 
03:18:33.410 --> 03:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
especially with the FED Federal funding
 
03:18:35.630 --> 03:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
that maybe some of these charges would
 
03:18:38.030 --> 03:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
put in a rest area and things like that
 
03:18:40.309 --> 03:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
as far as I know rest areas are owned by
 
03:18:42.469 --> 03:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
the state and
 
03:18:45.230 --> 03:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
um it seems like we would need to solve
 
03:18:48.110 --> 03:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
the problem of who of ownership because
 
03:18:49.610 --> 03:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
as you said the state and I agree with
 
03:18:50.990 --> 03:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
you I don't this I don't want the state
 
03:18:54.050 --> 03:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
in the business of maintaining charging
 
03:18:54.060 --> 03:18:55.330 align:start position:0%
in the business of maintaining charging
stations

03:18:55.330 --> 03:18:55.340 align:start position:0%
stations
 
03:18:59.150 --> 03:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
so it seems like we need or would do you
 
03:19:01.030 --> 03:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
agree that we might need a solution
 
03:19:03.110 --> 03:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
within this bill before it can move
 
03:19:04.730 --> 03:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
forward otherwise we're potentially
 
03:19:07.130 --> 03:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
letting a build out happen and we don't
 
03:19:09.170 --> 03:19:09.180 align:start position:0%
know who owns it and who's maintaining
 
03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
it thanks for that question you know I I
 
03:19:12.530 --> 03:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
think I misspoke a little I'm not
 
03:19:14.510 --> 03:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
talking about just you know rest stops
 
03:19:18.530 --> 03:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
on the highway you know the um on 95 and
 
03:19:23.269 --> 03:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
on 93 we actually sold those areas
 
03:19:26.030 --> 03:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
to the folks like Common Man and then on
 
03:19:28.190 --> 03:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
95 it's other business entities so that
 
03:19:29.750 --> 03:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
they could set up commercial operations
 
03:19:32.269 --> 03:19:32.279 align:start position:0%
because the state can't do that
 
03:19:34.610 --> 03:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
um the other places that are in the
 
03:19:36.769 --> 03:19:36.779 align:start position:0%
program now that are getting the funding
 
03:19:39.769 --> 03:19:39.779 align:start position:0%
is Flowing to are off the highway at an
 
03:19:42.110 --> 03:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
exit and those are commercial properties
 
03:19:44.809 --> 03:19:44.819 align:start position:0%
who want to host these for a variety of
 
03:19:46.670 --> 03:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
a variety of reasons
 
03:19:46.680 --> 03:19:47.510 align:start position:0%
a variety of reasons
um

03:19:47.510 --> 03:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:50.210 --> 03:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
and I think that you'll be hearing from
 
03:19:51.650 --> 03:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
the people who are running those
 
03:19:54.349 --> 03:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
programs that how they handle all those
 
03:19:56.690 --> 03:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
issues of construction ownership and the
 
03:19:58.790 --> 03:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
grant funding form
 
03:20:01.070 --> 03:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
I would say in this bill representative
 
03:20:05.330 --> 03:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
the court of this bill is the fair share
 
03:20:07.250 --> 03:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
if you're if you have an electric
 
03:20:10.250 --> 03:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
vehicle that you support
 
03:20:12.110 --> 03:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
the road toll
 
03:20:13.849 --> 03:20:13.859 align:start position:0%
and the highway fund
 
03:20:16.250 --> 03:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
for the state roads and for admissible
 
03:20:18.650 --> 03:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
roads and bridges if
 
03:20:21.889 --> 03:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
there is a a desire to use some of the
 
03:20:24.830 --> 03:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
funding up to 20 percent for
 
03:20:24.840 --> 03:20:26.389 align:start position:0%
funding up to 20 percent for
the

03:20:26.389 --> 03:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:20:29.570 --> 03:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
charging infrastructure we have programs
 
03:20:33.650 --> 03:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
in Des and Dot which are managing how
 
03:20:36.769 --> 03:20:36.779 align:start position:0%
that money would get used and dealing
 
03:20:39.110 --> 03:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
with all the issues you're raising
 
03:20:41.030 --> 03:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
if that happens you know what I'm saying
 
03:20:43.670 --> 03:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's not this shall it's a May here so
 
03:20:45.950 --> 03:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
um but we do have in Dot and and Des
 
03:20:48.170 --> 03:20:48.180 align:start position:0%
because of these existing programs Des
 
03:20:50.389 --> 03:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
runs the Volkswagen side of things
 
03:20:52.070 --> 03:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's the way that settlement was done
 
03:20:54.170 --> 03:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
dot is now
 
03:20:56.389 --> 03:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
um dealing with the uh the Navy funding
 
03:20:58.849 --> 03:20:58.859 align:start position:0%
so they've they've got this setup of you
 
03:21:00.830 --> 03:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
know if it goes that way and a pot of
 
03:21:02.929 --> 03:21:02.939 align:start position:0%
money might be coming out of the the the
 
03:21:07.730 --> 03:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
the uh the dot to go into that purpose I
 
03:21:09.410 --> 03:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
think they'll that that's how they deal
 
03:21:11.210 --> 03:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
with those things and that's why I don't
 
03:21:12.650 --> 03:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
think it was necessary to do them in
 
03:21:12.660 --> 03:21:13.670 align:start position:0%
think it was necessary to do them in
here

03:21:13.670 --> 03:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:21:13.680 --> 03:21:14.690 align:start position:0%
here
okay

03:21:14.690 --> 03:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:21:16.730 --> 03:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna take a turn
 
03:21:18.349 --> 03:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
here's my question I understand the
 
03:21:20.630 --> 03:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
fairness concept but is the juice worth
 
03:21:23.030 --> 03:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
the squeeze this is not raising much
 
03:21:25.370 --> 03:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
money in the grand scheme of things and
 
03:21:27.290 --> 03:21:27.300 align:start position:0%
do you think we're kind of penalizing
 
03:21:28.370 --> 03:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
people who are trying to be
 
03:21:30.889 --> 03:21:30.899 align:start position:0%
environmentally friendly by then making
 
03:21:31.969 --> 03:21:31.979 align:start position:0%
them pay this and we're not really
 
03:21:33.889 --> 03:21:33.899 align:start position:0%
actually putting a lot of money into the
 
03:21:36.170 --> 03:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
transportation fund your thoughts thanks
 
03:21:37.790 --> 03:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
for the question and um it's really
 
03:21:40.969 --> 03:21:40.979 align:start position:0%
two-part question it's not much now
 
03:21:43.370 --> 03:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
but wait a few years
 
03:21:46.969 --> 03:21:46.979 align:start position:0%
we're going to hit the point where 25 30
 
03:21:49.670 --> 03:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
then 50 percent of new car sales
 
03:21:51.650 --> 03:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
are going to be electric and eventually
 
03:21:53.990 --> 03:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to be almost 100 percent
 
03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
we're on that path
 
03:21:59.269 --> 03:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
and so now cars last a long time we're
 
03:22:00.769 --> 03:22:00.779 align:start position:0%
going to have a gas powered Fleet in the
 
03:22:03.170 --> 03:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
state for a long time
 
03:22:03.180 --> 03:22:04.730 align:start position:0%
state for a long time
but

03:22:04.730 --> 03:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:22:06.830 --> 03:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
the the transition is going to be
 
03:22:08.990 --> 03:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
underway and every year that goes by
 
03:22:10.929 --> 03:22:10.939 align:start position:0%
we're going to lose more and more
 
03:22:13.250 --> 03:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
Revenue potentially out of the out of
 
03:22:15.650 --> 03:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
the road toll so this is why you know if
 
03:22:18.469 --> 03:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
it's 800 000 the first year
 
03:22:20.150 --> 03:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
you know well that that means something
 
03:22:23.510 --> 03:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
but it's going to grow
 
03:22:25.070 --> 03:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to grow it's just looking at
 
03:22:28.610 --> 03:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
it looks like 400 000 at the 100 Mark so
 
03:22:30.130 --> 03:22:30.140 align:start position:0%
if we actually
 
03:22:31.849 --> 03:22:31.859 align:start position:0%
amend it
 
03:22:35.389 --> 03:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
oh this takes effect January 1 2024 so
 
03:22:36.889 --> 03:22:36.899 align:start position:0%
for 2024
 
03:22:36.899 --> 03:22:38.710 align:start position:0%
for 2024
yeah

03:22:38.710 --> 03:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:22:42.110 --> 03:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
okay but you see the 800 000 and then
 
03:22:43.849 --> 03:22:43.859 align:start position:0%
the 2400 and that's at the hundred
 
03:22:46.730 --> 03:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
dollar yeah and that's that just because
 
03:22:49.030 --> 03:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
um you know you got the registrations or
 
03:22:52.550 --> 03:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
people's data month of birth and so you
 
03:22:53.929 --> 03:22:53.939 align:start position:0%
know when it kicks in at this point
 
03:22:56.750 --> 03:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
given the number of them registered now
 
03:22:59.450 --> 03:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
it'll be about 800 but it's it's going
 
03:23:00.769 --> 03:23:00.779 align:start position:0%
to grow fast
 
03:23:02.030 --> 03:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
um and you did have a second part of
 
03:23:03.889 --> 03:23:03.899 align:start position:0%
your question about fairness issue for
 
03:23:05.389 --> 03:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
the people who have made a good gesture
 
03:23:07.490 --> 03:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
to get an electric vehicle now and I
 
03:23:09.530 --> 03:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
because I was always told that electric
 
03:23:11.870 --> 03:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles were more expensive up front is
 
03:23:16.450 --> 03:23:16.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:19.790 --> 03:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
it's interesting because I you know when
 
03:23:21.650 --> 03:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
um Norm major and I represent major and
 
03:23:23.570 --> 03:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
I tried to do a lot of these things over
 
03:23:26.510 --> 03:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
many years and a few years ago the
 
03:23:27.950 --> 03:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
electric car owners came in with that
 
03:23:29.269 --> 03:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
argument said wait a minute we're the
 
03:23:31.070 --> 03:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
good guys right and now you're going to
 
03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
penalize this and um that that's changed
 
03:23:36.830 --> 03:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
now this is supported there's a record
 
03:23:38.210 --> 03:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
and I think you're going to hear that
 
03:23:40.130 --> 03:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
from subsequent
 
03:23:42.290 --> 03:23:42.300 align:start position:0%
um subsequent testimony
 
03:23:43.790 --> 03:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
um here and that people do want to pay
 
03:23:47.269 --> 03:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
their fair share and let me say too
 
03:23:49.210 --> 03:23:49.220 align:start position:0%
um the price point
 
03:23:52.610 --> 03:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
of electric vehicles higher end models
 
03:23:54.650 --> 03:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
be more expensive than gas powered or
 
03:23:56.389 --> 03:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
just about crossed that threshold and
 
03:23:58.250 --> 03:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
100 new vehicles coming out to go
 
03:24:02.330 --> 03:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
automobile lower uh lower course and by
 
03:24:04.070 --> 03:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
the way
 
03:24:06.410 --> 03:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
you know today's the the 18th and the
 
03:24:08.570 --> 03:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
new lists come out of which cars get the
 
03:24:10.429 --> 03:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
7 500 dollar
 
03:24:12.830 --> 03:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
Federal rebate
 
03:24:14.809 --> 03:24:14.819 align:start position:0%
of the cost of the car
 
03:24:16.610 --> 03:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
and you're telling me the feds will give
 
03:24:18.710 --> 03:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
me the 700 and you can't kick a hundred
 
03:24:20.210 --> 03:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
dollars into New Hampshire
 
03:24:22.510 --> 03:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
well please
 
03:24:25.969 --> 03:24:25.979 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm getting beyond my rational
 
03:24:29.090 --> 03:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
discourse on the bill but that's the way
 
03:24:30.530 --> 03:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
I feel but that's good to know
 
03:24:32.510 --> 03:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry I took your
 
03:24:34.070 --> 03:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
turn go for it
 
03:24:35.929 --> 03:24:35.939 align:start position:0%
problem thank you for taking my question
 
03:24:38.030 --> 03:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
yeah the the government of this bill is
 
03:24:42.110 --> 03:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
to 100 or 50 for phevs to pay fair share
 
03:24:45.110 --> 03:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
in this though is some wording about
 
03:24:47.269 --> 03:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
supporting a build out of infrastructure
 
03:24:49.309 --> 03:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
charging infrastructure there's also
 
03:24:51.349 --> 03:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
Federal money will that discourage a
 
03:24:53.630 --> 03:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
private program of these charges I could
 
03:24:56.090 --> 03:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
see gas station being replaced with
 
03:24:58.729 --> 03:24:58.739 align:start position:0%
electric charging stations over time
 
03:25:01.250 --> 03:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question I don't think
 
03:25:03.590 --> 03:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
that we're the price point really works
 
03:25:06.889 --> 03:25:06.899 align:start position:0%
yet for the private build out and that's
 
03:25:09.469 --> 03:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
why there's the federal effort to get
 
03:25:12.710 --> 03:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
500 000 Chargers out there
 
03:25:15.950 --> 03:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
um and I I think that uh for us as a
 
03:25:17.690 --> 03:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
state in terms of policy what the
 
03:25:19.010 --> 03:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
governor and others have been committed
 
03:25:21.290 --> 03:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
to is realizing that we've got to get a
 
03:25:24.110 --> 03:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
we've got to get the basics done for the
 
03:25:26.330 --> 03:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
tourism industry and for the the Auto
 
03:25:27.950 --> 03:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
industry is really concerned because
 
03:25:29.690 --> 03:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
they want to sell these cars and by the
 
03:25:30.950 --> 03:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
way it's about the only kind of cars
 
03:25:31.790 --> 03:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
they're gonna be able to sell pretty
 
03:25:31.800 --> 03:25:32.809 align:start position:0%
they're gonna be able to sell pretty
soon

03:25:32.809 --> 03:25:32.819 align:start position:0%
soon
 
03:25:34.729 --> 03:25:34.739 align:start position:0%
um they want to be able to tell their
 
03:25:36.410 --> 03:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
customers that yeah you're going to be
 
03:25:37.790 --> 03:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
able to charge if you don't have a home
 
03:25:37.800 --> 03:25:39.349 align:start position:0%
able to charge if you don't have a home
charger

03:25:39.349 --> 03:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
charger
 
03:25:42.110 --> 03:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
um so that you know I think those
 
03:25:44.030 --> 03:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
factors are there will we get to the
 
03:25:46.370 --> 03:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
point where the charging infrastructure
 
03:25:49.010 --> 03:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
is if you know the prices come down
 
03:25:51.590 --> 03:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
sufficiently that there'll be more yeah
 
03:25:53.750 --> 03:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
we heard you know in the commission we
 
03:25:56.990 --> 03:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
had on EV infrastructure we had the um
 
03:25:59.090 --> 03:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
gas station and the uh convenience store
 
03:26:00.410 --> 03:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
owners come in and they're real
 
03:26:02.510 --> 03:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
interested in what this transition and
 
03:26:03.830 --> 03:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know they kind of like charging
 
03:26:03.840 --> 03:26:05.090 align:start position:0%
you know they kind of like charging
because

03:26:05.090 --> 03:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:26:07.010 --> 03:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
um let's say it takes 10 minutes 15
 
03:26:08.750 --> 03:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
minutes for some cars to get up to the
 
03:26:12.290 --> 03:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
uh 80 charge on a fast charge
 
03:26:13.130 --> 03:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
um well what are they going to do
 
03:26:14.090 --> 03:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
they're going to the store and buy
 
03:26:17.269 --> 03:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
something right and uh so I I think
 
03:26:19.130 --> 03:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
these are questions that
 
03:26:21.170 --> 03:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
um will will be answered over time but
 
03:26:22.809 --> 03:26:22.819 align:start position:0%
for right now
 
03:26:25.250 --> 03:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
uh this is something we can do to make
 
03:26:27.050 --> 03:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
sure we have the road toll and then if
 
03:26:28.610 --> 03:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's a good investment for
 
03:26:30.469 --> 03:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
us to put some of this money into the
 
03:26:32.750 --> 03:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
Chargers that's something that physical
 
03:26:34.729 --> 03:26:34.739 align:start position:0%
joint physical and legislature can
 
03:26:37.630 --> 03:26:37.640 align:start position:0%
decide because it's just a May here
 
03:26:39.710 --> 03:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
all right we'll keep going around this
 
03:26:42.110 --> 03:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
corner representative Bolton
 
03:26:43.910 --> 03:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Senator
 
03:26:46.610 --> 03:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
regarding the actual rollout of um you
 
03:26:49.070 --> 03:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
know should this pass and it's going to
 
03:26:50.630 --> 03:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
require the department of safety to to
 
03:26:52.729 --> 03:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
develop software that the city and town
 
03:26:55.610 --> 03:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
clerks will be utilizing is that I mean
 
03:26:57.110 --> 03:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
have the city and town clerk Association
 
03:27:00.050 --> 03:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
weighed in as far as realistically
 
03:27:03.190 --> 03:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
putting this into effect in 2024
 
03:27:05.330 --> 03:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
thanks that's why we have the date here
 
03:27:07.910 --> 03:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
to to the first of January now well
 
03:27:09.530 --> 03:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
that's what we were told that what could
 
03:27:11.570 --> 03:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
work as I said it's not it's not a
 
03:27:13.910 --> 03:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
complicated software fix it it just
 
03:27:15.530 --> 03:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
isn't but I think there will be folks
 
03:27:17.510 --> 03:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
here who can talk a bit more about that
 
03:27:19.550 --> 03:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:27:20.929 --> 03:27:20.939 align:start position:0%
other questions on this side yes
 
03:27:23.210 --> 03:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
representative lippley thank you madam
 
03:27:23.220 --> 03:27:24.229 align:start position:0%
representative lippley thank you madam
chair

03:27:24.229 --> 03:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:27:26.030 --> 03:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator
 
03:27:28.670 --> 03:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm thinking about this as a
 
03:27:31.490 --> 03:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
mom of a family and you know when I pay
 
03:27:33.530 --> 03:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
to register my car every year it's
 
03:27:36.229 --> 03:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
expensive it's like I don't know maybe
 
03:27:38.750 --> 03:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
two or three hundred bucks this if you
 
03:27:40.610 --> 03:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
add 100 bucks on top like
 
03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
that's a huge percentage increase for
 
03:27:44.809 --> 03:27:44.819 align:start position:0%
folks so I guess I'm thinking about it
 
03:27:48.110 --> 03:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
as like on like the perspective of the
 
03:27:49.849 --> 03:27:49.859 align:start position:0%
family budget
 
03:27:52.070 --> 03:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
um and I'm thinking what are you know
 
03:27:53.929 --> 03:27:53.939 align:start position:0%
when we set policy
 
03:27:56.809 --> 03:27:56.819 align:start position:0%
we usually do so to affect
 
03:27:59.570 --> 03:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh behavior that we find desirable and
 
03:28:01.389 --> 03:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
it seems like this one does the opposite
 
03:28:05.389 --> 03:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
so I'm concerned so I feel like we
 
03:28:07.010 --> 03:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to pass on the house
 
03:28:08.630 --> 03:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
side I don't know maybe you guys have
 
03:28:10.429 --> 03:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
got stuff done on the on the other side
 
03:28:14.269 --> 03:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
of the wall where we are doing anything
 
03:28:17.330 --> 03:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
to promote sale of electric vehicles in
 
03:28:19.790 --> 03:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so we're not where our
 
03:28:21.969 --> 03:28:21.979 align:start position:0%
neighbors are on this we're not
 
03:28:25.370 --> 03:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
facilitating electric vehicles in any
 
03:28:27.830 --> 03:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
way and here we are ready to impose
 
03:28:31.790 --> 03:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
attacks on folks who like maybe went to
 
03:28:33.530 --> 03:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to buy an electric vehicle
 
03:28:34.849 --> 03:28:34.859 align:start position:0%
because they couldn't find one on their
 
03:28:36.650 --> 03:28:36.660 align:start position:0%
dealer's lot
 
03:28:38.690 --> 03:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
um so it seems like we're
 
03:28:42.050 --> 03:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
I don't know why we would want to
 
03:28:45.769 --> 03:28:45.779 align:start position:0%
to tax folks who are making a choice
 
03:28:48.229 --> 03:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
that has less of an impact
 
03:28:51.410 --> 03:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
on the air and I'm thinking about on the
 
03:28:53.990 --> 03:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
roads most electric vehicles I mean
 
03:28:55.550 --> 03:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
maybe they're getting heavier and
 
03:28:58.330 --> 03:28:58.340 align:start position:0%
heavier but if we need to increase
 
03:29:00.769 --> 03:29:00.779 align:start position:0%
revenues it seems to me we could do it
 
03:29:03.050 --> 03:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
based on the weight of the car
 
03:29:06.050 --> 03:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
um rather than on the fuel it's
 
03:29:09.710 --> 03:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
um it's consuming it doesn't feel like a
 
03:29:13.610 --> 03:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
policy that is is influencing people to
 
03:29:16.010 --> 03:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
make choices that benefit Society it
 
03:29:18.170 --> 03:29:18.180 align:start position:0%
feels like the opposite and I hear you
 
03:29:20.210 --> 03:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
saying that we're just about past this
 
03:29:22.910 --> 03:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
threshold we're not right we're not
 
03:29:24.469 --> 03:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
there we're not doing anything to
 
03:29:26.750 --> 03:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
encourage people in New Hampshire to
 
03:29:29.929 --> 03:29:29.939 align:start position:0%
move this direction so I'm wondering why
 
03:29:32.389 --> 03:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
are we so why would we consider so
 
03:29:32.399 --> 03:29:33.290 align:start position:0%
are we so why would we consider so
quickly

03:29:33.290 --> 03:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
03:29:35.450 --> 03:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
taxing that choice because we need
 
03:29:38.090 --> 03:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
people to move that direction not slow
 
03:29:40.250 --> 03:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
them down I understand we need to raise
 
03:29:43.130 --> 03:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
the revenue but it seems like
 
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
um the wrong thing to be taxing and it
 
03:29:48.830 --> 03:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
seems to me like if you want I
 
03:29:51.229 --> 03:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
understand it's confusing to try and
 
03:29:52.670 --> 03:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
figure out you know how many miles
 
03:29:56.030 --> 03:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
people drive but if I don't drive a lot
 
03:29:58.610 --> 03:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
and I choose to buy an electric vehicle
 
03:29:58.620 --> 03:29:59.690 align:start position:0%
and I choose to buy an electric vehicle
I'm

03:29:59.690 --> 03:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
03:29:59.700 --> 03:30:01.130 align:start position:0%
I'm
really

03:30:01.130 --> 03:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:30:03.590 --> 03:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
um being charged a lot for that seems
 
03:30:05.690 --> 03:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
like we could we could catch this on the
 
03:30:08.750 --> 03:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
how much does your vehicle weigh and we
 
03:30:10.910 --> 03:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
could catch it on you know the total end
 
03:30:14.389 --> 03:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
we could catch it on if people do charge
 
03:30:17.809 --> 03:30:17.819 align:start position:0%
up on the road you know we could have
 
03:30:19.670 --> 03:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
represented a text for that as well
 
03:30:21.110 --> 03:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
maybe get to a question for the summer
 
03:30:23.269 --> 03:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
yeah why I heard some questions okay
 
03:30:27.769 --> 03:30:27.779 align:start position:0%
good but I I guess I'm surprised to
 
03:30:30.769 --> 03:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
to see this come forward because I don't
 
03:30:33.590 --> 03:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
see it as a package of oh well we're
 
03:30:35.570 --> 03:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
doing this to support electric vehicles
 
03:30:38.750 --> 03:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
and so then it seems fair right so I
 
03:30:40.429 --> 03:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
guess I don't see it as paying your fair
 
03:30:42.950 --> 03:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
share it feels unfair and like it
 
03:30:44.690 --> 03:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
doesn't promote Behavior we want to see
 
03:30:47.809 --> 03:30:47.819 align:start position:0%
so can you help me yeah I'll try clearly
 
03:30:49.550 --> 03:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
I'm missing something so can you help me
 
03:30:52.010 --> 03:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
get to where you are thank you thank you
 
03:30:53.750 --> 03:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
and so I said I think you're going to
 
03:30:55.610 --> 03:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
hear from um
 
03:30:58.010 --> 03:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
folks who very much are advocates for
 
03:31:00.290 --> 03:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles and have a lot to do
 
03:31:02.630 --> 03:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
with the people who have made the choice
 
03:31:05.809 --> 03:31:05.819 align:start position:0%
of buying one and the psychology of that
 
03:31:08.330 --> 03:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
and and the costs and so on
 
03:31:10.190 --> 03:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
um to answer I mean a couple questions
 
03:31:13.010 --> 03:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
there I'll try to my best to answer them
 
03:31:13.020 --> 03:31:14.090 align:start position:0%
there I'll try to my best to answer them
um

03:31:14.090 --> 03:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:17.809 --> 03:31:17.819 align:start position:0%
if you have bought one of these cars
 
03:31:19.910 --> 03:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to be saving
 
03:31:22.309 --> 03:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
about a hundred dollars a year on gas
 
03:31:22.319 --> 03:31:24.290 align:start position:0%
about a hundred dollars a year on gas
tax

03:31:24.290 --> 03:31:24.300 align:start position:0%
tax
 
03:31:26.570 --> 03:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
that's you know I mean 12 000 miles a
 
03:31:28.309 --> 03:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
year yes there are people who Drive West
 
03:31:30.110 --> 03:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
so people drive a whole lot more but
 
03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
that's the average for the for the state
 
03:31:34.729 --> 03:31:34.739 align:start position:0%
and if that's 25 gallons on an average
 
03:31:37.849 --> 03:31:37.859 align:start position:0%
you know fuel efficiency or 25 miles to
 
03:31:39.889 --> 03:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
the gallon you do you do the math and
 
03:31:39.899 --> 03:31:40.849 align:start position:0%
the gallon you do you do the math and
you

03:31:40.849 --> 03:31:40.859 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:31:43.490 --> 03:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
22 for the state gas tax and it's a
 
03:31:44.570 --> 03:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
03:31:46.550 --> 03:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
so you're saving
 
03:31:49.849 --> 03:31:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:51.530 --> 03:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
um on the gas
 
03:31:53.510 --> 03:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
and and you still want to be able to
 
03:31:55.550 --> 03:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
drive on some roads that aren't full of
 
03:31:57.410 --> 03:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
potholes right and you want to go across
 
03:31:59.570 --> 03:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
bridges that are are safe because you're
 
03:32:01.250 --> 03:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
driving a car
 
03:32:02.870 --> 03:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that the fairness
 
03:32:05.269 --> 03:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
argument really does does work and I
 
03:32:06.530 --> 03:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
don't think it does anything to really
 
03:32:08.570 --> 03:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
discourage folks as I said you're
 
03:32:11.630 --> 03:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
getting a 7 or 500 rebate to buy one of
 
03:32:12.769 --> 03:32:12.779 align:start position:0%
these things
 
03:32:15.110 --> 03:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
um you're saving money from the get-go
 
03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
you're also saving a lot of money on
 
03:32:18.830 --> 03:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
repair on one of these vehicles a lot of
 
03:32:21.349 --> 03:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
money because it's just very little you
 
03:32:23.210 --> 03:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
replace the tires and a few other things
 
03:32:25.429 --> 03:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
that are not not much else you have to
 
03:32:26.870 --> 03:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
repair one of these vehicles so the cost
 
03:32:28.429 --> 03:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
of ownership over the lifetime of the
 
03:32:30.110 --> 03:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
car is way down as well so there's a lot
 
03:32:31.849 --> 03:32:31.859 align:start position:0%
of financial
 
03:32:33.469 --> 03:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
Parts on that
 
03:32:33.479 --> 03:32:34.010 align:start position:0%
Parts on that
um

03:32:34.010 --> 03:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:36.830 --> 03:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
and uh you know in terms of the the
 
03:32:38.990 --> 03:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
fairness I mean I will say it is Senator
 
03:32:40.870 --> 03:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
Ennis so you cannot find a more
 
03:32:43.550 --> 03:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
conservative person and you know there
 
03:32:45.650 --> 03:32:45.660 align:start position:0%
we are in ways and means and this came
 
03:32:47.269 --> 03:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
through unanimously that committee with
 
03:32:50.090 --> 03:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
his amendment to do it this way and you
 
03:32:52.370 --> 03:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
know she's the Senate so I mean look I
 
03:32:54.410 --> 03:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
don't like charging fees either I don't
 
03:32:55.790 --> 03:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
like taxes either I mean you heard it
 
03:32:58.190 --> 03:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
from Democrat okay
 
03:33:00.290 --> 03:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
um but I I do I I've been on
 
03:33:02.150 --> 03:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
Transportation since I've been in the
 
03:33:04.370 --> 03:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
Senate you know and we have to we have
 
03:33:08.210 --> 03:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
we have struggled to fund our roads
 
03:33:10.250 --> 03:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
and now we're facing this this
 
03:33:13.190 --> 03:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
transitional time and it is coming it is
 
03:33:14.750 --> 03:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
coming you know the dealers in New
 
03:33:16.729 --> 03:33:16.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are selling these vehicles
 
03:33:18.170 --> 03:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
um and it's coming it's going to be
 
03:33:20.210 --> 03:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
faster and faster in terms of the weight
 
03:33:22.490 --> 03:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
argument we already do have weight
 
03:33:24.410 --> 03:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
differentials for classes of vehicles
 
03:33:26.929 --> 03:33:26.939 align:start position:0%
but Passenger cars
 
03:33:29.150 --> 03:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
um you know yes some of these vehicles
 
03:33:31.070 --> 03:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
are are heavier
 
03:33:33.830 --> 03:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
but with the reduction in the weight of
 
03:33:36.530 --> 03:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
battery packs uh and the cost of
 
03:33:37.849 --> 03:33:37.859 align:start position:0%
vehicles you know there's going to be
 
03:33:39.349 --> 03:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
several Vehicles there are some now
 
03:33:40.610 --> 03:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
under thirty thousand dollars there's
 
03:33:41.870 --> 03:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
gonna be a whole lot of these vehicles
 
03:33:43.969 --> 03:33:43.979 align:start position:0%
under thirty thousand dollars there are
 
03:33:45.950 --> 03:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
Imports that are at twelve thousand
 
03:33:47.570 --> 03:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
dollars for an electric vehicle five
 
03:33:50.750 --> 03:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
seater with um with a with a 200 mile
 
03:33:52.670 --> 03:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
range you know I mean there's gonna be a
 
03:33:54.170 --> 03:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
lot of lower cost ones that they don't
 
03:33:56.630 --> 03:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
wait as way as much so I'm not sure we
 
03:33:58.429 --> 03:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
can catch it that way we do that with
 
03:33:59.990 --> 03:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
truck sound passenger vehicles but I
 
03:34:02.269 --> 03:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
don't I don't I guess I don't see an
 
03:34:04.550 --> 03:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
alternative then
 
03:34:07.070 --> 03:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
doing it this way and I don't I don't
 
03:34:08.510 --> 03:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
think I answer your questions because I
 
03:34:10.910 --> 03:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
mean I I share them you know but I think
 
03:34:13.550 --> 03:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
that's the the practicality of this
 
03:34:16.010 --> 03:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
policy and doing it this way I think can
 
03:34:17.510 --> 03:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
be called a fairness
 
03:34:18.950 --> 03:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
and I just gently would like to remind
 
03:34:20.630 --> 03:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
committee members that in a public
 
03:34:22.550 --> 03:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
hearing situation we're not here to
 
03:34:25.490 --> 03:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
debate yeah and we're here to ask
 
03:34:27.530 --> 03:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
factual questions on why they chose to
 
03:34:29.269 --> 03:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
do certain things in their bills so I
 
03:34:31.010 --> 03:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for accommodating us and I do
 
03:34:32.269 --> 03:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
think we will have I know there are
 
03:34:33.889 --> 03:34:33.899 align:start position:0%
other pink cards and there are folks who
 
03:34:36.349 --> 03:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
yes and we can certainly offline have
 
03:34:38.030 --> 03:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
many more conversations about this or we
 
03:34:39.349 --> 03:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
can certainly schedule a work session
 
03:34:40.910 --> 03:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
and maybe you could participate in that
 
03:34:42.769 --> 03:34:42.779 align:start position:0%
thank you again for your accommodation
 
03:34:45.830 --> 03:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
question okay we have other hands though
 
03:34:47.750 --> 03:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
so let me address some other people and
 
03:34:48.410 --> 03:34:48.420 align:start position:0%
then we'll come back to you
 
03:34:49.969 --> 03:34:49.979 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury
 
03:34:52.790 --> 03:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair without implying
 
03:34:54.710 --> 03:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
that I'm endorsing this approach I'm
 
03:34:56.809 --> 03:34:56.819 align:start position:0%
wondering whether you would support the
 
03:35:00.469 --> 03:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
idea of abandoning the gas tax on all
 
03:35:00.479 --> 03:35:01.729 align:start position:0%
idea of abandoning the gas tax on all
cars

03:35:01.729 --> 03:35:01.739 align:start position:0%
cars
 
03:35:04.190 --> 03:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
and amending this bill to apply a one
 
03:35:05.870 --> 03:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar surcharge to the
 
03:35:07.790 --> 03:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
registration of all vehicles regardless
 
03:35:11.150 --> 03:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
of whether the what their fuel is
 
03:35:13.070 --> 03:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
well thanks for your question and you
 
03:35:14.990 --> 03:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
know I I think we're going to face that
 
03:35:17.630 --> 03:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
kind of issue in the kind of larger
 
03:35:19.190 --> 03:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
existential question about what do we do
 
03:35:21.530 --> 03:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
about the gas tax at some point in time
 
03:35:23.750 --> 03:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's a big question
 
03:35:27.050 --> 03:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh and um part of that question is that
 
03:35:29.450 --> 03:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
and why we can't really do it now is
 
03:35:31.250 --> 03:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
that you know if you live over my area
 
03:35:33.349 --> 03:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
and you see the the cars that go through
 
03:35:35.750 --> 03:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
the toll booths and over about half of
 
03:35:37.429 --> 03:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
out of state plates
 
03:35:39.349 --> 03:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
they're buying gas here
 
03:35:41.870 --> 03:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
if we right now got rid of the gas tax
 
03:35:44.990 --> 03:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
we would not pick up any of that that
 
03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:46.309 align:start position:0%
we would not pick up any of that that
Revenue

03:35:46.309 --> 03:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
03:35:48.710 --> 03:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
um and so that's why I suggested with
 
03:35:50.630 --> 03:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
442 there's going to be ways to think
 
03:35:53.690 --> 03:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
about you know is there a transition
 
03:35:53.700 --> 03:35:55.130 align:start position:0%
about you know is there a transition
Point

03:35:55.130 --> 03:35:55.140 align:start position:0%
Point
 
03:35:56.990 --> 03:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
um where the larger picture and this is
 
03:35:58.630 --> 03:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
what you know representative major
 
03:36:01.130 --> 03:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
thought about this in a sense you know
 
03:36:02.929 --> 03:36:02.939 align:start position:0%
when he had his very exquisitely
 
03:36:05.750 --> 03:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
detailed thing about differential
 
03:36:08.090 --> 03:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
vehicle miles traveled and this would
 
03:36:09.650 --> 03:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
get at lots of different things and
 
03:36:10.969 --> 03:36:10.979 align:start position:0%
there might have been a way to capture
 
03:36:13.010 --> 03:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
the out of state but
 
03:36:15.050 --> 03:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
um we couldn't get there whereas this is
 
03:36:16.790 --> 03:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
the kind of low-hanging fruit that we
 
03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
can we can solve a problem now and I
 
03:36:21.229 --> 03:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
think for really the foreseeable future
 
03:36:23.690 --> 03:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
by taking this approach and then have
 
03:36:25.130 --> 03:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
you know deal with the much bigger ones
 
03:36:27.290 --> 03:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
you know 10 15 years from now when we
 
03:36:28.910 --> 03:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
really are
 
03:36:30.650 --> 03:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
kind of really getting Beyond these
 
03:36:33.469 --> 03:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
vehicles and and gas powered vehicles
 
03:36:35.150 --> 03:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing you're talking about I
 
03:36:36.530 --> 03:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
mean I've thought about it you know like
 
03:36:38.389 --> 03:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
well could we do a full replace at some
 
03:36:40.010 --> 03:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
point and we'll probably have to but I
 
03:36:42.410 --> 03:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
don't I don't see a way now for that
 
03:36:45.530 --> 03:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
well thanks for the question follow-up
 
03:36:48.530 --> 03:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
so if if I would stipulate with you that
 
03:36:51.349 --> 03:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh the out of uh State driver is a
 
03:36:54.530 --> 03:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
serious uh problem
 
03:36:54.540 --> 03:36:55.450 align:start position:0%
serious uh problem
um

03:36:55.450 --> 03:36:55.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:58.070 --> 03:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
then this approach to dealing with the
 
03:37:02.330 --> 03:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:04.490 --> 03:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
um it it's a textual question I think
 
03:37:06.410 --> 03:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
that it could in time but I think these
 
03:37:10.849 --> 03:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
are policy issues that are so complex
 
03:37:13.910 --> 03:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
that it's going to take a lot of work
 
03:37:15.830 --> 03:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
in the legislature and also look into
 
03:37:17.990 --> 03:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
other states I I'm looking at other
 
03:37:20.210 --> 03:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
states all the time and I as I said I
 
03:37:21.769 --> 03:37:21.779 align:start position:0%
don't see anybody who's found a better
 
03:37:23.990 --> 03:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
way to go at this point in time than
 
03:37:26.510 --> 03:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
this this approach
 
03:37:28.010 --> 03:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
all right I saw some more hands on this
 
03:37:30.050 --> 03:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
side of the room representative orrs
 
03:37:32.030 --> 03:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Senator
 
03:37:34.670 --> 03:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
so first of all I thought the hybrid
 
03:37:36.769 --> 03:37:36.779 align:start position:0%
vehicles like the Prius
 
03:37:40.429 --> 03:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
charge their batteries by themselves
 
03:37:42.110 --> 03:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
is that true
 
03:37:43.969 --> 03:37:43.979 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks a question and they're not
 
03:37:46.550 --> 03:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
in this bill it's plugins and then
 
03:37:49.010 --> 03:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
plug-in hybrids the Prius is not a
 
03:37:51.830 --> 03:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
plug-in vehicle it's using gas to
 
03:37:53.510 --> 03:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
generate the electricity in the vehicle
 
03:37:55.490 --> 03:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
and they're using gas so they're not in
 
03:37:57.830 --> 03:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
this bill okay so that's that shows you
 
03:37:59.929 --> 03:37:59.939 align:start position:0%
how little I knew I thought all hybrids
 
03:37:59.939 --> 03:38:01.550 align:start position:0%
how little I knew I thought all hybrids
were

03:38:01.550 --> 03:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
were
 
03:38:05.030 --> 03:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
gas the gas was gener powering the
 
03:38:06.830 --> 03:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
batteries back up recharging the battery
 
03:38:08.750 --> 03:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
tell you what and I you could come out
 
03:38:11.090 --> 03:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
and see my car it's a plug-in hybrid it
 
03:38:15.410 --> 03:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
gets about 40 miles 45 miles on a charge
 
03:38:18.590 --> 03:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
and after that charge is done uh then
 
03:38:20.510 --> 03:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
the gas engine kicks in
 
03:38:23.210 --> 03:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
like a regular hybrid and get I run on
 
03:38:25.309 --> 03:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
gas to charge up the battery to run the
 
03:38:28.910 --> 03:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
car great yeah plug-in there's no no gas
 
03:38:31.429 --> 03:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
at all it's just it's all electric okay
 
03:38:33.050 --> 03:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
very good I might need a ride home so
 
03:38:35.809 --> 03:38:35.819 align:start position:0%
I'm going to follow you uh if my
 
03:38:38.750 --> 03:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up question follow up so I just
 
03:38:41.570 --> 03:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
cons thinking about you're saying in the
 
03:38:45.110 --> 03:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
next seven years by 2030 if we have 60
 
03:38:47.469 --> 03:38:47.479 align:start position:0%
000 EVS on the road
 
03:38:49.670 --> 03:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
has anybody been looking at the
 
03:38:52.429 --> 03:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
infrastructure as in like are we gonna
 
03:38:55.190 --> 03:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
go to nuclear I know Germany's firing up
 
03:38:58.429 --> 03:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
their coal plants and there's nuclear
 
03:39:00.710 --> 03:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
fusion you know that's an idea that's
 
03:39:02.090 --> 03:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
out there so I was wondering if like you
 
03:39:04.010 --> 03:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
and representative major have or
 
03:39:06.410 --> 03:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
somebody already looking at that so
 
03:39:08.510 --> 03:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
if and when we get there this
 
03:39:10.490 --> 03:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is there because I'm
 
03:39:12.170 --> 03:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
looking at buying one of these vehicles
 
03:39:14.690 --> 03:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to know thanks for the
 
03:39:17.330 --> 03:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
question and um you know it's a it's
 
03:39:18.590 --> 03:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
actually is related to the bill and if
 
03:39:19.610 --> 03:39:19.620 align:start position:0%
we're going to have charging and we're
 
03:39:20.630 --> 03:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
going to have these vehicles are we
 
03:39:21.830 --> 03:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
going to have the juice the electricity
 
03:39:24.769 --> 03:39:24.779 align:start position:0%
form and um the utilities answer that
 
03:39:26.269 --> 03:39:26.279 align:start position:0%
with yes we are electrifying
 
03:39:27.469 --> 03:39:27.479 align:start position:0%
transportation we are going to be
 
03:39:28.910 --> 03:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
electrifying a lot of other things in
 
03:39:30.950 --> 03:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
the economy and for New England in
 
03:39:32.690 --> 03:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
particular what's going to help us get
 
03:39:34.790 --> 03:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
there is offshore wind
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
um well I'm chair of our New Hampshire
 
03:39:38.030 --> 03:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
offshore wind import development is the
 
03:39:40.610 --> 03:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
governor is all in and offshore wind 320
 
03:39:44.269 --> 03:39:44.279 align:start position:0%
3.2 gigawatts of power the auction for
 
03:39:45.710 --> 03:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
the lease areas are going to take place
 
03:39:46.910 --> 03:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
very soon
 
03:39:50.570 --> 03:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
and uh and that is good that's 3C Brooks
 
03:39:53.269 --> 03:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
and up and down the East Coast that's
 
03:39:55.130 --> 03:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
what's been developed so I I'm quite
 
03:39:56.210 --> 03:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
sure we're gonna have the power supply
 
03:39:58.070 --> 03:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
whether there'll be some small-scale
 
03:40:00.170 --> 03:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
nuclear thrown in or in or hydrogen
 
03:40:02.690 --> 03:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
generation I mean lots of things but I I
 
03:40:04.670 --> 03:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
think that the planning is underway that
 
03:40:06.349 --> 03:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
we know we know we've got to do this
 
03:40:07.370 --> 03:40:07.380 align:start position:0%
because the fleet is going to go
 
03:40:09.050 --> 03:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
electric we've got to have the charging
 
03:40:11.090 --> 03:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
we've got to have the electricity
 
03:40:12.590 --> 03:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
um and we're going to pay of the roads
 
03:40:14.750 --> 03:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
so that's what this bill does very good
 
03:40:17.030 --> 03:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:40:18.769 --> 03:40:18.779 align:start position:0%
okay we'll go back around representative
 
03:40:20.150 --> 03:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
liebly yes
 
03:40:21.290 --> 03:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:40:23.870 --> 03:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
um I just was wondering as you discuss
 
03:40:25.250 --> 03:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
the bill if you discussed other
 
03:40:27.469 --> 03:40:27.479 align:start position:0%
implications I'm thinking for I'm
 
03:40:29.450 --> 03:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
thinking of two for example I'd like to
 
03:40:32.030 --> 03:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
know if you know what kind of answers
 
03:40:32.040 --> 03:40:33.050 align:start position:0%
know if you know what kind of answers
are

03:40:33.050 --> 03:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:40:34.790 --> 03:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
you came up with when you considered
 
03:40:37.130 --> 03:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
this so I'm thinking
 
03:40:39.469 --> 03:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
um I think as my car gets older I pay
 
03:40:39.479 --> 03:40:40.250 align:start position:0%
um I think as my car gets older I pay
less

03:40:40.250 --> 03:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
less
 
03:40:42.170 --> 03:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
to register my car but it seems like
 
03:40:45.349 --> 03:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
this would be steady would it holds hold
 
03:40:46.849 --> 03:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
you know it would be a hundred dollars
 
03:40:48.830 --> 03:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
which obviously the value of a hundred
 
03:40:50.389 --> 03:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
dollars goes down over time but it would
 
03:40:52.370 --> 03:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
still mean I have to pay quite a bit
 
03:40:54.710 --> 03:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
more to register my car
 
03:40:57.830 --> 03:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
um the other part of that is I'm
 
03:40:57.840 --> 03:41:01.969 align:start position:0%
um the other part of that is I'm
thinking

03:41:01.969 --> 03:41:01.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:03.710 --> 03:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
people in my neighborhood mostly Drive
 
03:41:05.630 --> 03:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
used cars right because it's a
 
03:41:07.490 --> 03:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
working-class neighborhood and I'm
 
03:41:10.670 --> 03:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
thinking if you know as soon as you go
 
03:41:11.929 --> 03:41:11.939 align:start position:0%
to an electric car you're gonna have to
 
03:41:13.429 --> 03:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
pay a hundred bucks more every single
 
03:41:16.429 --> 03:41:16.439 align:start position:0%
year to register your car it seems to me
 
03:41:19.670 --> 03:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
like that is going to influence the used
 
03:41:22.910 --> 03:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
car market right so if part of what we
 
03:41:24.950 --> 03:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
want to do as a society is think about
 
03:41:27.830 --> 03:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
the transition and getting that
 
03:41:30.170 --> 03:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
transition you know at least not slowing
 
03:41:32.210 --> 03:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
the transition down I'm wondering if you
 
03:41:34.969 --> 03:41:34.979 align:start position:0%
discussed how
 
03:41:38.269 --> 03:41:38.279 align:start position:0%
um charging a fee like that would impact
 
03:41:41.870 --> 03:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
the used market and gas versus electric
 
03:41:44.809 --> 03:41:44.819 align:start position:0%
vehicle used Market
 
03:41:46.729 --> 03:41:46.739 align:start position:0%
well thanks for the question I'm not a
 
03:41:48.349 --> 03:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
car dealer and I know there's a lot of
 
03:41:49.309 --> 03:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
talk around
 
03:41:52.070 --> 03:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
um you know we look at the over the last
 
03:41:54.050 --> 03:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
year used car market new car market you
 
03:41:57.110 --> 03:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
know pricing and so on and so forth but
 
03:41:59.690 --> 03:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
I'll come back to this two things
 
03:42:02.389 --> 03:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
if you at some point your used car
 
03:42:03.830 --> 03:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to get another car whether
 
03:42:05.929 --> 03:42:05.939 align:start position:0%
you buy a used electric car or you buy a
 
03:42:07.309 --> 03:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
new electric car
 
03:42:08.809 --> 03:42:08.819 align:start position:0%
you're going to be saving thousands of
 
03:42:10.490 --> 03:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
dollars a year on gas
 
03:42:13.190 --> 03:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
so there's that this the calculation is
 
03:42:15.710 --> 03:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
here is on the 22 cents a gallon that
 
03:42:17.330 --> 03:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
goes to the gas tax
 
03:42:20.269 --> 03:42:20.279 align:start position:0%
gas is not 22 cents a gallon right so
 
03:42:21.650 --> 03:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
the rest of the price you're paying for
 
03:42:24.889 --> 03:42:24.899 align:start position:0%
a gallon you that you're saving that so
 
03:42:27.050 --> 03:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
the cost the cost here and and they're
 
03:42:29.269 --> 03:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
going to be more and more used cars
 
03:42:30.650 --> 03:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
um but this is what the industry and
 
03:42:34.130 --> 03:42:34.140 align:start position:0%
others are looking at but for us we have
 
03:42:36.469 --> 03:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
to worry and it's our responsibility to
 
03:42:38.090 --> 03:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
worry about how we're going to pave our
 
03:42:39.950 --> 03:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
roads and how we're going to get money
 
03:42:42.710 --> 03:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
to our municipalities and if the gas tax
 
03:42:45.290 --> 03:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
is going to go away
 
03:42:48.050 --> 03:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
what do we do well this is why I have
 
03:42:49.849 --> 03:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:42:52.010 --> 03:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
um the follow-up to that is just
 
03:42:53.750 --> 03:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
um again I guess I'm thinking about it
 
03:42:57.710 --> 03:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
from a poor folks perspective because my
 
03:42:58.790 --> 03:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
neighborhood like I said is really
 
03:43:01.250 --> 03:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
working class and
 
03:43:02.690 --> 03:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:43:05.090 --> 03:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
sure there's a you know you buy a new
 
03:43:06.830 --> 03:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
car there's a lot of benefits to that
 
03:43:06.840 --> 03:43:07.790 align:start position:0%
car there's a lot of benefits to that
that

03:43:07.790 --> 03:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:43:11.030 --> 03:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
The Upfront cost is very high so the
 
03:43:13.309 --> 03:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
secondary question is this bill doesn't
 
03:43:13.319 --> 03:43:14.870 align:start position:0%
secondary question is this bill doesn't
push

03:43:14.870 --> 03:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
push
 
03:43:17.870 --> 03:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
um the 20 for investment
 
03:43:20.809 --> 03:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
um in you know electric stations but I'm
 
03:43:23.030 --> 03:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
also thinking in my neighborhood
 
03:43:24.590 --> 03:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
um you know if you're renting an
 
03:43:27.410 --> 03:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
apartment it's very unlikely that that
 
03:43:29.210 --> 03:43:29.220 align:start position:0%
you're gonna have be able to plug in at
 
03:43:30.950 --> 03:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
home right it's very unlikely that
 
03:43:32.570 --> 03:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
you're going to be able to choose to put
 
03:43:35.269 --> 03:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
solar panels on your house so I'm
 
03:43:35.279 --> 03:43:36.290 align:start position:0%
solar panels on your house so I'm
wondering

03:43:36.290 --> 03:43:36.300 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
03:43:39.130 --> 03:43:39.140 align:start position:0%
um you know just thinking about folks
 
03:43:43.550 --> 03:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh how this structure is going to happen
 
03:43:45.349 --> 03:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
because if we're not we're not like
 
03:43:48.050 --> 03:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
definitely investing 20 in a structure
 
03:43:49.130 --> 03:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like we haven't really
 
03:43:50.450 --> 03:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
talked about what that structure is
 
03:43:52.910 --> 03:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
going to look like so as we move forward
 
03:43:55.670 --> 03:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm just wondering if if you
 
03:43:58.389 --> 03:43:58.399 align:start position:0%
know what that looks like yes
 
03:44:01.070 --> 03:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
if they live in an apartment
 
03:44:03.229 --> 03:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
um there are very extensive planning has
 
03:44:04.929 --> 03:44:04.939 align:start position:0%
been undertaken at the governor's behest
 
03:44:07.309 --> 03:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
and through the commissions that are set
 
03:44:10.070 --> 03:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
up and through des and what is required
 
03:44:11.570 --> 03:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
by the federal government for planning
 
03:44:13.910 --> 03:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
for charging infrastructure I think we
 
03:44:16.729 --> 03:44:16.739 align:start position:0%
have good plans on that yeah in terms of
 
03:44:18.950 --> 03:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
the availability of charging there are
 
03:44:20.750 --> 03:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
there are other bills in the legislature
 
03:44:22.969 --> 03:44:22.979 align:start position:0%
that are going to try to make sure that
 
03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
folks who are renters can have
 
03:44:26.870 --> 03:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to charge their uh their
 
03:44:29.269 --> 03:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
cars we have Community solar
 
03:44:31.309 --> 03:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
that has passed and been operation for a
 
03:44:32.990 --> 03:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
while which ensures that the benefits of
 
03:44:34.910 --> 03:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
low-cost solar energy are also going to
 
03:44:37.969 --> 03:44:37.979 align:start position:0%
low-income folks so I I your questions
 
03:44:39.710 --> 03:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
point to things that are really valid
 
03:44:41.030 --> 03:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
and that's why I think the legislature
 
03:44:43.849 --> 03:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay the support Senator probably did
 
03:44:49.250 --> 03:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
not expect to take this much time
 
03:44:51.530 --> 03:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
would you entertain one more question
 
03:44:53.870 --> 03:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
from our ranking member I'm here and I
 
03:44:54.889 --> 03:44:54.899 align:start position:0%
just think that the people who really
 
03:44:55.790 --> 03:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
know what they're talking about are
 
03:44:58.250 --> 03:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
behind me representative of all me did
 
03:45:00.650 --> 03:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
you have a question thank you uh it's
 
03:45:04.070 --> 03:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
about something that Sam Evans Brown uh
 
03:45:07.570 --> 03:45:07.580 align:start position:0%
said on in the Senate hearing
 
03:45:12.889 --> 03:45:12.899 align:start position:0%
on the the cost of the these Chargers
 
03:45:17.389 --> 03:45:17.399 align:start position:0%
now seem to be connected to the
 
03:45:22.190 --> 03:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
the uh pricing mechanism that costs more
 
03:45:22.200 --> 03:45:23.630 align:start position:0%
the uh pricing mechanism that costs more
when

03:45:23.630 --> 03:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
when
 
03:45:26.750 --> 03:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
when they do a large amount of charging
 
03:45:28.610 --> 03:45:28.620 align:start position:0%
in a short time
 
03:45:32.450 --> 03:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
and that is what all of the newer
 
03:45:34.910 --> 03:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
Chargers are doing is doing a lot of
 
03:45:37.670 --> 03:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
charging in a short time so that the
 
03:45:40.969 --> 03:45:40.979 align:start position:0%
already high price of electricity
 
03:45:44.630 --> 03:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
is a lot higher when you charge it
 
03:45:47.570 --> 03:45:47.580 align:start position:0%
sounds like along the highway or
 
03:45:50.330 --> 03:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
wherever you have to plug in outside of
 
03:45:52.910 --> 03:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
your own house thanks for the question
 
03:45:55.729 --> 03:45:55.739 align:start position:0%
um and I'll I'll do my best to provide
 
03:45:57.590 --> 03:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
some answers to it and I I don't know
 
03:45:59.570 --> 03:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
maybe Sam's here or not but um he was
 
03:46:01.610 --> 03:46:01.620 align:start position:0%
addressing a kind of particular issue
 
03:46:04.070 --> 03:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
about time of use charging and the
 
03:46:05.990 --> 03:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
structure there
 
03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
um when we passed some legislation a few
 
03:46:10.070 --> 03:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
years ago about EV charging
 
03:46:12.650 --> 03:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we did a lot of things in
 
03:46:15.650 --> 03:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
those bills and one of it was to direct
 
03:46:18.710 --> 03:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
the POC to open a docket on this time of
 
03:46:20.389 --> 03:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
use issue
 
03:46:25.070 --> 03:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
um so that there's a way to modulate the
 
03:46:28.250 --> 03:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
impact on the grid and demand on demands
 
03:46:30.110 --> 03:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
and then the use of demand charges so
 
03:46:32.990 --> 03:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't in some ways
 
03:46:35.269 --> 03:46:35.279 align:start position:0%
this rolling out and the puc is acting
 
03:46:36.830 --> 03:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
on that and they have actually made some
 
03:46:39.050 --> 03:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
some things on it
 
03:46:39.060 --> 03:46:39.769 align:start position:0%
some things on it
um

03:46:39.769 --> 03:46:39.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:42.170 --> 03:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
in terms of charging infrastructure you
 
03:46:44.150 --> 03:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
want fast Chargers
 
03:46:46.250 --> 03:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
on the highways because people want to
 
03:46:48.050 --> 03:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
plug in get up to 80 percent of their
 
03:46:49.610 --> 03:46:49.620 align:start position:0%
charge which might be you know getting
 
03:46:51.889 --> 03:46:51.899 align:start position:0%
back up to two or 300 miles that they
 
03:46:55.130 --> 03:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
can go on the charge in 10 15
 
03:46:57.290 --> 03:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
20 minutes I mean that time is coming
 
03:46:59.389 --> 03:46:59.399 align:start position:0%
down with new technology all the time
 
03:47:01.670 --> 03:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
but that's you need fast charges on the
 
03:47:04.969 --> 03:47:04.979 align:start position:0%
highway elsewhere level twos
 
03:47:08.690 --> 03:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
which are just they are about you can
 
03:47:10.969 --> 03:47:10.979 align:start position:0%
put in about 25 miles
 
03:47:12.590 --> 03:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
in an hour
 
03:47:15.110 --> 03:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
um that's what most people have at home
 
03:47:18.050 --> 03:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
and uh if you have just want to get a
 
03:47:19.429 --> 03:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
little a little bit of charge that's
 
03:47:20.809 --> 03:47:20.819 align:start position:0%
probably likely what you know
 
03:47:23.210 --> 03:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
campgrounds and folks who want to make
 
03:47:25.370 --> 03:47:25.380 align:start position:0%
the big investment in an expensive
 
03:47:27.650 --> 03:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
level you know the fast charge which
 
03:47:29.210 --> 03:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
would cost a lot because you've got to
 
03:47:30.290 --> 03:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
bring in the power supply and the
 
03:47:31.429 --> 03:47:31.439 align:start position:0%
Chargers themselves are more expensive
 
03:47:34.849 --> 03:47:34.859 align:start position:0%
but you can do pretty inexpensively uh
 
03:47:36.469 --> 03:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
you know the charges that are Level twos
 
03:47:39.530 --> 03:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
you can also just plug these things in
 
03:47:42.110 --> 03:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
into a socket
 
03:47:43.969 --> 03:47:43.979 align:start position:0%
and you can do that with an extension
 
03:47:43.979 --> 03:47:45.170 align:start position:0%
and you can do that with an extension
cord

03:47:45.170 --> 03:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
cord
 
03:47:47.450 --> 03:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
um it you only get if maybe five or six
 
03:47:47.460 --> 03:47:48.769 align:start position:0%
um it you only get if maybe five or six
miles

03:47:48.769 --> 03:47:48.779 align:start position:0%
miles
 
03:47:51.229 --> 03:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
per the hour to in your charge but if
 
03:47:52.729 --> 03:47:52.739 align:start position:0%
you're if the car is going to be home
 
03:47:55.550 --> 03:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
for 12 or 14 hours after work until the
 
03:47:56.809 --> 03:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
next morning
 
03:47:58.370 --> 03:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
you know you get some charging that way
 
03:48:00.590 --> 03:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
so but so representative there's a
 
03:48:02.630 --> 03:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
variety of of charging infrastructure
 
03:48:04.849 --> 03:48:04.859 align:start position:0%
and I think Sam was addressing the
 
03:48:07.790 --> 03:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
issues around the puc and the the
 
03:48:11.090 --> 03:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
charging structure for the level the
 
03:48:12.889 --> 03:48:12.899 align:start position:0%
fast charge system and that is something
 
03:48:14.809 --> 03:48:14.819 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed and I think
 
03:48:16.969 --> 03:48:16.979 align:start position:0%
that and the POC is addressing it and
 
03:48:21.769 --> 03:48:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:21.779 --> 03:48:27.849 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:48:27.849 --> 03:48:27.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:31.250 --> 03:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
obviously this is a a large complex
 
03:48:33.170 --> 03:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
policy issue
 
03:48:33.180 --> 03:48:35.690 align:start position:0%
policy issue
yeah

03:48:35.690 --> 03:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:48:35.700 --> 03:48:36.349 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

03:48:36.349 --> 03:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:38.330 --> 03:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
I'm recognizing from the New Hampshire
 
03:48:41.570 --> 03:48:41.580 align:start position:0%
D.O.T Andre Briere I hope I got that
 
03:48:47.870 --> 03:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:49.729 --> 03:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
afternoon Madam chair members of the
 
03:48:51.710 --> 03:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
committee uh Andre Brier Deputy
 
03:48:54.229 --> 03:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
Commissioner nhdot
 
03:48:54.239 --> 03:48:55.130 align:start position:0%
Commissioner nhdot
um

03:48:55.130 --> 03:48:55.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:58.370 --> 03:48:58.380 align:start position:0%
we uh we testify and support of this
 
03:49:02.150 --> 03:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
bill for all the reasons uh given by uh
 
03:49:04.510 --> 03:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
by Senator Waters
 
03:49:07.490 --> 03:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
primarily uh you know we're looking at
 
03:49:09.889 --> 03:49:09.899 align:start position:0%
this from both the perspective of the
 
03:49:11.750 --> 03:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
long-term viability of the highway fund
 
03:49:15.830 --> 03:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh of which we are the primary uh
 
03:49:19.849 --> 03:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
uh utilizer among State agencies as well
 
03:49:23.889 --> 03:49:23.899 align:start position:0%
as uh an issue of of fair contribution
 
03:49:26.750 --> 03:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
to uh the infrastructure at the
 
03:49:28.670 --> 03:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
construction and maintenance of which is
 
03:49:31.130 --> 03:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
critical uh at an economic engine in the
 
03:49:31.140 --> 03:49:32.690 align:start position:0%
critical uh at an economic engine in the
state

03:49:32.690 --> 03:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:49:35.510 --> 03:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
um and as as the senator mentioned uh
 
03:49:37.969 --> 03:49:37.979 align:start position:0%
the advocacy Community is also largely
 
03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill we view this as
 
03:49:43.190 --> 03:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
a as an all of the above approach this
 
03:49:46.190 --> 03:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
is certainly not the only way to tackle
 
03:49:49.130 --> 03:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh the uh the fairness issue and the
 
03:49:53.389 --> 03:49:53.399 align:start position:0%
long-term uh contribution of EV uh
 
03:49:56.150 --> 03:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
operators to the uh to the highway
 
03:49:58.849 --> 03:49:58.859 align:start position:0%
infrastructure the state and we do think
 
03:50:01.389 --> 03:50:01.399 align:start position:0%
it's very critical that we capture
 
03:50:05.630 --> 03:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
out-of-state drivers who are also uh a
 
03:50:08.690 --> 03:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
big user of of our state roadways there
 
03:50:10.969 --> 03:50:10.979 align:start position:0%
are different ways to do that as as was
 
03:50:13.429 --> 03:50:13.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned some states are experimenting
 
03:50:17.330 --> 03:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
but we as an nhdot are members of of
 
03:50:19.429 --> 03:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
what's called ashtoe it's it's the
 
03:50:22.670 --> 03:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
National Organization uh where all state
 
03:50:24.710 --> 03:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
dots are are represented in this
 
03:50:28.190 --> 03:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
organization there is a critical mass of
 
03:50:31.130 --> 03:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
uh of consensus that's building around
 
03:50:34.490 --> 03:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
this Approach at least starting this way
 
03:50:37.070 --> 03:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
um because it's easily implementable
 
03:50:40.070 --> 03:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's a step in the right direction uh to
 
03:50:43.610 --> 03:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
to ensure uh equity and fairness uh
 
03:50:46.790 --> 03:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
of contribution to our roadways and uh
 
03:50:49.309 --> 03:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't have some of the
 
03:50:51.229 --> 03:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
complexity around per kilowatt hour
 
03:50:54.590 --> 03:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
charges things like that that ultimately
 
03:50:56.809 --> 03:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
we think you know are going to be viable
 
03:51:00.769 --> 03:51:00.779 align:start position:0%
but but just aren't yet so uh that
 
03:51:02.870 --> 03:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
that's the uh the bulk of of the
 
03:51:05.450 --> 03:51:05.460 align:start position:0%
rationale for our support while I don't
 
03:51:06.410 --> 03:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
speak for the New Hampshire
 
03:51:08.750 --> 03:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
Transportation Council
 
03:51:10.910 --> 03:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
um the chairman Jim jalbert has
 
03:51:13.370 --> 03:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
previously uh communicated to the
 
03:51:16.010 --> 03:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
legislature uh the the transportation
 
03:51:19.309 --> 03:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
Council support for this bill as well
 
03:51:21.170 --> 03:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
and I stand by for any questions you may
 
03:51:22.550 --> 03:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
have thank you very much for your
 
03:51:24.650 --> 03:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
testimony any questions from the members
 
03:51:26.690 --> 03:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
yes Representatives Pillsbury thank you
 
03:51:30.950 --> 03:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair do you think it's viable to
 
03:51:35.750 --> 03:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
look to the the existing uh gas tax
 
03:51:39.110 --> 03:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
for an analogy if we're taxing the fuel
 
03:51:39.120 --> 03:51:40.070 align:start position:0%
for an analogy if we're taxing the fuel
source

03:51:40.070 --> 03:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
source
 
03:51:43.729 --> 03:51:43.739 align:start position:0%
right can we in some fashion and I don't
 
03:51:46.130 --> 03:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
know whether we can do enough of it
 
03:51:48.830 --> 03:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
tax the charging stations come up with
 
03:51:51.130 --> 03:51:51.140 align:start position:0%
some kind of a formulation
 
03:51:55.190 --> 03:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
that may in fact include a build out of
 
03:51:57.410 --> 03:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
a public infrastructure of charging
 
03:51:59.870 --> 03:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
stations and
 
03:52:02.690 --> 03:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
excuse me and text that yeah and I'm
 
03:52:04.969 --> 03:52:04.979 align:start position:0%
looking for comparability I'm I'm sort
 
03:52:07.969 --> 03:52:07.979 align:start position:0%
of bothered by the notion that one
 
03:52:09.889 --> 03:52:09.899 align:start position:0%
portion of the driving public is taxed
 
03:52:12.110 --> 03:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
based on fuel consumption and the other
 
03:52:14.690 --> 03:52:14.700 align:start position:0%
portion of the driving population is
 
03:52:17.210 --> 03:52:17.220 align:start position:0%
taxing an entirely different parameter
 
03:52:20.990 --> 03:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh namely a flat fee per year uh yeah I
 
03:52:22.010 --> 03:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
understood thank you for the question
 
03:52:24.469 --> 03:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
and I think uh the senator got to some
 
03:52:27.229 --> 03:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
of that this is a this is a road toll
 
03:52:30.410 --> 03:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
equivalency uh because of the
 
03:52:32.330 --> 03:52:32.340 align:start position:0%
complexities right now about charging
 
03:52:35.030 --> 03:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
like you said per kilowatt hour just
 
03:52:37.550 --> 03:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
like we charge per gallon we would not
 
03:52:41.990 --> 03:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
we as dot are in support of that long
 
03:52:43.969 --> 03:52:43.979 align:start position:0%
term as well
 
03:52:46.790 --> 03:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
um you know which approach combination
 
03:52:48.889 --> 03:52:48.899 align:start position:0%
of approaches you take different states
 
03:52:50.809 --> 03:52:50.819 align:start position:0%
are experimenting with different ways to
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
do it some states are doing both the
 
03:52:55.610 --> 03:52:55.620 align:start position:0%
problem being and I think this is where
 
03:52:58.490 --> 03:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
Sam Evans Brown's testimony is relevant
 
03:53:00.769 --> 03:53:00.779 align:start position:0%
and and perhaps this committee will get
 
03:53:02.929 --> 03:53:02.939 align:start position:0%
to hear some of that from from other
 
03:53:07.610 --> 03:53:07.620 align:start position:0%
speakers is uh home charging so home
 
03:53:09.830 --> 03:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
charging uh there's not separate
 
03:53:11.510 --> 03:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
metering on that while you could do a
 
03:53:14.510 --> 03:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hour charge on EV charging
 
03:53:17.269 --> 03:53:17.279 align:start position:0%
stations that are in public home
 
03:53:20.510 --> 03:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
charging is is difficult in that regard
 
03:53:22.429 --> 03:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
um so there's some Equity issues long
 
03:53:24.229 --> 03:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
term there's there's a lot of
 
03:53:26.990 --> 03:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
supposition that home charging may go to
 
03:53:29.330 --> 03:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
separately metered charging at some
 
03:53:32.510 --> 03:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
point it's just not there yet so uh I
 
03:53:33.889 --> 03:53:33.899 align:start position:0%
think your question is very valid one
 
03:53:36.050 --> 03:53:36.060 align:start position:0%
it's certainly one that uh all the
 
03:53:38.330 --> 03:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
states are talking about we're just not
 
03:53:41.990 --> 03:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:44.150 --> 03:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
the senator mentioned a another bill
 
03:53:46.130 --> 03:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
that has a study committee in it to
 
03:53:48.889 --> 03:53:48.899 align:start position:0%
study this exact issue are you aware
 
03:53:50.929 --> 03:53:50.939 align:start position:0%
that we'll be participating in that we
 
03:53:52.790 --> 03:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
are and we're also in support of that
 
03:53:54.710 --> 03:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
bill excellent thank you other questions
 
03:53:58.610 --> 03:53:58.620 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Army
 
03:54:02.510 --> 03:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and I don't understand why it
 
03:54:06.830 --> 03:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
takes eight months or so to set up the
 
03:54:09.530 --> 03:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
new registration forms or rather
 
03:54:11.750 --> 03:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
registration uh
 
03:54:11.760 --> 03:54:13.250 align:start position:0%
registration uh
on

03:54:13.250 --> 03:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:54:17.150 --> 03:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
data sheets that come in because you got
 
03:54:20.210 --> 03:54:20.220 align:start position:0%
through uh representative Majors efforts
 
03:54:22.250 --> 03:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
you've got a Federal grant that allowed
 
03:54:25.330 --> 03:54:25.340 align:start position:0%
you to as I remember
 
03:54:29.210 --> 03:54:29.220 align:start position:0%
attach the VN number of every car in
 
03:54:33.110 --> 03:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
this state to the license plate
 
03:54:34.550 --> 03:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am thank you for the question
 
03:54:36.889 --> 03:54:36.899 align:start position:0%
that that is not DOT that would be a
 
03:54:38.650 --> 03:54:38.660 align:start position:0%
department of safety questions
 
03:54:42.530 --> 03:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
sadly defer to them on that but assuming
 
03:54:45.290 --> 03:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
that you had that couldn't you
 
03:54:46.849 --> 03:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
all you're going to do is take the
 
03:54:51.290 --> 03:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
registration form and add yet another on
 
03:54:53.929 --> 03:54:53.939 align:start position:0%
another item to it
 
03:54:55.910 --> 03:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
right I'm sorry I can't speak to that
 
03:54:58.550 --> 03:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
that is not that's not in Dot's realm um
 
03:55:00.530 --> 03:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
departments they're doing they're doing
 
03:55:03.650 --> 03:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
the registration yes yes so it wasn't
 
03:55:05.389 --> 03:55:05.399 align:start position:0%
dot that was
 
03:55:07.670 --> 03:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
03:55:11.030 --> 03:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
hanging it up I think I saw okay other
 
03:55:11.040 --> 03:55:12.950 align:start position:0%
hanging it up I think I saw okay other
questions

03:55:12.950 --> 03:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:55:14.689 --> 03:55:14.699 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much for your
 
03:55:17.269 --> 03:55:17.279 align:start position:0%
testimony okay the chair will recognize
 
03:55:19.550 --> 03:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh Gary Abbott from associated general
 
03:55:24.410 --> 03:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:24.420 --> 03:55:26.809 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:55:26.809 --> 03:55:26.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:28.849 --> 03:55:28.859 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman committee
 
03:55:30.830 --> 03:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
members for the record my name is Gary
 
03:55:32.809 --> 03:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
Abbott I'm the Executive Vice President
 
03:55:35.689 --> 03:55:35.699 align:start position:0%
of the associated general contractors
 
03:55:37.849 --> 03:55:37.859 align:start position:0%
and I'm really here today in support of
 
03:55:39.170 --> 03:55:39.180 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:55:41.030 --> 03:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
um worked a number of years of
 
03:55:42.950 --> 03:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
Representative Noah major trying to come
 
03:55:45.250 --> 03:55:45.260 align:start position:0%
up with a road usage fee
 
03:55:47.510 --> 03:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
and if you remember there were many
 
03:55:49.729 --> 03:55:49.739 align:start position:0%
calculations whether it was on the
 
03:55:52.189 --> 03:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
average of 20 miles to the gallon and
 
03:55:54.889 --> 03:55:54.899 align:start position:0%
then how far you went and there was all
 
03:55:57.710 --> 03:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
kinds of layers to that you know we
 
03:56:00.590 --> 03:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
supported Norm's proposals but we
 
03:56:01.849 --> 03:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
recognized they were somewhat
 
03:56:05.030 --> 03:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
complicated to implement and how to put
 
03:56:06.590 --> 03:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
in and I think that's where the car
 
03:56:10.610 --> 03:56:10.620 align:start position:0%
registration and type of vehicle came in
 
03:56:12.410 --> 03:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
but what I wanted to bring forward to
 
03:56:14.929 --> 03:56:14.939 align:start position:0%
you and I think the senator did a great
 
03:56:18.590 --> 03:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
job except I've been following the just
 
03:56:22.130 --> 03:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
flat fee for around the country and I
 
03:56:24.110 --> 03:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
can tell you so what I did sitting there
 
03:56:26.570 --> 03:56:26.580 align:start position:0%
is I decided to on my phone Google it a
 
03:56:29.389 --> 03:56:29.399 align:start position:0%
little bit and I found back in 2019
 
03:56:32.689 --> 03:56:32.699 align:start position:0%
there were 19 States and they knew
 
03:56:36.050 --> 03:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
California in 2021 was going to adopt a
 
03:56:38.570 --> 03:56:38.580 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar fee I went to another
 
03:56:43.490 --> 03:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
site and they say as of July 2022 30
 
03:56:46.429 --> 03:56:46.439 align:start position:0%
states have now adopted a fee so I'm
 
03:56:48.110 --> 03:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
looking at New Hampshire we're behind
 
03:56:51.110 --> 03:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
the ball as far as adoption of this kind
 
03:56:54.349 --> 03:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
of fee as the in-between to solve the
 
03:56:57.349 --> 03:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
road usage fee or the compensate for
 
03:57:00.530 --> 03:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
what we're losing with the EVs and you
 
03:57:02.750 --> 03:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
will see like on that first one website
 
03:57:06.410 --> 03:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
was myev.com and that one took all 19
 
03:57:08.929 --> 03:57:08.939 align:start position:0%
and showed you exactly how they broke
 
03:57:12.410 --> 03:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
out you know 140 for this 75 for the
 
03:57:15.050 --> 03:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
hybrids they broke it out so I'm sure
 
03:57:16.550 --> 03:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
you guys would do it I just didn't have
 
03:57:19.910 --> 03:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
time to do chat GPT yet but I'm sure
 
03:57:21.590 --> 03:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
that would come up with some additional
 
03:57:25.429 --> 03:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
information for me but I wanted to relay
 
03:57:28.309 --> 03:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
that that trend is happening as as the
 
03:57:31.309 --> 03:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
senator spoke I knew that as we went
 
03:57:33.469 --> 03:57:33.479 align:start position:0%
into covid we were in the 20s or so
 
03:57:35.330 --> 03:57:35.340 align:start position:0%
because we were following this along
 
03:57:37.969 --> 03:57:37.979 align:start position:0%
with Noah Majors bills that other states
 
03:57:40.189 --> 03:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
were taking this route which is a lot
 
03:57:42.830 --> 03:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
simplified compared to the formula
 
03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
method and I I represent contractors
 
03:57:48.110 --> 03:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
that work on the roads and we know that
 
03:57:50.990 --> 03:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation gets
 
03:57:53.389 --> 03:57:53.399 align:start position:0%
less funds the more electric vehicles
 
03:57:55.790 --> 03:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
they got purchased so we know the
 
03:57:58.370 --> 03:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
reality and I think this is the right
 
03:58:00.290 --> 03:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
first step I know you brought up some
 
03:58:02.929 --> 03:58:02.939 align:start position:0%
other where you might go but I think
 
03:58:04.729 --> 03:58:04.739 align:start position:0%
those are where we might go in the
 
03:58:07.729 --> 03:58:07.739 align:start position:0%
future this is really the stop gap for
 
03:58:09.950 --> 03:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
that as an association that represents
 
03:58:12.349 --> 03:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
contrary to Bill Rhodes we're okay with
 
03:58:14.929 --> 03:58:14.939 align:start position:0%
the 20 percent going to charging station
 
03:58:17.269 --> 03:58:17.279 align:start position:0%
we know that infrastructure needs to be
 
03:58:20.210 --> 03:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
built we even know that the latest
 
03:58:23.809 --> 03:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway infrastructure act added
 
03:58:26.689 --> 03:58:26.699 align:start position:0%
money for those kind of things so
 
03:58:28.790 --> 03:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
understand there's money coming from
 
03:58:31.670 --> 03:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
different places and uh you know the
 
03:58:33.110 --> 03:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
Senators absolutely right there's
 
03:58:35.030 --> 03:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
different strings with any of these
 
03:58:35.040 --> 03:58:35.870 align:start position:0%
different strings with any of these
things

03:58:35.870 --> 03:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:58:38.150 --> 03:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
but in order for those vehicles to be
 
03:58:39.349 --> 03:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
sold there needs to be the
 
03:58:41.689 --> 03:58:41.699 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in place so I think as
 
03:58:44.389 --> 03:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
the state develops they'll become more
 
03:58:46.250 --> 03:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
and more discussion of how to use that
 
03:58:49.550 --> 03:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
money so I think we're here today to in
 
03:58:50.870 --> 03:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
support this
 
03:58:53.030 --> 03:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
I will also say from sitting there the
 
03:58:55.250 --> 03:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars is a reasonable number
 
03:58:57.650 --> 03:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
even though in some of the calculations
 
03:58:58.849 --> 03:58:58.859 align:start position:0%
that know them because I remember
 
03:59:00.769 --> 03:59:00.779 align:start position:0%
looking at all the spreadsheets were
 
03:59:03.410 --> 03:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
higher for straight EVS so I don't think
 
03:59:06.710 --> 03:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a match but I think
 
03:59:08.510 --> 03:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's the first right step that you will
 
03:59:11.450 --> 03:59:11.460 align:start position:0%
see that if 30 other states have already
 
03:59:13.910 --> 03:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
before this session it's going to be
 
03:59:16.490 --> 03:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
even more States after this year goes by
 
03:59:19.729 --> 03:59:19.739 align:start position:0%
that will have these fees so I just
 
03:59:21.189 --> 03:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring that to your attention
 
03:59:24.229 --> 03:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
we're in full support of The Proposal
 
03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
that's before you and I hope this
 
03:59:29.750 --> 03:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh supports this legislation
 
03:59:31.790 --> 03:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
are you open to questions I am excellent
 
03:59:33.710 --> 03:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
03:59:35.750 --> 03:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative Phillips
 
03:59:38.269 --> 03:59:38.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I I don't know if
 
03:59:40.250 --> 03:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
you can answer this question but you
 
03:59:41.870 --> 03:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
seem to have been following this issue
 
03:59:43.610 --> 03:59:43.620 align:start position:0%
for quite a while
 
03:59:46.250 --> 03:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
um I know that when you get your vehicle
 
03:59:46.260 --> 03:59:47.929 align:start position:0%
um I know that when you get your vehicle
inspected

03:59:47.929 --> 03:59:47.939 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
03:59:50.030 --> 03:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
the person who does that is going to
 
03:59:52.330 --> 03:59:52.340 align:start position:0%
write down the mileage on your vehicle
 
03:59:55.670 --> 03:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
do you know if that information ever
 
03:59:57.769 --> 03:59:57.779 align:start position:0%
gets to the state
 
04:00:00.650 --> 04:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
so that so that somehow
 
04:00:03.590 --> 04:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
um when they're when they go to register
 
04:00:05.809 --> 04:00:05.819 align:start position:0%
if there might be some way to know how
 
04:00:08.510 --> 04:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
many miles they drove in the past year
 
04:00:10.550 --> 04:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
well I I think a lot of that discussion
 
04:00:13.790 --> 04:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
came with Norm Majors bills this is just
 
04:00:16.490 --> 04:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
a flat fee doesn't really Encompass how
 
04:00:18.530 --> 04:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
many miles you have it's just the type
 
04:00:20.689 --> 04:00:20.699 align:start position:0%
of vehicle but what I'd like to do is I
 
04:00:23.150 --> 04:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
know Scott Breyer from the Department of
 
04:00:25.130 --> 04:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
Safety who handles that is sitting
 
04:00:28.130 --> 04:00:28.140 align:start position:0%
behind me whether he wants to get up and
 
04:00:28.140 --> 04:00:29.469 align:start position:0%
behind me whether he wants to get up and
testify

04:00:29.469 --> 04:00:29.479 align:start position:0%
testify
 
04:00:31.969 --> 04:00:31.979 align:start position:0%
nice way to throw
 
04:00:34.370 --> 04:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
no I told him you know I would try not
 
04:00:37.490 --> 04:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
to put them but he is right here so he
 
04:00:40.010 --> 04:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
might be the appropriate person to ask
 
04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people behind you have
 
04:00:43.849 --> 04:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
not filled out pin cards probably for a
 
04:00:46.189 --> 04:00:46.199 align:start position:0%
reason represented a pled thank you for
 
04:00:48.170 --> 04:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
taking my question even if you had a
 
04:00:50.389 --> 04:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
mileage-based fee you still wouldn't be
 
04:00:51.950 --> 04:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
able to take in-state versus
 
04:00:54.610 --> 04:00:54.620 align:start position:0%
out-of-stage driving into a
 
04:00:57.110 --> 04:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
considerations into effect so it
 
04:00:58.790 --> 04:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be any fairer necessarily would
 
04:00:58.800 --> 04:01:00.250 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be any fairer necessarily would
it

04:01:00.250 --> 04:01:00.260 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:01:03.830 --> 04:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
every way has issues I guess is what we
 
04:01:06.229 --> 04:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
want to put on the table is that no
 
04:01:08.269 --> 04:01:08.279 align:start position:0%
matter what method you pick there are
 
04:01:10.969 --> 04:01:10.979 align:start position:0%
pros and cons to each method and I
 
04:01:13.429 --> 04:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely agreement with you I think
 
04:01:15.290 --> 04:01:15.300 align:start position:0%
people were looking for the long-term
 
04:01:18.349 --> 04:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
solution uh the user fee had a balance
 
04:01:19.969 --> 04:01:19.979 align:start position:0%
between if you had a car with lower
 
04:01:22.790 --> 04:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
mileage the fee would be adjusted but
 
04:01:24.349 --> 04:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
put all that aside that's not what's
 
04:01:27.410 --> 04:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
before you today it's really a flat fee
 
04:01:30.050 --> 04:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
to fill a gap and I think that's the
 
04:01:33.650 --> 04:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
right Next Step as we proceed forward in
 
04:01:35.269 --> 04:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
the years to come I'm sure there's going
 
04:01:37.189 --> 04:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
to be a lot more discussion on ways to
 
04:01:39.889 --> 04:01:39.899 align:start position:0%
make the fee appropriate
 
04:01:42.349 --> 04:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay the chair
 
04:01:45.290 --> 04:01:45.300 align:start position:0%
recognizes Catherine corkery I think
 
04:01:52.070 --> 04:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:53.389 --> 04:01:53.399 align:start position:0%
help us out with the proper
 
04:01:55.670 --> 04:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
pronunciation please we're actually very
 
04:01:59.210 --> 04:01:59.220 align:start position:0%
close it's porkery if you think County

04:02:15.530 --> 04:02:15.540 align:start position:0%

um we have about 14 or 15
 
04:02:32.210 --> 04:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:35.870 --> 04:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to point out I did hand out
 
04:02:38.630 --> 04:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
the blue handout
 
04:02:38.640 --> 04:02:40.189 align:start position:0%
the blue handout
and

04:02:40.189 --> 04:02:40.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
um let you know that we do oppose this
 
04:02:42.840 --> 04:02:44.229 align:start position:0%
um let you know that we do oppose this
bill

04:02:44.229 --> 04:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:02:47.870 --> 04:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
this kind of bill has been introduced
 
04:02:50.389 --> 04:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
across the country and we've seen it
 
04:02:53.570 --> 04:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
here as as you've heard many times
 
04:02:53.580 --> 04:02:54.830 align:start position:0%
here as as you've heard many times
before

04:02:54.830 --> 04:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:02:58.490 --> 04:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
I want to point out that
 
04:03:02.389 --> 04:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
this bill targets one percent of the
 
04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles and I really appreciate your
 
04:03:09.530 --> 04:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
phrasing Madam chair uh what was it is
 
04:03:13.670 --> 04:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
the juice worth the squeeze
 
04:03:16.370 --> 04:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
um this is one percent of the vehicles
 
04:03:18.110 --> 04:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
out there
 
04:03:21.050 --> 04:03:21.060 align:start position:0%
and we are taxing those people with a
 
04:03:23.870 --> 04:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
new tax and it's a hundred dollars every
 
04:03:28.849 --> 04:03:28.859 align:start position:0%
year as representative liply uh pointed
 
04:03:28.859 --> 04:03:30.349 align:start position:0%
year as representative liply uh pointed
out

04:03:30.349 --> 04:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:03:31.849 --> 04:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
um this that
 
04:03:36.530 --> 04:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
really negates the benefits of an
 
04:03:38.990 --> 04:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle
 
04:03:41.030 --> 04:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
um they have and I see representative
 
04:03:45.170 --> 04:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
almi and I have different views on this
 
04:03:45.180 --> 04:03:45.790 align:start position:0%
almi and I have different views on this
um

04:03:45.790 --> 04:03:45.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:50.689 --> 04:03:50.699 align:start position:0%
the benefits of electric vehicles is
 
04:03:52.550 --> 04:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
Public Health
 
04:03:55.990 --> 04:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
the emissions are are drastically
 
04:03:58.969 --> 04:03:58.979 align:start position:0%
reduced if not
 
04:03:58.979 --> 04:04:00.469 align:start position:0%
reduced if not
eliminated

04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
04:04:02.510 --> 04:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
and here in New Hampshire
 
04:04:08.210 --> 04:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
the transportation sector is a huge
 
04:04:12.309 --> 04:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
um source of air pollution in the state
 
04:04:17.050 --> 04:04:17.060 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to point out that
 
04:04:20.030 --> 04:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
8 000 vehicles
 
04:04:20.040 --> 04:04:20.689 align:start position:0%
8 000 vehicles
um

04:04:20.689 --> 04:04:20.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:24.110 --> 04:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
at a hundred dollars a pop isn't going
 
04:04:24.120 --> 04:04:25.250 align:start position:0%
at a hundred dollars a pop isn't going
to

04:04:25.250 --> 04:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:04:27.530 --> 04:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
build much of a road
 
04:04:29.809 --> 04:04:29.819 align:start position:0%
and even with this one hundred dollar
 
04:04:34.309 --> 04:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
fee this 100 tax
 
04:04:38.389 --> 04:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
going to 20 will go to charging
 
04:04:41.330 --> 04:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
but the rest goes into the gas tax and
 
04:04:43.729 --> 04:04:43.739 align:start position:0%
you know better than I do
 
04:04:47.150 --> 04:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
how much actually goes to roads you know
 
04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
that is sliced and diced
 
04:04:53.809 --> 04:04:53.819 align:start position:0%
and to pretend that this bill
 
04:04:56.269 --> 04:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
is going to build roads
 
04:05:01.729 --> 04:05:01.739 align:start position:0%
I think you're fooling this bill is
 
04:05:06.170 --> 04:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
is not recognizing the fact that
 
04:05:09.530 --> 04:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
the gas tax gets distributed to many
 
04:05:13.729 --> 04:05:13.739 align:start position:0%
many important accounts and I I do
 
04:05:13.739 --> 04:05:15.110 align:start position:0%
many important accounts and I I do
appreciate

04:05:15.110 --> 04:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
04:05:19.370 --> 04:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
what we what this bill presents and I
 
04:05:22.429 --> 04:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
would suggest that instead of imposing
 
04:05:26.269 --> 04:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
it on the one percent of vehicles let's
 
04:05:28.130 --> 04:05:28.140 align:start position:0%
put a floor on it
 
04:05:31.130 --> 04:05:31.140 align:start position:0%
let's wait until it actually represents
 
04:05:34.070 --> 04:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
25 of the vehicles
 
04:05:37.130 --> 04:05:37.140 align:start position:0%
I mean I feel like this bill is
 
04:05:40.309 --> 04:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
a prob what what a solution in search of
 
04:05:42.349 --> 04:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
04:05:45.590 --> 04:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
and I I really
 
04:05:45.600 --> 04:05:46.729 align:start position:0%
and I I really
um

04:05:46.729 --> 04:05:46.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:49.189 --> 04:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
suggests that you
 
04:05:52.070 --> 04:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
look deeply in this bill
 
04:05:55.969 --> 04:05:55.979 align:start position:0%
um I I will I will say oh my gosh my mom
 
04:05:57.889 --> 04:05:57.899 align:start position:0%
told me to talk about the things you
 
04:06:00.349 --> 04:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
like first and I didn't do that my
 
04:06:00.359 --> 04:06:01.910 align:start position:0%
like first and I didn't do that my
apologies

04:06:01.910 --> 04:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
apologies
 
04:06:01.920 --> 04:06:02.710 align:start position:0%
apologies
um

04:06:02.710 --> 04:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:06.349 --> 04:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
the part that says I think it starts on
 
04:06:09.469 --> 04:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
line 16. where
 
04:06:11.210 --> 04:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
um the construction of the electric
 
04:06:13.670 --> 04:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle service equipment
 
04:06:16.550 --> 04:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
on the transportation tour corridors
 
04:06:18.530 --> 04:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
utilizing plans developed by the
 
04:06:22.490 --> 04:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
department in consultation with des and
 
04:06:24.830 --> 04:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
the transportation Council and drive
 
04:06:26.870 --> 04:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
Electric New Hampshire that's really
 
04:06:30.889 --> 04:06:30.899 align:start position:0%
great I I do support that piece of the
 
04:06:34.189 --> 04:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
bill I think the there is a lot of
 
04:06:34.199 --> 04:06:35.889 align:start position:0%
bill I think the there is a lot of
opportunity

04:06:35.889 --> 04:06:35.899 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
04:06:40.030 --> 04:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
inciting charge charging stations
 
04:06:44.570 --> 04:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
but at the risk of preventing people
 
04:06:47.990 --> 04:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
and at the risk of supporting Public
 
04:06:52.969 --> 04:06:52.979 align:start position:0%
Health this bill is a problem in search
 
04:06:55.910 --> 04:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
of a solution right is it a solution in
 
04:06:58.090 --> 04:06:58.100 align:start position:0%
search of a problem
 
04:07:00.950 --> 04:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
I always get those wrong but
 
04:07:04.429 --> 04:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
um with that I conclude my testimony
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you all right I see some hands up
 
04:07:07.849 --> 04:07:07.859 align:start position:0%
are you open to taking some questions
 
04:07:07.859 --> 04:07:11.290 align:start position:0%
are you open to taking some questions
representative

04:07:11.290 --> 04:07:11.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:14.630 --> 04:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh and thank you for taking questions
 
04:07:14.640 --> 04:07:15.950 align:start position:0%
uh and thank you for taking questions
um

04:07:15.950 --> 04:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:19.490 --> 04:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
I represent Nashua Nashua right now is
 
04:07:21.830 --> 04:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with a request to build an
 
04:07:25.429 --> 04:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
asphalt plant in the familiar City and
 
04:07:27.229 --> 04:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that we are looking
 
04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
at is the impact of traffic on the roads
 
04:07:30.479 --> 04:07:33.110 align:start position:0%
at is the impact of traffic on the roads
so

04:07:33.110 --> 04:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:36.170 --> 04:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles will have an impact on
 
04:07:37.250 --> 04:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
the roads
 
04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
and from my mind they need to have
 
04:07:44.929 --> 04:07:44.939 align:start position:0%
some uh
 
04:07:48.410 --> 04:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
input as in financial input into the
 
04:07:50.290 --> 04:07:50.300 align:start position:0%
maintenance of those roads and bridges
 
04:07:53.929 --> 04:07:53.939 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure
 
04:07:53.939 --> 04:07:56.030 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure
how

04:07:56.030 --> 04:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
how
 
04:07:59.750 --> 04:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
your suggestions address that
 
04:07:59.760 --> 04:08:00.469 align:start position:0%
your suggestions address that
um

04:08:00.469 --> 04:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:03.290 --> 04:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
waiting until we have 25 percent of
 
04:08:05.450 --> 04:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles
 
04:08:07.070 --> 04:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
04:08:11.210 --> 04:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
until then for the 24.9 percent and when
 
04:08:13.250 --> 04:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
do those vehicle owners
 
04:08:13.260 --> 04:08:14.650 align:start position:0%
do those vehicle owners
start

04:08:14.650 --> 04:08:14.660 align:start position:0%
start
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
paying for the maintenance of the roads
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
and bridges and other pieces that they
 
04:08:19.680 --> 04:08:20.510 align:start position:0%
and bridges and other pieces that they
use

04:08:20.510 --> 04:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
use
 
04:08:24.110 --> 04:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
I I respectfully request that the
 
04:08:24.120 --> 04:08:27.170 align:start position:0%
I I respectfully request that the
representative

04:08:27.170 --> 04:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:30.050 --> 04:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
remember that they electric vehicles
 
04:08:34.189 --> 04:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
play pay road tolls and they also have
 
04:08:38.750 --> 04:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
registration so they do pay in part
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
um and also uh that
 
04:08:45.769 --> 04:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
the plug-in hybrids these there is a
 
04:08:49.130 --> 04:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
Prius that has a plug-in so it just
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
confuses everything I'm sorry
 
04:08:56.030 --> 04:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
um there is a plug-in Prius but those
 
04:08:57.950 --> 04:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
Vehicles those
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
um plug-in hybrids will contribute and I
 
04:09:04.910 --> 04:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
agree the electric vehicles and I I
 
04:09:07.010 --> 04:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
think the owners want to contribute
 
04:09:07.020 --> 04:09:08.870 align:start position:0%
think the owners want to contribute
however

04:09:08.870 --> 04:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:09:12.889 --> 04:09:12.899 align:start position:0%
this contribution isn't very meaningful
 
04:09:15.490 --> 04:09:15.500 align:start position:0%
and and I think
 
04:09:21.650 --> 04:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
what we can do is move move forward when
 
04:09:23.990 --> 04:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
it can be meaningful
 
04:09:28.269 --> 04:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
and in the meantime look at the gas tax
 
04:09:34.130 --> 04:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
it goes all over many many agencies get
 
04:09:37.729 --> 04:09:37.739 align:start position:0%
a piece of that pie and maybe it's time
 
04:09:41.750 --> 04:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
to reevaluate that and send all the
 
04:09:44.210 --> 04:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
money or more of the money to Road
 
04:09:44.220 --> 04:09:46.610 align:start position:0%
money or more of the money to Road
building

04:09:46.610 --> 04:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:49.849 --> 04:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
follow up okay thank you
 
04:09:52.610 --> 04:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
um that may be we're not charged with
 
04:09:54.830 --> 04:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
that here that's not as far as I know
 
04:09:57.769 --> 04:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
within the purview of this committee uh
 
04:10:00.410 --> 04:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
I want to go back though to one of your
 
04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
comments about
 
04:10:06.830 --> 04:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
this would be a surcharge surtax
 
04:10:09.170 --> 04:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
whatever we would want to call it that
 
04:10:13.610 --> 04:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:16.010 --> 04:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
people who are using gas vehicles are
 
04:10:18.170 --> 04:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
paying the tax every time they fill up
 
04:10:20.570 --> 04:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
you know I'm paying that all of us here
 
04:10:24.349 --> 04:10:24.359 align:start position:0%
who drive gas vehicles do so again I'm
 
04:10:26.510 --> 04:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
wondering about
 
04:10:29.330 --> 04:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
why are we saying that it's okay to
 
04:10:29.340 --> 04:10:30.590 align:start position:0%
why are we saying that it's okay to
exempt

04:10:30.590 --> 04:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
04:10:34.809 --> 04:10:34.819 align:start position:0%
one group of vehicle owners from
 
04:10:38.090 --> 04:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
supporting roads and bridges
 
04:10:41.570 --> 04:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
when we're not doing that with others I
 
04:10:44.269 --> 04:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
think actually we are the heavier
 
04:10:48.170 --> 04:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
Vehicles do and fleet vehicles do get
 
04:10:53.570 --> 04:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
discounts on on their on their Diesel
 
04:10:55.370 --> 04:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
and and gas
 
04:10:57.950 --> 04:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh consumption
 
04:11:00.889 --> 04:11:00.899 align:start position:0%
um and and I'm sure our friend who has
 
04:11:04.790 --> 04:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
been noted before uh can explain
 
04:11:08.210 --> 04:11:08.220 align:start position:0%
um that in more detail uh but heavier
 
04:11:11.510 --> 04:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
Vehicles do more damage on the road but
 
04:11:14.269 --> 04:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
they get waivers as well so
 
04:11:18.889 --> 04:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
again this is 8 000 ish vehicles I don't
 
04:11:22.729 --> 04:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
it's I don't think it's time yet
 
04:11:27.830 --> 04:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
um for them uh to to tax them uh a
 
04:11:31.250 --> 04:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a year just yet when
 
04:11:35.990 --> 04:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
they make up more of a percentage of the
 
04:11:38.330 --> 04:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
vehicle population I think it would be
 
04:11:38.340 --> 04:11:40.849 align:start position:0%
vehicle population I think it would be
appropriate

04:11:40.849 --> 04:11:40.859 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
04:11:42.950 --> 04:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay more questions representative
 
04:11:42.960 --> 04:11:44.269 align:start position:0%
okay more questions representative
lippley

04:11:44.269 --> 04:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
lippley
 
04:11:45.650 --> 04:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:11:48.229 --> 04:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate everyone who's come to
 
04:11:51.410 --> 04:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
testify I'm doing my research over here
 
04:11:51.420 --> 04:11:52.189 align:start position:0%
testify I'm doing my research over here
um

04:11:52.189 --> 04:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:54.710 --> 04:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
and and what I'm looking at I don't see
 
04:11:57.830 --> 04:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
any other New England states
 
04:12:00.170 --> 04:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
um do you happen to know
 
04:12:02.210 --> 04:12:02.220 align:start position:0%
um if the other states in New England
 
04:12:04.849 --> 04:12:04.859 align:start position:0%
are taxing
 
04:12:09.229 --> 04:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
um in this manner and if so which ones
 
04:12:11.929 --> 04:12:11.939 align:start position:0%
and if it's at the same rate I'm sorry I
 
04:12:14.210 --> 04:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
don't have it on me right now but I can
 
04:12:15.950 --> 04:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
certainly get it for you
 
04:12:18.530 --> 04:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe they are and I do
 
04:12:20.950 --> 04:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
know uh when California
 
04:12:25.309 --> 04:12:25.319 align:start position:0%
instituted their tax they also had
 
04:12:29.450 --> 04:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
um a floor and in in which it triggered
 
04:12:30.950 --> 04:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
the tax
 
04:12:33.889 --> 04:12:33.899 align:start position:0%
um that they did not charge it until
 
04:12:36.769 --> 04:12:36.779 align:start position:0%
after they got a certain percentage and
 
04:12:39.110 --> 04:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
that just went in I think last year the
 
04:12:40.490 --> 04:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
year before
 
04:12:42.170 --> 04:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:12:44.150 --> 04:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
other questions over here
 
04:12:47.150 --> 04:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
and over here yes representative fellows
 
04:12:49.309 --> 04:12:49.319 align:start position:0%
so let's thank you
 
04:12:52.010 --> 04:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
um let's suppose that 80 of the cars on
 
04:12:54.650 --> 04:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
the road are electric or plug-in hybrid
 
04:12:56.929 --> 04:12:56.939 align:start position:0%
what how would you suggest
 
04:12:56.939 --> 04:12:58.370 align:start position:0%
what how would you suggest
getting

04:12:58.370 --> 04:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
getting
 
04:13:02.030 --> 04:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
um taxation or whatever what means would
 
04:13:05.530 --> 04:13:05.540 align:start position:0%
you suggest for getting money to support
 
04:13:09.410 --> 04:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
the roads well I think
 
04:13:11.689 --> 04:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
um that actually is a really good
 
04:13:11.699 --> 04:13:13.189 align:start position:0%
um that actually is a really good
question

04:13:13.189 --> 04:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:13:17.330 --> 04:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
um there is the electricity side of
 
04:13:21.290 --> 04:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
things I'm that that uh was alluded to
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
earlier with that time of use
 
04:13:30.650 --> 04:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
um electrification uh and that is uh has
 
04:13:33.229 --> 04:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
been instituted elsewhere
 
04:13:36.590 --> 04:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
um and it's definitely something that a
 
04:13:39.530 --> 04:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
lot of smarter people than myself have
 
04:13:41.689 --> 04:13:41.699 align:start position:0%
have looked into
 
04:13:45.110 --> 04:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
um and and I think it is
 
04:13:48.410 --> 04:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
it it might be the way that New
 
04:13:51.469 --> 04:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should go looking at their
 
04:13:53.570 --> 04:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
electric charging
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
um and and working with the utilities
 
04:13:56.399 --> 04:13:57.590 align:start position:0%
um and and working with the utilities
maybe

04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:14:00.530 --> 04:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
um and actually have a really
 
04:14:03.110 --> 04:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
interesting handout that I can share
 
04:14:05.710 --> 04:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
with the committee about
 
04:14:09.710 --> 04:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
using electric charging fees
 
04:14:13.490 --> 04:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
as opposed to like a flat fee or or
 
04:14:18.170 --> 04:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:18.180 --> 04:14:20.269 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

04:14:20.269 --> 04:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:14:22.969 --> 04:14:22.979 align:start position:0%
I I would think if you
 
04:14:26.870 --> 04:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
um had to put your car charging port on
 
04:14:29.630 --> 04:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
a separate account from the electricity
 
04:14:32.750 --> 04:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
that just goes to your whole house just
 
04:14:35.510 --> 04:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
the basic fee that goes with an account
 
04:14:37.790 --> 04:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
would end up costing people a lot more
 
04:14:39.290 --> 04:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
than what we're talking about here
 
04:14:41.269 --> 04:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you think so
 
04:14:43.849 --> 04:14:43.859 align:start position:0%
if you did it that way we have high you
 
04:14:46.250 --> 04:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
know High electric rates yeah I'm well
 
04:14:48.410 --> 04:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
aware of that
 
04:14:50.929 --> 04:14:50.939 align:start position:0%
um yes uh but I think that's something
 
04:14:54.110 --> 04:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
that this committee can explore if they
 
04:14:57.410 --> 04:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:00.349 --> 04:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:02.870 --> 04:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you I do not
 
04:15:04.670 --> 04:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
have any more pink cards is there anyone
 
04:15:05.689 --> 04:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
else who would like to speak
 
04:15:11.090 --> 04:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:18.110 --> 04:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:21.490 --> 04:15:21.500 align:start position:0%
come on up if you're willing to
 
04:15:24.110 --> 04:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
well and of course before you leave if
 
04:15:25.490 --> 04:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
you could fill out a pin card as well
 
04:15:28.250 --> 04:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
that'd be helpful for our Clerk
 
04:15:30.590 --> 04:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
but come up uh thank you very much for
 
04:15:32.510 --> 04:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
combinating US Representative Ami did
 
04:15:34.670 --> 04:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you yeah I had two questions
 
04:15:37.550 --> 04:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
one of them it may be outside of your
 
04:15:37.560 --> 04:15:39.410 align:start position:0%
one of them it may be outside of your
purview

04:15:39.410 --> 04:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
purview
 
04:15:43.010 --> 04:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
um but on the one that I'm sure is in
 
04:15:46.429 --> 04:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
your purview is could you explain the
 
04:15:51.290 --> 04:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
differing on on miles per gallon
 
04:15:56.450 --> 04:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
on Penny pennies per gallon tax
 
04:16:01.090 --> 04:16:01.100 align:start position:0%
how much brings in how much no how sorry
 
04:16:04.670 --> 04:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
on between large trucks medium trucks
 
04:16:08.809 --> 04:16:08.819 align:start position:0%
small trucks and Passenger cars on how
 
04:16:11.210 --> 04:16:11.220 align:start position:0%
much each of them are taxed by the state
 
04:16:11.220 --> 04:16:12.170 align:start position:0%
much each of them are taxed by the state
at

04:16:12.170 --> 04:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:16:12.180 --> 04:16:15.349 align:start position:0%
at
registration

04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:17.570 --> 04:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
okay I work for the division
 
04:16:19.670 --> 04:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
Administration I'm the administrator of
 
04:16:21.769 --> 04:16:21.779 align:start position:0%
the Royal Farm Road toll administrator
 
04:16:23.330 --> 04:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
which basically I administered the motor
 
04:16:25.370 --> 04:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
fuel gasoline diesel taxes and the
 
04:16:26.929 --> 04:16:26.939 align:start position:0%
international fuel tax agreement program
 
04:16:29.870 --> 04:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
okay I say yeah that would have that
 
04:16:31.790 --> 04:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
specific I could probably
 
04:16:33.590 --> 04:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
take questions and bring them back to
 
04:16:35.570 --> 04:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
the department and get back to you but
 
04:16:37.790 --> 04:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh that probably be more uh Jeff
 
04:16:40.370 --> 04:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
oberdank in uh registration
 
04:16:44.389 --> 04:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
okay it was different back when we did
 
04:16:48.550 --> 04:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:51.769 --> 04:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
on and if sorry go ahead you probably
 
04:16:53.809 --> 04:16:53.819 align:start position:0%
can't do the other one either but I want
 
04:16:55.370 --> 04:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
to put a question out there in case
 
04:16:56.510 --> 04:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
there's someone else who wants to
 
04:17:02.929 --> 04:17:02.939 align:start position:0%
volunteer on the percentage of the on
 
04:17:07.550 --> 04:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
Highway fun that goes to something other
 
04:17:11.630 --> 04:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
than building and repairing roads
 
04:17:14.150 --> 04:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
all right I do know that uh
 
04:17:17.330 --> 04:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
Local 6A at the State Constitution only
 
04:17:19.849 --> 04:17:19.859 align:start position:0%
allows the money to go to construction
 
04:17:19.859 --> 04:17:22.309 align:start position:0%
allows the money to go to construction
maintenance

04:17:22.309 --> 04:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
04:17:24.769 --> 04:17:24.779 align:start position:0%
we leave the bond pay the bonds off on
 
04:17:27.710 --> 04:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
the roads there is a stipulation that it
 
04:17:29.269 --> 04:17:29.279 align:start position:0%
can be used for enforcement of the
 
04:17:32.389 --> 04:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
traffic that department of safety gets a
 
04:17:34.910 --> 04:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
piece of it I believe there's a cap for
 
04:17:36.710 --> 04:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
safety I'm not sure the exact cap I
 
04:17:39.410 --> 04:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
think it's about 23 or 24 percent
 
04:17:42.349 --> 04:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
and uh for the most part the big issues
 
04:17:44.030 --> 04:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
are that I'm aware of the highway fund
 
04:17:45.889 --> 04:17:45.899 align:start position:0%
other than safety the big issues there
 
04:17:48.170 --> 04:17:48.180 align:start position:0%
is the Department of Transportation
 
04:17:50.570 --> 04:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
I think they get about 70 something
 
04:17:50.580 --> 04:17:52.210 align:start position:0%
I think they get about 70 something
percent

04:17:52.210 --> 04:17:52.220 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:17:54.050 --> 04:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
here they probably can answer the
 
04:17:57.229 --> 04:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
question so safety takes that much
 
04:18:02.210 --> 04:18:02.220 align:start position:0%
no we only take like 20 it's like 22 23
 
04:18:04.010 --> 04:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
I don't have the exact amount but I know
 
04:18:05.929 --> 04:18:05.939 align:start position:0%
there's a cap on it
 
04:18:09.229 --> 04:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
yeah there is a cap in the statute that
 
04:18:14.030 --> 04:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
how much safety can get versus uh Dot
 
04:18:17.030 --> 04:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
and safety it uses it for the state
 
04:18:17.040 --> 04:18:18.950 align:start position:0%
and safety it uses it for the state
troopers

04:18:18.950 --> 04:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
troopers
 
04:18:21.349 --> 04:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
um just the State Troopers that are
 
04:18:25.610 --> 04:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
assigned to uh High state roads
 
04:18:27.229 --> 04:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
um if there are sites like the turnpikes
 
04:18:28.670 --> 04:18:28.680 align:start position:0%
and so forth that funded out of the
 
04:18:31.910 --> 04:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
turnpike fund yeah and Troopers that do
 
04:18:34.010 --> 04:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
more uh investigative work of funded out
 
04:18:36.349 --> 04:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
of general fund
 
04:18:40.130 --> 04:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:43.070 --> 04:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
I think it was uh Mr Abbott who told us
 
04:18:46.070 --> 04:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
about the roughly 30 states that he'd
 
04:18:49.670 --> 04:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
identified by a quick look on I assume
 
04:18:51.889 --> 04:18:51.899 align:start position:0%
your iPhone
 
04:18:55.250 --> 04:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
that have adopted some kind of flat rate
 
04:18:58.070 --> 04:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
system for
 
04:18:58.080 --> 04:18:59.809 align:start position:0%
system for
getting

04:18:59.809 --> 04:18:59.819 align:start position:0%
getting
 
04:19:02.389 --> 04:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
funds from electric vehicles that don't
 
04:19:06.650 --> 04:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
otherwise pay a gas tax or a road tow
 
04:19:08.510 --> 04:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it I'm
 
04:19:10.849 --> 04:19:10.859 align:start position:0%
wondering whether you've done a survey
 
04:19:12.769 --> 04:19:12.779 align:start position:0%
of any sort whether you have anything
 
04:19:14.269 --> 04:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
that you could provide us that would
 
04:19:17.269 --> 04:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
help help paint that picture for us I
 
04:19:19.429 --> 04:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
don't I can I can get you that
 
04:19:21.950 --> 04:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
information but I would say Gary Gary
 
04:19:25.070 --> 04:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
Abbott's uh what he stated about 30
 
04:19:27.650 --> 04:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
States is probably very accurate I don't
 
04:19:30.410 --> 04:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
have the exact number but I'd be happy
 
04:19:33.110 --> 04:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
to find that out for you but I think I
 
04:19:35.330 --> 04:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
think that would be helpful yeah
 
04:19:38.090 --> 04:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
if you could that'd be great and and I
 
04:19:39.050 --> 04:19:39.060 align:start position:0%
think there was definitely some interest
 
04:19:45.469 --> 04:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:47.750 --> 04:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative Spielberg
 
04:19:49.550 --> 04:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
um can I correct that error
 
04:19:55.309 --> 04:19:55.319 align:start position:0%
road toll is currently 22 cents a gallon
 
04:19:58.809 --> 04:19:58.819 align:start position:0%
for gasoline uh road toll is
 
04:20:01.610 --> 04:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
22.2 cents per gallon for gasoline
 
04:20:01.620 --> 04:20:05.170 align:start position:0%
22.2 cents per gallon for gasoline
diesel

04:20:05.170 --> 04:20:05.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:07.790 --> 04:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
and is there any other fuel product we
 
04:20:10.429 --> 04:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
apply that text to C and G
 
04:20:14.389 --> 04:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
compressed natural gas propane and uh
 
04:20:17.210 --> 04:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
We There are taxes on alternative fuels
 
04:20:17.220 --> 04:20:18.349 align:start position:0%
We There are taxes on alternative fuels
now

04:20:18.349 --> 04:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:20:20.090 --> 04:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
um the only one all of which go to the
 
04:20:24.349 --> 04:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:25.729 --> 04:20:25.739 align:start position:0%
represent rames did you have another
 
04:20:30.170 --> 04:20:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:31.729 --> 04:20:31.739 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming up all right uh
 
04:20:35.210 --> 04:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
don't forget pink card okay I just uh a
 
04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
few things is uh make sure that
 
04:20:38.689 --> 04:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
department safety is completely neutral
 
04:20:39.830 --> 04:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
04:20:42.769 --> 04:20:42.779 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:20:44.870 --> 04:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
I I do I do sit on the international
 
04:20:47.210 --> 04:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
field tax agreement Board of Trustees
 
04:20:51.050 --> 04:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
and I and I will tell you that um
 
04:20:53.510 --> 04:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
that all the states are really looking
 
04:20:56.570 --> 04:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
into these feasts and um
 
04:20:58.309 --> 04:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
I'm just giving you what I hear
 
04:21:00.590 --> 04:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
nationally on the national Federation of
 
04:21:02.990 --> 04:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
tax administrators in international fuel
 
04:21:05.809 --> 04:21:05.819 align:start position:0%
tax agreement and I think what will
 
04:21:08.450 --> 04:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
happen I think it's going to be about 20
 
04:21:10.910 --> 04:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
years before gasoline and Diesel I think
 
04:21:12.590 --> 04:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a mix it's going to be
 
04:21:14.870 --> 04:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
gasoline Diesel and Electric
 
04:21:17.030 --> 04:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
but we're going with that is I think
 
04:21:18.590 --> 04:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
what you're going to see in several
 
04:21:20.450 --> 04:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
years to come is going to be basically a
 
04:21:23.030 --> 04:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
mileage tax they're going to have to do
 
04:21:25.429 --> 04:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
something because reason the gasoline
 
04:21:27.650 --> 04:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
tax is so fair because you purchased the
 
04:21:30.050 --> 04:21:30.060 align:start position:0%
gasoline that you actually use the taxes
 
04:21:31.849 --> 04:21:31.859 align:start position:0%
based on usage
 
04:21:34.370 --> 04:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
and that's probably the first way to do
 
04:21:35.990 --> 04:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
attacks but
 
04:21:38.809 --> 04:21:38.819 align:start position:0%
probably just added that but
 
04:21:41.570 --> 04:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate your input
 
04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
um just a quick question Who should I
 
04:21:45.710 --> 04:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
send the uh want to get that information
 
04:21:47.269 --> 04:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
could you send it to me and then I'll
 
04:21:48.650 --> 04:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
make sure everyone on the committee gets
 
04:21:50.269 --> 04:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
it I will do that thank you appreciate
 
04:21:50.279 --> 04:21:51.110 align:start position:0%
it I will do that thank you appreciate
that

04:21:51.110 --> 04:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:21:53.030 --> 04:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
and just just so you know guys as a
 
04:21:55.130 --> 04:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
reminder that is the typical format is
 
04:21:56.689 --> 04:21:56.699 align:start position:0%
if you have a question you run it
 
04:21:57.769 --> 04:21:57.779 align:start position:0%
through the chair and then the
 
04:21:59.090 --> 04:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
information comes to the chair and I
 
04:22:00.530 --> 04:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
send it back out
 
04:22:02.269 --> 04:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
just so that we don't bog our agencies
 
04:22:03.889 --> 04:22:03.899 align:start position:0%
down with too many little questions
 
04:22:07.070 --> 04:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
along the way okay no more pink cards so
 
04:22:08.750 --> 04:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
we will now close the public hearing on
 
04:22:11.570 --> 04:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 191.
 
04:22:14.389 --> 04:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
and we are done for today and I am
 
04:22:17.150 --> 04:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
planning to schedule a bunch of hearings
 
04:22:21.170 --> 04:22:21.180 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday and Wednesday and we'll see
 
04:22:23.510 --> 04:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
if we're ready to do some exec exact
 
04:22:25.969 --> 04:22:25.979 align:start position:0%
sessions at that time as well
 
04:22:28.070 --> 04:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
um obviously we got a lot of information
 
04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
today I kind of need to process it a
 
04:22:32.570 --> 04:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
little bit and see where we're at
 
04:22:34.670 --> 04:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
questions comments
 
04:22:37.490 --> 04:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:22:40.250 --> 04:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I have received
 
04:22:41.689 --> 04:22:41.699 align:start position:0%
something I hope I'm not the only one
 
04:22:45.229 --> 04:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
who got uh information about Senate 260
 
04:22:48.410 --> 04:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
FN and I don't know whether I was
 
04:22:51.469 --> 04:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
privileged to be the only one I was not
 
04:22:53.750 --> 04:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
and why we got it
 
04:22:56.150 --> 04:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
is that the fit is that a fiscal note
 
04:22:58.610 --> 04:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about or a bill this
 
04:23:06.710 --> 04:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:09.349 --> 04:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why we got it today is the
 
04:23:09.359 --> 04:23:11.929 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why we got it today is the
question

04:23:11.929 --> 04:23:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:14.030 --> 04:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh maybe because it just got assigned to
 
04:23:16.849 --> 04:23:16.859 align:start position:0%
our committee I don't know
 
04:23:16.859 --> 04:23:17.510 align:start position:0%
our committee I don't know
um

04:23:17.510 --> 04:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:19.550 --> 04:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
we didn't get all of the bills from
 
04:23:22.250 --> 04:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
Senate all at once we got some dribbling
 
04:23:24.229 --> 04:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
in after so maybe that's why I don't
 
04:23:24.239 --> 04:23:36.349 align:start position:0%
in after so maybe that's why I don't
know

04:23:36.349 --> 04:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:36.359 --> 04:23:39.229 align:start position:0%
 
I

04:23:39.229 --> 04:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:41.990 --> 04:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
so if you need copies of any of the
 
04:23:43.729 --> 04:23:43.739 align:start position:0%
bills Karen should have them in her
 
04:23:46.790 --> 04:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
office and uh there's a filing drawer
 
04:23:49.010 --> 04:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
that has all of them so go see her if
 
04:23:51.469 --> 04:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
you're not sure where that is
 
04:23:51.479 --> 04:24:15.229 align:start position:0%
you're not sure where that is
she

04:24:15.229 --> 04:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:15.239 --> 04:24:39.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:24:39.250 --> 04:24:39.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:41.870 --> 04:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
five seconds
