us why is that and how does hb86 relate
 
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:22.280 align:start position:0%
to this one of the reasons over a third
 
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
of grand estaters are not very confident
 
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
in our election results is that we have
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
the loosest election laws in the country
 
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:32.919 align:start position:0%
the quote experts come before us and
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
tell us that voter fraud does not exist
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire what they do not
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
address is exactly what is voter fraud
 
00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:42.519 align:start position:0%
as I have pointed out in this committee
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
someone who is in this state for only 30
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
seconds can legally vote here in fact 30
 
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
seconds is 29 seconds more than you
 
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:52.949 align:start position:0%
seconds is 29 seconds more than you
actually

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
need when you have a system like ours
 
00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
which is right for abuse and in fact
 
00:08:59.949 --> 00:08:59.959 align:start position:0%
does not even label what many people
 
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
would constitute as abuse no wonder you
 
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
end up with people not having faith in
 
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
our elections let me be clear someone
 
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
who moves here on Election Day and votes
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
here and then
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
decides to another state the next day
 
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
does not actually commit a crime in New
 
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is not a law it is not
 
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
under our law considered fraud unless
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
they also voted in their home
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
state that's our law it's almost
 
00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:28.959 align:start position:0%
impossible to commit voter fraud in New
 
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because what is cons what
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
should be considered fraud simply
 
00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
isn't the fact that we have a system
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
that allows nonresidents to walk into
 
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
our polling location register to vote
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
while presenting no ID no proof of
 
00:09:48.069 --> 00:09:48.079 align:start position:0%
domicile is actually shameful it is a
 
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire specific embarrassment
 
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
hb86 attempts to address this often the
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office holds up the
 
00:09:59.069 --> 00:09:59.079 align:start position:0%
voter age participation statistic where
 
00:09:59.079 --> 00:10:00.030 align:start position:0%
voter age participation statistic where
the

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
as the number that we should be
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
concerned about but I am far more
 
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
concerned about people believing we have
 
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
fair and honest elections than an
 
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number that does not begin to
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
tell the whole story of what is actually
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
going on the whole story is that while
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
we have high voter participation we also
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
have a high degree of skepticism in our
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
elections and in my opinion the bad is
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
grossly outling The Good the Secretary
 
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
of State office often talks about a
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
balancing act but right now we are fully
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
tilted in One Direction and The cost is
 
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
people not having faith in the voting
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
process unfortunately hb86 needs a lot
 
00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
of work and it's not a clean bill I
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate what the sponsors are trying
 
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
to do here but they're going about it in
 
00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:46.519 align:start position:0%
the wrong way and incorporating non-
 
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:49.160 align:start position:0%
gerine issues such as trying to suppress
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
the college student V I hope that this
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
committee will wake up to the reality
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
that when a full third of our citizens
 
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
are not very confident in our election
 
00:10:59.949 --> 00:10:59.959 align:start position:0%
that we have a lot of work to do it is
 
00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
time to end the excuses and get to work
 
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately hb86 is an imperfect
 
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle to do this and as such I move
 
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
that we retain the bill to continue to
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
work on
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
it is there any further discussion on
 
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
the um yes Madam chair I have a question
 
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:20.600 align:start position:0%

polling
 
00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
place but what happens if a resident
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
forgets to change their party
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
affiliation back to
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
Undeclared what happens if a resident
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
wants to support a candidate only to
 
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
discover at the polls that their own
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
party affiliation is inconsistent with
 
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
their candidates what happens if a
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
resident insists they changed their
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
affiliation back to Undeclared the last
 
00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
time they voted in a primary but the
 
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
last one two three or more checklists
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
has them listed as either Republican or
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
Democrat instead
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
in any of these cases the potential
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
exists to have a resident who leaves the
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
polls very angry without having voted or
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
we have a resident who leaves the polls
 
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
very angry having voted on a B on a
 
00:17:44.909 --> 00:17:44.919 align:start position:0%

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%

you think it's
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
unburdened to do that
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
sorry you hear me okay yes I could hear
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
apologize I I thank you for the question
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative um I do not feel no I do
 
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
not feel it's a burden uh to repeat that
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
word I do not feel it's a burden but I
 
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
feel this simplifies the process and I
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
and I say that because I'm responding to
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
my own town moderator I happen to be a
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
select been in my town and I've worked
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
at the polls for each of my four terms
 
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
and there have been those instances
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
where as I've said a a voter has come in
 
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
and said well I am registered as or I am
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
you know I should be this or I should be
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
that and it creates uh it has at times
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
created problems for the moderator so
 
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
while it is I don't see a burden or I
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
don't see a a systemic problem what I
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
would like to see what I would like to
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
accomplish with this bill is a
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%

representative instances in which voter
 
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
to I could you repeat the question I'm

sorry

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
representative um what about those
 
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
instances in which may not want to be
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
returned play status may want to stay
 
00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:34.039 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
part that's that is a very good question
 
00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:38.679 align:start position:0%
and and and thank you for that question
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh something I've thought about it's
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
actually the the antithesis to to what
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
this is trying to accomplish um and that
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
process I believe would require the uh
 
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
the voter to go to the town clerk as
 
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
they would for
 
00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
Undeclared uh or or any other party to
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
register their intentions to remain with
 
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.549 align:start position:0%
register their intentions to remain with
that

00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%

H okay hi representative majori um so my

previous one do we know how many people
 
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to change back to Undeclared
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
after they vote they want to stay with
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
the party do we have any idea like how
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
many people usually just want to stay in

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
they reached out to me so it was
 
00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
encouraging to say that uh hearing from
 
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist in several
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
different communities uh that they
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
thought this process would be uh would
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
be very readily uh integrated into their
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
process uh and they would be able to do
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
it however that said I would certainly
 
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
entertain be more than willing to
 
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
entertain an amendment if uh if this
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
committee felt that uh some time certain
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
some time period might make this easier
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
I I would be certainly open to that as
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
it certainly is your bill now I would
 
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
conversation thank you thank you
 
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:36.520 align:start position:0%

with us good morning good morning thank
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
you so much Madam chair and members of
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
the election law committee I really
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time to be here to be
 
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
able to speak on this I can say that I
 
00:25:42.389 --> 00:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
have volunteered as a pole worker at a
 
00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:45.559 align:start position:0%
small town and have in that role
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
experience a lot of questions regarding
 
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
Undeclared voters as they arrive at the
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
polling location with the intent to vote
 
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
for a specific candidate and as a result
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
of not having been switched back in the
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
last election
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
that they were not able to vote for the
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
person they intended to on the ballot
 
00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039 align:start position:0%
that they intended to so with that being
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
said in a town that had about 800 people
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
vote uh in the presidential primary that
 
00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
out of that 800 I would conservatively
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
say from my personal anecdote that about
 
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
15 to 20 people specifically came up uh
 
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
in equal proportions from both parties
 
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919 align:start position:0%
or who are registered
 
00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:26.919 align:start position:0%
to uh either of the two major parties
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
looking to switch to the other major
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
party in the specific election leaving
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
themselves to be an Undeclared voter
 
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:36.039 align:start position:0%
with the ability to choose which ballot
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
that they were able to take and were not
 
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
able to do so so I can say from my
 
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
personal experience that this is an
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
issue that is been raised by members in
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
that Community to me I would also like
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
to speak to an earlier question that was
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
asked of what happens if someone wants
 
00:26:59.950 --> 00:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
to remain with a party uh I'd like to
 
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
just kind of think of the counterfactual
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
here so if
 
00:27:05.789 --> 00:27:05.799 align:start position:0%
someone is an Undeclared voter and they
 
00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
wishes and they wish to stay with uh
 
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
party that they have taken the ballot
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
from the worst case scenario is that
 
00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
they are then an Undeclared voter again
 
00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
in the next election and can still
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
choose to take the ballot of that party
 
00:27:24.269 --> 00:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
and have other opportunities to switch
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
to become that um a member of that party
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
whereas someone who is an Undeclared
 
00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.070 align:start position:0%
whereas someone who is an Undeclared
voter

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
voter
 
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
who for whatever rush or whatever reason
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
that they don't fill out that form at
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
the end of the day that they come back
 
00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:42.039 align:start position:0%
to this next election and they are not
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
able to choose the ballot and vote for
 
00:27:47.389 --> 00:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
the candidate that they intend to so I
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
think the counterfactual there is
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
important and I'd also say that I agree
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
with the sponsors uh points regarding
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
simplification of this process uh for
 
00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:00.039 align:start position:0%
members of the poll team and the uh
 
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist uh thank you
 
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
so much for the ability to speak and if
 
00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
there are any questions I'd be welcome
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
to entertain them thank you for joining
 
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
us again is there anybody here in the
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
committee room who has any questions for
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
Mr is there anybody attending
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
questions I'm not seeing any so thank
 
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
you also with the request to speak to
 
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is Tiana Coleman
 
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
M colan I think if you unmute yourself
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
you will be with us good morning good
 
00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for allowing me to
 
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
speak uh most of the members of this
 
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
committee have seen me speak before but
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
I'm here representing myself as a
 
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
citizen of Amherst and also representing
 
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire independent voters which
 
00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
is fully uh volunteer so I did not get
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
paid to be here um so um a couple of
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
things first off we of course support
 
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
this bill we are uh Undeclared voters
 
00:29:03.789 --> 00:29:03.799 align:start position:0%
and this definitely makes the process a
 
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
lot easier for us to not have to fill
 
00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:08.519 align:start position:0%
out the little postcard at the end when
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
we walk
 
00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:12.919 align:start position:0%
out uh the question was asked earlier
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
whether people um how many people intend
 
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
to stay with that party but do
 
00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
not how many people actually intend to
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
stay with the party whose ballot they
 
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:25.720 align:start position:0%
chose and I know that for me and for a
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
lot of people who I know um even if we
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
walk out of the voting room that day and
 
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
do not fill out the postcard that isn't
 
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
actually usually because we intended to
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
be members of that party it's actually
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
just because we completely forgot to
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
fill out the postcard um and so that's
 
00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
all right put it this
 
00:29:51.149 --> 00:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
calling can you hear me did you did you
 
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
do something differently because in the
 
00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
committee room your sound just changed I
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
don't know whether people online notice
 
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
that or not can I see any nods were
 
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
there any was there a change in her
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
volume for people online I'm seeing nods
 
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:08.200 align:start position:0%
yes so if you can unmute Miss colan
 
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
again that would be
 
00:30:10.679 --> 00:30:14.149 align:start position:0%
again that would be
great

00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
um I am unmuted can you hear me you're
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
better now you I I think you might not
 
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
have a great connection because you you
 
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
froze on the screen for a minute so just
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
be clearly so we can get you all okay
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry just let me know again if you
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
can't hear me I I was saying that
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
usually if we go out of the of the
 
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
ballot room without filling out the
 
00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
postcard it's because we forgot to fill
 
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
out the postcard it's not because we
 
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
intended to remain members of the party
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
in fact I think for the vast majority of
 
00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:52.029 align:start position:0%
in fact I think for the vast majority of
Undeclared

00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:52.039 align:start position:0%
Undeclared
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
voters I'm not sure they even realize
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
that they're registering with a party
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
when they take a ballot because we don't
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
feel a form that says I hereby register
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
with this party we just ask for the
 
00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
ballot that we want and so I think for a
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
lot of people they're not even clear
 
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
that when they walk out of that room
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
unless they fill out a card they have
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
now joined a party and so it makes it
 
00:31:14.669 --> 00:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
much much easier if we just return to
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
being Undeclared because that's probably
 
00:31:19.629 --> 00:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
what we want to be if we want to join a
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
Republican or a Democratic party we
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
would think that we would need to you
 
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
know go officially register with that
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
party with the with the town clerk so we
 
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
think it's a lot easier so we definitely
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
support this this just makes the process
 
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
a lot easier and as to the question as
 
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
to whether that's a burden on
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
the moderators to change it um I'm not
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
sure if it's actually changed for the
 
00:31:48.269 --> 00:31:48.279 align:start position:0%
party that day um it seems like we take
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
a ballot and then we fill out a postcard
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
on our way out the door and then I
 
00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
assume that that night or whatever they
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
go through and everyone who did not turn
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
in a postcard gets switched to the party
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
and everyone who did fill out the
 
00:32:06.629 --> 00:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
postcard gets you know is able to
 
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
maintain their status but I could be
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
wrong maybe that day they frantically
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
change everyone to democrat or
 
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
republican depending on which ballot
 
00:32:15.549 --> 00:32:15.559 align:start position:0%
they took and then they go through the
 
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
postcards and change everyone back but
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of assuming that they just
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
change everyone at the same time in
 
00:32:23.789 --> 00:32:23.799 align:start position:0%
which case there would be a whole host
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
of people they wouldn't have to really
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
officially change at least technically
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
with the computer if they if they just
 
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
automatically assume that everyone that
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
voted Undeclared wants to stay
 
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
Undeclared unless they purposely
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
register with the party
 
00:32:40.629 --> 00:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
so that's all I really had to say just
 
00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
that we support this bill makes it much
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
easier representative to roian thank you
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you Miss bman for
 
00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
taking the question are you aware
 
00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
whether or not this bill passes or not
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
you as a voter can contact the town
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
clerk the town you live at in any time
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not you got
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
change back you haven't you have the
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
that um I'm not sure if I understood
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
your question um but I'm assuming that
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know if if this if yes I am aware I
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
am aware that if I walk out without
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
filling out the postcard and I forgot I
 
00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
am aware that I can later go to the town
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
clerk and change it back I just know
 
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
that it's a lot easier if I purposely
 
00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
when I registered to vote I registered
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
Undeclared and so it's a lot easier for
 
00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:32.519 align:start position:0%
me to just assume I'm Undeclared I go
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
vote and I stay Undeclared unless I go
 
00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
purposely change it back um I'm also
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
aware that if this bill passes um you
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
know then I would just stay UND declared
 
00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
after I vote and then if I wanted to
 
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
join a party I could go to the town
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
clerk and and choose to join a
 
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:52.120 align:start position:0%
party thank you further questions for
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
committee members in the room
 
00:33:56.629 --> 00:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you m
 
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.629 --> 00:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
how much
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility themselves
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
term that you think it should be mainly
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
themselves oh I'm so sorry I just could
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
not understand the question really
 
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
clearly I'm sorry it's okay whose
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
primary responsibility is it for a voter
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
to determine their political affiliation
 
00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
the election officials or is it is ited
 
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
themselves not CED here based on the
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
testimony is where that responsible
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
lives well I mean I think it's it's the
 
00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the voters to
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
determine their affiliation um I think
 
00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
that this bill keeps it that way because
 
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:49.839 align:start position:0%
like I said um we've already determined
 
00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
that we want to be Undeclared and we
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
don't many of us don't really think of
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
it as joining a party when we pick a
 
00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
ballot even though that is technically
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
what we're doing and so we I we just
 
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
think that you know leave us the way we
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
are unless we purposely say we want to
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
join a
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
party thank you further questions from
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%

I'll be I'll be brief uh this bill
 
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
requires the Secretary of State to
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
highlight the maximum number of votes a
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
voter May cast for an office um it looks
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
as if this would just require uh the
 
00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
Secretary State shall highlight such
 
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
phrase using either a different font
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
color Watermark or other method at the
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
secretary's discretion uh and that's
 
00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
what's in the bill and and all I know of
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
it so I can take questions but that's no
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
you is there anybody in attendance who
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
bill any any panelists want to say
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
anything I am this is not the first time
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
that sponsor has not been here for the
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
legislation um in deference to the
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
unusual circumstances that we're running
 
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:20.200 align:start position:0%
this year I am asking somebody and I
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
don't care who the prime sponsor of the
 
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
bill is for somebody to bring it to the
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
floor um to give sponsors an opportunity
 
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
to contact us after after the fact to
 
00:37:32.829 --> 00:37:32.839 align:start position:0%
deal with it if it's appr
 
00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
translation um I recognize that in past
 
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances sometimes we have simply
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
let the bill with on the buy if nobody
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
comes to introduce us introduce it but
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
it requires a vote regardless so I my
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
choice is um to just get it on the floor
 
00:37:53.069 --> 00:37:53.079 align:start position:0%
regardless of the source and the
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
committee can then deal with it
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
as um so House Bill
 
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:01.720 align:start position:0%

00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
me Watermark is is a paper Maker's
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
device it doesn't I don't see how that
 
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
applies to this point bills Deputy scam
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
I'm here now thank you madam chair uh
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure exactly what the sponsor
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
means by Watermark I think that based on
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
the language in the bill it is just
 
00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
making a point to give the Secretary of
 
00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
State uh discretion in how uh the phrase
 
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
is highlighted you know whether it's a
 
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
different font color Watermark or other
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
method um the statutes generally give
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State the authority to
 
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
design the ballot uh within you know
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
some parameters that are established in
 
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:30.200 align:start position:0%
stat statute but uh I think that the
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor was probably just trying to make
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
all the options available uh to the
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
Secretary State to allow him or her to
 
00:39:41.069 --> 00:39:41.079 align:start position:0%
uh highlight that
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
phrase thank
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
bill oh I'm sorry
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
repres yeah thank you as long as we have
 
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
Deputy scandin here I'll ask I guess I'm
 
00:39:59.470 --> 00:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the reasoning
 
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
behind this bill what is the purpose of
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
it and why is it
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
needed uh that's a good question
 
00:40:08.349 --> 00:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
representative Lane I you know I I can
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
only speculate as to what the sponsor's
 
00:40:14.109 --> 00:40:14.119 align:start position:0%
intent might be but I have heard uh uh
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
legislators and others coming in the
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
office in the past uh just trying to
 
00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
suggest that the number of offices that
 
00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
can be voted on uh or the number of
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
candidates for a pro specific office to
 
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
be voted on is highlighted uh and
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
usually in multi-member districts uh
 
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
some of the large towns uh you know have
 
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
as many as 10 or 11 State Rep candidates
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
on the race um and the uh you know the
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
individuals that are concerned about
 
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
this just want to make sure that the
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
voter uh knows the number of options uh
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
that they have to vote for um that would
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
be my guess I'm not trying to speak for
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
the sponsor uh because I'm you know
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
again it's just speculation on my part
 
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
on what the sponsors
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
is could I have a followup
 
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
please if memory serves me correctly
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
isn't this already on the ballot I know
 
00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
it is here in conquer it's already said
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
how many you can vote
 
00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
for that's that that's true
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative Lane um I think what the
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
sponsors trying to do is highlight that
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
part of the ballot so where it says vote
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
for not more than three uh they want
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
that highlighted in either you know a
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
color or a larger font or something that
 
00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
makes that stand out to the
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
voter thank
 
00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
you any
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair I
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
have a question for Mr scalin are you
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
aware of any states that are doing this
 
00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
not of course Deputy scan prob isn't
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
aware of states that have districts for
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
nine or 10 Representatives either so I
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
representative yes another question
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh would it be
 
00:42:20.589 --> 00:42:20.599 align:start position:0%
difficult for your office to implement
 
00:42:22.549 --> 00:42:22.559 align:start position:0%
this in any
 
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
way uh that's a good question res Poma
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
Brian I I I think it would be difficult
 
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
it is just one more thing that we would
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
have to do in terms of Designing the
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
ballot New Hampshire does have one of
 
00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:38.839 align:start position:0%
the more complex ballots for State
 
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
elections used around the country just
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
because of the size of Our House of
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives for one thing and and
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
the number of offices that we elect and
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that it is it is a a
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
major project to design the ballots and
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
then proof them and even with all of the
 
00:42:59.710 --> 00:42:59.720 align:start position:0%
proofing that takes place uh you know we
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
always find uh an error somewhere and so
 
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
to the extent that you know we now have
 
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
to uh highlight a certain section of the
 
00:43:12.549 --> 00:43:12.559 align:start position:0%
ballot it it simply adds to that
 
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
complexity thank you further questions
 
00:43:16.349 --> 00:43:16.359 align:start position:0%
from people in the
 
00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much everybody

Hampton Falls and seab Brook um I'm
 
00:44:59.630 --> 00:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill House Bill 570
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
which would allow uh minor parties to be
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
recognized as such after they've uh had
 
00:45:10.349 --> 00:45:10.359 align:start position:0%
500 people from around the state uh go
 
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
in and register as members of that
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
particular party um the purpose of the
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill is in response to two things and
 
00:45:22.109 --> 00:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
it's in uh when we brought up ballot
 
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
access issues in the past members of
 
00:45:26.109 --> 00:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
this committee have said both in
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
hearings and in person um outside of
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
hearings that there really needs to be
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
some kind of a process for forming a
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
minor party Most states uh and I'm sure
 
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
somebody is going to send an email or uh
 
00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
testify how many states have minor
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
parties uh what's called minor party
 
00:45:46.589 --> 00:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
status New Hampshire we have you're
 
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
either a political organization or
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
you're a major party there's nothing in
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
between there's no uh stepping up
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
process you pretty much have all of the
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
minor parties have had a difficult time
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh trying to build up
 
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
membership because it's very very
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
difficult New Hampshire to get on the
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
ballot we one of the 10 most difficult
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
States for getting on the ballot um and
 
00:46:10.589 --> 00:46:10.599 align:start position:0%
you have to get 4% of the vote in um
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
only one of two Statewide offices either
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
Governor or Senate and um about onethird
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
of the time there isn't even a senate
 
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
race so in 2016 my gubernatorial
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
campaign broke some national records
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
for um
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
percentages um but also broke a
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
different record it was the first time
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
in over 20 years that the libertarian
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
party of New Hampshire had won over 4%
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
of the vote managed to get ballot access
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
but that was only for two years so the
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
libertarian party of New Hampshire and a
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
few other parties put their candidates
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
on for Statewide office in an attempt to
 
00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
get around the very very or bypass a
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
very difficult process that only minor
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
parties have to go through which is uh
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
gathering over 3,000 signatures which
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
means effectively they have to gather
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
over 6,000 signatures um which was very
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
difficult and I would argue dangerous to
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
do during the Corona virus um right
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
during the lockdown is when they were
 
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
when um the infection rates were highest
 
00:47:16.589 --> 00:47:16.599 align:start position:0%
um so that created a health hazard and
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office was
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
contacted and they said that they wanted
 
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:21.640 align:start position:0%
to do something about it but there
 
00:47:23.309 --> 00:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't anything in statute allowing them
 
00:47:25.549 --> 00:47:25.559 align:start position:0%
to do anything so we we we talked with
 
00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
them the the other issue and I would say
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
the bigger
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
issue is the actual processing of
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
ballots when I went and talked to uh my
 
00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:37.240 align:start position:0%
town clerk and when I spoke to other
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
Town clerks and city clerks in nsha and
 
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
Manchester um and people working in
 
00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:43.069 align:start position:0%
Manchester um and people working in
those

00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
offices uh there's about a one- Monon
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
period in August of election years where
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
they are they have stacks um I don't
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
have a I don't have a stack with me but
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's um
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
uh about this high for each stack in
 
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:03.640 align:start position:0%
cities like Manchester nsha um that they
 
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
have to go through for each campaign in
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
2016 I believe there were five or six
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
presidential campaigns and they all had
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
to go through the same
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
process and U we tried to estimate the
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
total cost um of processing all of these
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
um in terms of lost time lost hours and
 
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that they spend and
 
00:48:30.109 --> 00:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
when they're getting hit with that many
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
all at the same time uh a lot of towns
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
don't have the money in in their in
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
their budget to to put everyone on
 
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
overtime to do this so some of your some
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
of your uh smaller town governments have
 
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
outsized populations or uh in some cases
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
you have some towns where um they're
 
00:48:52.349 --> 00:48:52.359 align:start position:0%
getting a disproportionate number of
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
these nominating petitions coming in you
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
have to go through every single one
 
00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.230 align:start position:0%
have to go through every single one
meticulously

00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
meticulously
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
um and only about half get accepted as
 
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
valid so they have to go over every
 
00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
single line item and every address and
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
check each address that the voter puts
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
in and compare that with the record so
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
we spoke with the Secretary of State's
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
office about a number of different
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
Alternatives that are used and uh by far
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
the most coste effective is to Simply
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
have voters who want to be members of
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
third parties uh go into their town or
 
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
city clerk's office and when they go to
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
register to vote Just Right In in
 
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
whatever political party they'd like to
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
to be registered as and they would be
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
considered under this bill just
 
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
Undeclared so they could still vote in
 
00:49:40.349 --> 00:49:40.359 align:start position:0%
the state primary if they wanted so um
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
we did discuss this um for members who
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
are new to the committee we have
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
discussed this uh minor party question
 
00:49:48.789 --> 00:49:48.799 align:start position:0%
over the years there is something
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
different about this bill um compared to
 
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
other ballot access bills in that um
 
00:49:59.309 --> 00:49:59.319 align:start position:0%
a a minor party would not be a major
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
political party it would be something
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
that would simply hold its nominating
 
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:07.240 align:start position:0%
convention um I believe by the end of
 
00:50:10.789 --> 00:50:10.799 align:start position:0%
May or June before the filing period to
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
to turn all their candidates names in uh
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
but they wouldn't get access to
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
Congressional and legislative ballots
 
00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:19.240 align:start position:0%
they would be able to put their
 
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
presidential candidate on uh and vice
 
00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
presidential candidates on and those
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
candidates you know they won enough
 
00:50:28.789 --> 00:50:28.799 align:start position:0%
votes would count toward the
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
4% um although I I'm not sure that
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
that's ever happened I think maybe Gary
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
Johnson and Bill weld managed to get
 
00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.589 align:start position:0%
Johnson and Bill weld managed to get
4%

00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
4%
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
um but the the other thing is a minor
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
party would only be able to get on for
 
00:50:43.549 --> 00:50:43.559 align:start position:0%
things like County attorney County
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
Sheriff County Commissioner and a lot of
 
00:50:50.109 --> 00:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
uh uh City races if those are
 
00:50:53.309 --> 00:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
partisan um the thinking behind that is
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
if a race is going to be partisan
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
especially a local race
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
that um that gives a a party the the
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
chance to highlight how their party is
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
different dealing with let's say County
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
attorney um obviously the the
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
libertarian party and the veterans party
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
and the pirate party are very different
 
00:51:14.789 --> 00:51:14.799 align:start position:0%
from the Republican party in terms of
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
how they handle prosecution or the the
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
county sheriff's office um um they
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
address a lot of the their issues very
 
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
very differently from from the way
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
Republicans do or or even uh the green
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
party might want to uh the green party
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
wants to highlight how different they
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
are from the Democrats on a lot of
 
00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.109 align:start position:0%
are from the Democrats on a lot of
prosecutorial

00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial
 
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
issues um so there are a lot of County
 
00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
and local issues um that that they may
 
00:51:47.789 --> 00:51:47.799 align:start position:0%
want to highlight so the the
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
concern that um other members have
 
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
brought up that what happens if you have
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
you know three four five political
 
00:51:58.510 --> 00:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
parties uh in Congress or for State
 
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
Legislature could that just swing the
 
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
vote one way or the other and maybe um
 
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
issues of tactical voting and strategic
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
voting and isn't this going to influence
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
the outcome of uh legislative
 
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
races um while these political parties
 
00:52:17.069 --> 00:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
are gradually building and and getting
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
themselves set up um I I felt that that
 
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
for a minor party that there's a certain
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
growth phase and I think it makes sense
 
00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
for them to start at the the county
 
00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:29.559 align:start position:0%
local level for those partisan races and
 
00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:31.960 align:start position:0%
get themselves established that way to
 
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
see if there's a market or if there's an
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
interest um for that political party
 
00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:38.799 align:start position:0%
about 60% of Americans say that they
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
want a third party in American politics
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
um but so far none of the third
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
parties um other than maybe the Reform
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
Party has has been able to actually kind
 
00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
of Catch Fire and none of them have been
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
able to um kind of sustain through their
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
messaging um enough to kind of snowball
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
and uh get elected to hire
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
offices um so there there certainly are
 
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of minor parties out there right
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
now um apparently there are a couple of
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
others that are forming right now um
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
that are getting a little bit of news
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
coverage and uh I think that the process
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
the fair process would be for them to
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:38.589 --> 00:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
represent thank you madam chair thank
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
00:53:41.789 --> 00:53:41.799 align:start position:0%
question um so you mentioned this
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
nominating convention that a minor party
 
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
would be able to hold in order to
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
essentially nominate someone how many
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
people would need to be present at a
 
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:53.240 align:start position:0%
nominating Convention of a minor party
 
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question um originally
 
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
I'd intended to put a minimum number of
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
people in I
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
think um the previous version of this
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
bill was introduced as an amendment just
 
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
to another bill a couple of years ago
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
and I think that there was a number in
 
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
there something like a 100 people but I
 
00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:19.950 align:start position:0%
there something like a 100 people but I
I

00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:54:22.589 --> 00:54:22.599 align:start position:0%
um decided that if they had 500
 
00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
registered voters uh throughout the
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
state that that would probably be
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
sufficient and I I found that it would
 
00:54:32.309 --> 00:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
be um after talking to people it might
 
00:54:35.069 --> 00:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
be difficult to try to turn in a paper
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
that proves how many people attended
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
that nominating convention obviously if
 
00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
they they're turning in a dozen
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
candidates then they had at least a
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
dozen people present at the at their
 
00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
convention but if if the committee wants
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
to set a minimum number of 50 or 100
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
people or or or some other figure um
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
then I'm I'm fine with that I'm will
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
like I say with all my bills I'm willing
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
to amend it if the if the committee is
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
interested in um pursuing
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
this thank you representative Aon I
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
might just take issue with one just said
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
when you said if there are 12 people
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
nominated that means there are at least
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
12 people present I have at many
 
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
meetings where we have nominated people
 
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
for things that were not there so I
 
00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
would hope that political committee
 
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
meetings did not do that but um it does
 
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:25.720 align:start position:0%
happen so are there any other questions
 
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
from people well here in the room we
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
attending online for representative
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
anybody I think that a minor party would
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
have a hard time growing if they uh
 
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
tried nominating random people who
 
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
weren't even there there
 
00:55:50.349 --> 00:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
nominate I'm not see any for people
 
00:55:52.829 --> 00:55:52.839 align:start position:0%
attending to speak on this
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
bill all right I'm not seeing anybody
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
coming in this morning I'm going to
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on HB
 
00:56:06.829 --> 00:56:06.839 align:start position:0%
570 um the next item noticed for 10:30
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
and it is
 
00:56:12.029 --> 00:56:12.039 align:start position:0%
10 by
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.829 --> 00:56:24.839 align:start position:0%
rights the prime sponsor of this bill
 
00:56:36.029 --> 00:56:36.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
is that's right I'm sorry me you were
 
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
here in the building I'm just not used
 
00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
hand thank
 
00:56:55.789 --> 00:56:55.799 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair this is my
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
first time presenting a bill um in this
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
so great um thank you madam chair and
 
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for your time
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
and opportunity to introduce House Bill
 
00:57:13.549 --> 00:57:13.559 align:start position:0%
555 for the record my name is Andrew
 
00:57:16.109 --> 00:57:16.119 align:start position:0%
Balon and I represent Manchester Ward
 
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
five this bill is a repeat of a bill
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
which this committee saw last year it
 
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
passed the committee with a broad
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
bipartisan vote and passed the house on
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
a Voice vote
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
like most other bills last year however
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
it got Co and died in the Senate I'd
 
00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:33.799 align:start position:0%
like to start by saying that this bill
 
00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
does not create any rights if you just
 
00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
read the title of the bill you might
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
think we're looking to make some major
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
changes here but I assure you it's much
 
00:57:43.789 --> 00:57:43.799 align:start position:0%
more boring than that we're not
 
00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:45.400 align:start position:0%
expanding the right to vote with this
 
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
bill at
 
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
all earlier today I sent an email to the
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
committee with a packet of information
 
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
which you will find helpful in
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
evaluating this bill in this packet you
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
will find a copy of RSA 654 2-a titled
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
voters confined in Peno
 
00:58:05.309 --> 00:58:05.319 align:start position:0%
institutions this current law states
 
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
that a person behind bars can vote by
 
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot the only time an
 
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
individual's right to vote is lost is
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
when they are serving t for a felony
 
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
conviction which is addressed in rsa's
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
654 col 5 and 607a col 2 which I've also
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
included in the emailed packet so if
 
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
you're behind bars a waiting trial or if
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
you're behind bars because you were
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
convicted of a misdemeanor and are
 
00:58:32.109 --> 00:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
serving time you are still legally
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
eligible to vote in New Hampshire and
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
this bill as I stated previously doesn't
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
affect that at all the issue arises when
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
you actually try to request an absentee
 
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
ballot it doesn't affect everybody but
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
it does affect a significant portion of
 
00:58:46.079 --> 00:58:47.349 align:start position:0%
it does affect a significant portion of
the

00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
population I'll use myself and Madam
 
00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
chair as an example if the two of us got
 
00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
arrested together and we were
 
00:58:56.349 --> 00:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
incarcerated at Valley Street jail and
 
00:58:59.069 --> 00:58:59.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
ising and we were incarcerated at Valley
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
Street jail in Manchester with an
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
election coming up only one of us would
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
be able to vote uh I'm sorry only one of
 
00:59:10.109 --> 00:59:10.119 align:start position:0%
us would be able to fill out the
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot application and vote in
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
the election when you look at the
 
00:59:17.309 --> 00:59:17.319 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot application form section
 
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
two lists the reasons that you may be
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
entitled to vote by absentee ballot and
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
obviously you must select one of those
 
00:59:26.349 --> 00:59:26.359 align:start position:0%
reasons well remember that madam shair
 
00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
and I are in jail together and we're
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
trying to fill this form out there's an
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
option that states I plan to be absent
 
00:59:34.349 --> 00:59:34.359 align:start position:0%
on the day of the election from the city
 
00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
town or unincorporated place where I am
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
domiciled that's the most popular option
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
on this forum and Madam chair you would
 
00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:43.880 align:start position:0%
be able to use that option because you
 
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
are domiciled in gtown and were
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
currently in jail in Manchester but I
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
could not use that option because I am
 
00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
domiciled in Manchester which happens to
 
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
be where the jail is and since I'm still
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
in Manchester I'm certainly not absent
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
from the city and obviously none of the
 
01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
other options apply to my situation so
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
there's a clear problem
 
01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
here if however I am brave enough to
 
01:00:09.549 --> 01:00:09.559 align:start position:0%
submit false information on that form
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
and I actually get a ballot in the mail
 
01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:13.880 align:start position:0%
it comes with a voter affidavit that I
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
have to fill out which is on page six of
 
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
your emailed packet this form is even
 
01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:21.559 align:start position:0%
worse because the affidavit requires me
 
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
to swear under the penalties of voter
 
01:00:26.109 --> 01:00:26.119 align:start position:0%
fraud that I will be absent from the
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
town or city that I'm domiciled in on
 
01:00:31.029 --> 01:00:31.039 align:start position:0%
Election Day now I have to make a sworn
 
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
statement and of course you can see the
 
01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
Bold text at the bottom there that
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
indicates that providing a false that
 
01:00:39.309 --> 01:00:39.319 align:start position:0%
providing false information when voting
 
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
is a class A misdemeanor with a maximum
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
sentence of a year in jail and a $2,000
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
fine and of course I'm starting to think
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
that this voting absentee thing isn't
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
really worth the potential to spend yet
 
01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
another year in jail so House Bill 555
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
fixes all of this it's simply adds a
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
checkbox to the application form and
 
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
language to the sworn statement in the
 
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
affidavit for individuals who are
 
01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
incarcerated pre-trial or serving time
 
01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.549 align:start position:0%
incarcerated pre-trial or serving time
for

01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor I did speak with uh deputy
 
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
secretary of state scanon about this
 
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
bill last year and he said that they
 
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
agree that this is an issue and they are
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
open to adding the language this
 
01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:19.720 align:start position:0%
concludes my testimony on house build
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
555 again I thank the committee for your
 
01:01:23.029 --> 01:01:23.039 align:start position:0%
time and I'm willing to take any
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
questions you have thank you
 
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative you before I take
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
questions could you refresh our memory
 
01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
as to what the house bill number was
 
01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.470 align:start position:0%
as to what the house bill number was
last

01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
year um I don't have any information I
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
can send it to the comme once I look up
 
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
to the elction for session of I think
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
was in the second year so if you look up
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
election I I think it might be 1751 if I
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
remember correctly okay in the second
 
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
year um questions for representative
 
01:01:59.230 --> 01:01:59.240 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee represent
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
McDonald MK represent question do you
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
have any idea of how many people might
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
be affected by this in a given year are
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
there any statistics on this uh I do not
 
01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
have any statistics for this however I
 
01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
would assume that anyone who is
 
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:19.240 align:start position:0%
domiciled in Manchester who happens to
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
be arrested uh or serving time for a
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor in the Valley Street jail
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
for example uh would certainly be
 
01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
affected I I think that number is quite
 
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
large questions
 
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
MERS any questions from
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
representa thank you madam chair I'm
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
proud to say that I have never spent any
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
time in
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
jail hypothetically or
 
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise but I enjoyed your little um
 
01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
thanks well you know things can get idea
 
01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
so that that was fun um but what would
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
happen if a person is in a
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
jail and they request the and I know
 
01:03:10.109 --> 01:03:10.119 align:start position:0%
they don't spend a lot of time in jail
 
01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
often times spend just a few days um
 
01:03:15.069 --> 01:03:15.079 align:start position:0%
what would happen if the ballot is
 
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
delivered to the jail and that and at
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
that point the inmate is gone back to
 
01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:21.029 align:start position:0%
that point the inmate is gone back to
their

01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
home uh thank you very much for the
 
01:03:26.029 --> 01:03:26.039 align:start position:0%
question um I do want to point out that
 
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
this also applies to people who are
 
01:03:29.309 --> 01:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
serving time for a MISD demor which
 
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
could be up to a year in jail so so for
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
those people I think that wouldn't be an
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
issue um for people who are only going
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
to be in jail for a short time that's
 
01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:38.839 align:start position:0%
something that they might be aware of
 
01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
and they may not request the absentee
 
01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
ballot application for the absentee
 
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
ballot if they do get out of jail you
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
know unexpectedly uh they can uh contact
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
their city clerk to update their address
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
and have their absentee ballot uh either
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
resent or or sent to their their home
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
address they also have the option uh
 
01:04:00.029 --> 01:04:00.039 align:start position:0%
anyone who does not or anyone who
 
01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
requests an absentee ballot who chooses
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
not to fill out the ballot can show up
 
01:04:08.029 --> 01:04:08.039 align:start position:0%
at the polling place and um and just
 
01:04:11.829 --> 01:04:11.839 align:start position:0%
vote like a normal uh individual
 
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
would question
 
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
represent thank you madam chair uh how
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
did you become aware of this issue do
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
you have any real people that you have
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
spoken to who have brought this to your
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
attention because it affected them
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question um while I
 
01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
didn't run into anyone uh who were
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
specifically affected by this issue I
 
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
did run into a number of people during
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
my campaign who believed that they were
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
not eligible to vote because they were
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
felons um and I informed them uh after
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
doing some research that once you've
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
served your time as a felon you you do
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
have your rights restored it was during
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
that time during that research that I
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
found that um voters who are
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
incarcerated can vote absentee and
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's something that I didn't uh I
 
01:05:03.309 --> 01:05:03.319 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that they could and so I
 
01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
I wondered how many people actually take
 
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
uh take advantage of that and I started
 
01:05:10.269 --> 01:05:10.279 align:start position:0%
to look into it and I kind of put myself
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
in their position not physically
 
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
obviously um and I looked at the forms
 
01:05:18.029 --> 01:05:18.039 align:start position:0%
and I realized that I I realized that
 
01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
that this problem exists and that I
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
myself if I was arrested would not be
 
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
able to uh legally exercise my right to
 
01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
vote under the circumstances
 
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative B yes thank you
 
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
madam chairman um representative my m i
 
01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
I do remember the bill from last session
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
it was actually House Bill 1651 so you
 
01:05:40.829 --> 01:05:40.839 align:start position:0%
were close when you said
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
1751 um and I'm looking at page two line
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
23 of the bill which states as one of
 
01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
the check off points I am confined in a
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
penal Institution for a misdemeanor or
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
while awaiting trial and that's the
 
01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
exact same language that was used last
 
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
session um but I'm looking at it now and
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering is it conceivable that
 
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
someone could be confined in a penal
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
Institution for a felony and also a
 
01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:09.789 align:start position:0%
Institution for a felony and also a
waiting

01:06:09.789 --> 01:06:09.799 align:start position:0%
waiting
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
trial and like this is an either or
 
01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
situation I'm I'm wondering if there's
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
going to be word smithing that might
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
need to be done for
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
this uh thank you for the question what
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
what I think you're saying I just want
 
01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
to clarify are you're saying somebody
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
who's a accused of a felony who's being
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
held pre-trial like for for murder or
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
whatever no actually I'm what I'm saying
 
01:06:35.069 --> 01:06:35.079 align:start position:0%
is let's say someone has already been
 
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
convicted of a felony he is serving time
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
for a felony but he's also awaiting
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
trial for some other um reason and where
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
this is an either or U scenario in line
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
23 they could say well I'm a waiting
 
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
trial therefore I'm entitled to an
 
01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.269 align:start position:0%
trial therefore I'm entitled to an
absentee

01:06:53.269 --> 01:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
absentee
 
01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
ballot sure thank you very much for the
 
01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
question um I I do see what you're
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
saying however I would point out that um
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
felons do not have the right to vote
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
regardless of what options may or may
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
not uh present themselves on this on
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
this forum um we could say the same
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
thing if a felon uh was currently in
 
01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
jail uh in a in a town that they weren't
 
01:07:20.589 --> 01:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
um domiciled in they could say well I'm
 
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
certainly going to be absent so I think
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
I can I can apply I I'm certainly open
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
to amending the language to make it more
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
clear for sure okay thank you very much
 
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
that was my only question but it follow
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
up to that question representative H
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
um it would appear that the language
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
fixed for that which might be duplicate
 
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
to the law would be or or waiting trial
 
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
and I am not a convicted felon but
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
arguably under that circumstance
 
01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:53.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you add that to every exclusion
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
and I am not a convicted fell
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
right I mean because somebody's in jail
 
01:07:58.319 --> 01:07:59.510 align:start position:0%
right I mean because somebody's in jail
doesn't

01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
mean I can be a convicted felon
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
and be
 
01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
absent I could be absent from I could
 
01:08:10.589 --> 01:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
have been convicted of the felony
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
released you're still in jail for
 
01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:15.880 align:start position:0%

for B because I a convicted I didn't say
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
that very well but I think it's a little
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%

in attendance could you raise your hand
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um welcome to the
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
committee you and you have been and if
 
01:09:29.309 --> 01:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
hello committee members um my name is Ka
 
01:09:33.789 --> 01:09:33.799 align:start position:0%
Randolph and I am submitting testimony
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the New Hampshire High
 
01:09:36.829 --> 01:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
School Democrats and the New Hampshire
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
young Democrats I am testifying in
 
01:09:42.269 --> 01:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
support of HB 555 because this should
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
not be a partisan issue past legislation
 
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
grants Prisoners the right to vote
 
01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:48.759 align:start position:0%
therefore the debate around this bill is
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
not whether or not prisoners should be
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote but instead if we would
 
01:09:54.269 --> 01:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
like to make democracy accessible for
 
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
all eligible particip an do we want
 
01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
people's voices to be heard or should we
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
be complicit in allowing this problem to
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
exist this bill makes it clear on
 
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots that prisoners are
 
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote it allows for prisoners
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
to accurately describe their
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances on absentee ballots
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
addressing an issue of unclear or false
 
01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
information there are no drawbacks
 
01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
besides an extra two Clauses having to
 
01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
be printed and the benefits include
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
giving eligible citizens a role in
 
01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
choosing their representatives
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
supporting our democracy and upholding
 
01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
their right to vote this concludes my
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
testimony the benefits of this bill
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
clearly outweigh the costs I implore you
 
01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:34.520 align:start position:0%

housekeeping bill um we testified in
 
01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:25.950 align:start position:0%

uh of hb1 1651 last session and so we're

thrilled to be back before you uh this
 
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:33.640 align:start position:0%
year as the prime sponsor did a great
 
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
job explaining this bill um so I'll just
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
reiterate um that this bill does not
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
expand voter eligibility were this bill
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
to be enacted no individual would be
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote who is currently unable
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
to nor would anybody be allowed to vote
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
absentee who is currently unable to so
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
it's not about changing eligibility it's
 
01:11:58.510 --> 01:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
just about clarifying absentee ballot
 
01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
forms and making sure that people who
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
are eligible to vote can accurately fill
 
01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
out absentee ballot forms both the
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
request form uh and the affidavit form
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to note the people who
 
01:12:14.629 --> 01:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
are detained pre-trial in particular
 
01:12:16.629 --> 01:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
could be released back into their
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
Community um any day including shortly
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
after an election if charges are dropped
 
01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
or if they're found not guilty and
 
01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
people jailed on a misdemeanor will
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
return to their community in the near
 
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
future it's in our Collective best
 
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
interest to make sure that people who
 
01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
are released are able to successfully
 
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
re-enter their community and part of
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
that is ensuring that they re they
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
retain ties to their Community such as
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
Civic engagement achieved through the
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
active voting so we really do think it's
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
important that people who are eligible
 
01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
to vote are able to do so um and so
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
again this is just a housekeeping
 
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
measure that makes sure that eligible
 
01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
voters are able to vote at
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to answer any
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for joining USC to
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
the elction for this year the person
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
we've heard from any questions from any
 
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
roomes thank you
 
01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
um Madam and thank you for testifying I
 
01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
just had a quick which is a question
 
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
which is do you by chance know the
 
01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:31.960 align:start position:0%
average wait time for for bookings in
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
like place like Valley Street um where a
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
lot of people get
 
01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
held uh I I will I'm not sure what the
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
average time is I will say it has
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
certainly extended during covid there
 
01:13:45.629 --> 01:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
are very very few trials happening right
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
now um and so for people who are being
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
detained pre-trial their weight is
 
01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
likely to be significantly longer given
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
current circumstances
 
01:13:58.270 --> 01:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
can I follow up M chair follow up
 
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
representative you and so in theory yeah
 
01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
somebody could miss out on an election
 
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
um um would you would you agree with
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
that um yeah oh absolutely um and I and
 
01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
I would just know um yes people can be
 
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
absent during an election in response to
 
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
one of the questions previously asked
 
01:14:19.709 --> 01:14:19.719 align:start position:0%
about that you know if you're detained
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
for instance in July or August and
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
you're not sure if you're still going to
 
01:14:26.189 --> 01:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
be detained in November um you know you
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
can certainly still request an absentee
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
ballot form and then if you're released
 
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
in time you get to go vote in person um
 
01:14:35.229 --> 01:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
but if you're not you have the form um
 
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
there were a number of people last year
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
right who requested absentee ballot
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
forms um and then chose to vote in
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
person in the end because they were able
 
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
to they felt safe enough to do so um so
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
we we don't think that this impedes
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
people from voting who may get released
 
01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
right before an
 
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
election thank you thank you
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%

01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
folks have said I was um I wasn't clear
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
on all the nuances of voting rights
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire I've just come to
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
live here in the last year and a half
 
01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
but I think what the high school
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
students said and also um is important
 
01:15:46.679 --> 01:15:48.070 align:start position:0%
students said and also um is important
about

01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
clarifying um to all in incarcerated
 
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
people what um their rights their
 
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
abilities are to obtain the absentee
 
01:15:58.629 --> 01:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
ballot is very important and also we
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
have to remember these folks are still
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
paying taxes so we do want to clarify um
 
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
their accessibility to to vote because
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%

going to make have been covered so I
 
01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
just will say that I am fully in support
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
of this um of this piece of legislation
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's based primarily on conversations
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
I've had with
 
01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
people in my door-to-door canvasing who
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
um who had believed that they like the
 
01:17:35.629 --> 01:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
sponsor who encountered people who
 
01:17:38.629 --> 01:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
belied that they were not able to vote
 
01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
because of their convictions their prior
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
convictions and seeing the Joy on
 
01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:47.239 align:start position:0%
people's faces when they realized that
 
01:17:50.430 --> 01:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
in fact they could participate once
 
01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
again in Civic
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
engagement um it just shows me that you
 
01:17:59.790 --> 01:17:59.800 align:start position:0%

01:18:01.199 --> 01:18:02.709 align:start position:0%
lived
experiences

01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
experiences
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
um the right to vote is something that
 
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
we we value tremendously and making that
 
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
clear to people even in their lowest
 
01:18:16.629 --> 01:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
moments in time um that we still value
 
01:18:19.629 --> 01:18:19.639 align:start position:0%
their voice I think is really important
 
01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:22.520 align:start position:0%

to the the members of the committee for
 
01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
for hearing HB
 
01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
551 um my name is representative Jim
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
kofalt I represent Hillsboro District 4

which uh includes Wilton lineboro
 
01:28:18.189 --> 01:28:18.199 align:start position:0%
Greenville and
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
francistown um this uh I I think we
 
01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
would all agree that transparency is
 
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
really foundational to good government
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh for over 50 years our state has
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
enshrined that principle under RSA 91a
 
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
which is uh probably the best known RSA
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
in uh in the state of New
 
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and there's good reason for
 
01:28:44.709 --> 01:28:44.719 align:start position:0%
that uh meaningful citizen participation
 
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
rests on the Public's ability to access
 
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
information um over and over again uh
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the past uh Century we have
 
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
seen sit situations where waste Fraud
 
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
and Abuse were exposed because of
 
01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
people's ability to access public
 
01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
information U through right to know or
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
at the federal level through the Freedom
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
of Information
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
Act current law says that uh the
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
Statewide voter database is private and
 
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
confidential um elsewhere it uh it says
 
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise because the the Statewide
 
01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
voter database in fact is not act
 
01:29:26.270 --> 01:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
private and conf
 
01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
confidential um RSA 654 section 31
 
01:29:33.189 --> 01:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
states that the Statewide voter database
 
01:29:35.189 --> 01:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
will be made available to political
 
01:29:37.149 --> 01:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
parties candidates and political
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
committees for a
 
01:29:43.070 --> 01:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
fee uh in addition to that anyone who
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
wants to get their Town's uh voter list
 
01:29:49.709 --> 01:29:49.719 align:start position:0%
or a towns a city or Town's voter list
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh can do so it's not private
 
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
information uh it's it is however
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
inconvenient um there is generally a fee
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
involved um it may be provided sometimes
 
01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
in hard copy uh which usually you know
 
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
consumes quite a lot of paper and uh and
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
time to assemble I would think uh and it
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
could be provided in electronic
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
format um so the state has the full list
 
01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:21.310 align:start position:0%
format um so the state has the full list
and

01:30:21.310 --> 01:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative kofalt we just lost
 
01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:26.550 align:start position:0%
uh representative kofalt we just lost
your

01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
audio not private representative copal
 
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
we just lost your audio for a minute so
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
if you could just back up a bit in your
 
01:30:37.709 --> 01:30:37.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
great there's a great deal
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
of Representative copal we are not
 
01:30:44.639 --> 01:30:45.709 align:start position:0%
of Representative copal we are not
hearing

01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:30:50.990 --> 01:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
connection representative coal are you
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
hearing can you go on video please
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt I have no idea if
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
me these
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
packs I am not hearing you your
 
01:31:09.629 --> 01:31:09.639 align:start position:0%
connection is not good you are going in
 
01:31:09.639 --> 01:31:10.910 align:start position:0%
connection is not good you are going in
and

01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
out can you change to
 
01:31:18.430 --> 01:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
video um changing to video will likely
 
01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:22.119 align:start position:0%
make the problem worse um if it is
 
01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
acceptable I will uh I will will switch
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
to phone audio which I think I can do
 
01:31:29.109 --> 01:31:29.119 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly would you prefer that
 
01:31:31.629 --> 01:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
actually just come back on very clearly
 
01:31:33.229 --> 01:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what was going on there
 
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
for a minute okay um I apologize for
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
that um I'll I'll try to get through
 
01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
this quickly so um you know I guess the
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that um ordinary
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
citizens who who want access to what is
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
and should be public information are at
 
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
a disadvantage um they don't have the
 
01:31:57.390 --> 01:31:57.400 align:start position:0%
Deep Pockets to uh to to Fork out $8,000
 
01:31:58.270 --> 01:31:58.280 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:32:01.629 --> 01:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
list um as I said the list is not
 
01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
private or confidential um the uh the
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
state does get about $100,000 a year on
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
average 90% of which goes to cities and
 
01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
towns but if you uh if you do uh some
 
01:32:17.550 --> 01:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
very simple math that's an average of
 
01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:18.709 align:start position:0%
very simple math that's an average of
about

01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
$385 per city or town per year um
 
01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
but putting that aside I would say that
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
we don't charge for other government
 
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
records so it seems
 
01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
um seems inconsistent that we would
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
charge for this um I would also uh cite
 
01:32:43.109 --> 01:32:43.119 align:start position:0%
part one article 8 of the New Hampshire
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
Constitution which states that uh
 
01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
government should be open accessible
 
01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:52.040 align:start position:0%
accountable and responsive to that end
 
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
the Public's right of access to
 
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
governmental proceedings and Records
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
shall not be unreasonably
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
restricted um so for this reason I ask
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
you to uh to support HB 551 with a
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation of to
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
pass great thank you very much
 
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
representative and you and your your
 
01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
voice came in just fine after
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
there is there anybody present in the
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
room representative thank you madam
 
01:33:26.669 --> 01:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question in your
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
presentation my question is on the last
 
01:33:32.910 --> 01:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
line there of the bill line
 
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
23 do you have an example of where could
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
interest thank you representative Mooney
 
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
yes um there are some people who have a
 
01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
restraining order in effect against a
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
stalker or an an abusive uh
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
partner and uh have a compelling reason
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
to not have their information disclosed
 
01:34:07.390 --> 01:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
on a public list so um so I believe that
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
there are uh limited cases that would be
 
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
um decided at the discretion of the
 
01:34:15.709 --> 01:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State um where there is a
 
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
compelling interest to not reveal uh the
 
01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
the location uh or address of such
 
01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:24.149 align:start position:0%
the location uh or address of such
people

01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative bers
 
01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman uh
 
01:34:33.229 --> 01:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
representative in your testimony you
 
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
were talking about access to the voter
 
01:34:38.189 --> 01:34:38.199 align:start position:0%
checklist but the bill talks about
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
providing access to the voter database
 
01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:43.400 align:start position:0%
the database is a lot more complex than
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
just the checklist uh it it it's really
 
01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
the software that is interacting with
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
the end users the applications the
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
capturing of data the queries and so on
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
is is your intent that the public should
 
01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
have free access to the code that's
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
behind the data that's being provided on
 
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:00.950 align:start position:0%
behind the data that's being provided on
the

01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
checklist it it is not and I apologize
 
01:35:06.990 --> 01:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
for my imprecise language I am referring
 
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
to the data
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
itself um and if need be we can clean up
 
01:35:14.350 --> 01:35:14.360 align:start position:0%
the language to uh to make that clear
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
today if one is to purchase the
 
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide voter database um I believe
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
that that is provided in the form of um
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
a series of Excel or CSV
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
files um it includes information such as
 
01:35:36.270 --> 01:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
uh name address voting history and so
 
01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
forth It's actually
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
defined uh the the contents of the
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:48.030 --> 01:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
6543 uh but the the intention really is
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
to make
 
01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
available uh to the public that which is
 
01:35:54.669 --> 01:35:54.679 align:start position:0%
currently available
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh for for people who can afford to
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
spend $8,000 on
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
chairman uh and then as a followup to
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
that how come you chose not to repeal
 
01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
the fee structure that appears in 655 31
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh it does say that these checklists
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
shall be provided to any person
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
requesting the copies um you know in
 
01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
your Statute in your bill you're saying
 
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
there's no fee but you haven't removed
 
01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
law should it be um yeah I it I think I
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
I think it should be yes um and and I
 
01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
will uh I I will add that I actually
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
think that there there may be
 
01:36:44.910 --> 01:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
another provision that needs to be
 
01:36:48.910 --> 01:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
changed which is uh or or clarified
 
01:36:59.070 --> 01:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative again in the
 
01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna ask him to call back in if he
 
01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
has more that he wants to say on to
 
01:37:36.030 --> 01:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
another attendee and Deputy SC unless
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
you have a specific question I'll
 
01:37:39.870 --> 01:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
probably wait till the end to recognize
 
01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:44.350 align:start position:0%
probably wait till the end to recognize
you

01:37:44.350 --> 01:37:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:51.109 align:start position:0%
 
onent

01:37:51.109 --> 01:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
onent
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%

out it sounds like I'm back now audio
 
01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
did go out so um why don't you if you
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
want to call back in if you want to add
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
to your testimony I'm gonna go on to uh
 
01:38:06.719 --> 01:38:08.750 align:start position:0%
to your testimony I'm gonna go on to uh
representative

01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
organ St is going to speak to the bill
 
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
and that should give you time to call
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
back in and we'll go back to you to see
 
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
what you want to add at that all right
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
very good thank you thank you
 
01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
first time into that the best we
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
can are us I understand you would like
 
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
to speak to House Bill
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
551 yeah I'm I'm I'm against uh I mean I
 
01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
think I'm against passing it uh passing
 
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
it at this time I the basic idea may
 
01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
have some Merit um but it's probably not
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be done uh this
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
year while we have limited uh capacity
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
here in the house um
 
01:38:58.270 --> 01:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
I mostly raised my hand um to correct
 
01:39:00.030 --> 01:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
something that that I thought I heard
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
the previous member said which was that
 
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh government records are should always
 
01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
be provided free there are a number of
 
01:39:10.750 --> 01:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
valid cases uh why uh why the government
 
01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
can charge uh a fee for certain for
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
certain records and I case of the voter
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
database that uh there's probably I
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
think there's probably a good
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
justification for it um we'll certainly
 
01:39:27.070 --> 01:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
hear a lot about it um we'll probably
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
hear a good explanation from secretary
 
01:39:30.589 --> 01:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
scandin if he chooses to speak but
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
there's a number of there's a there's a
 
01:39:35.790 --> 01:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
number of areas uh there's a number of
 
01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
areas where the government charges for
 
01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
for uh for for records and as um course
 
01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
you know better than most of us Madam
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
chairman because you served on the
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee which deals with the
 
01:39:48.589 --> 01:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
right to no law and there are so the
 
01:39:51.589 --> 01:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
U and of course if we gave away all
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
government records for free that would
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
 lot of functions of government
 
01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
um such as the registry of deeds but
 
01:39:59.470 --> 01:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a topic for another bill
 
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
and another committee so anyway I I'm I
 
01:40:04.589 --> 01:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill and I think I thought
 
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
there was an assertion made in the
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
represent kof's testimony that that was
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
incorrect so I just thought I'd try to
 
01:40:12.589 --> 01:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
correct it so thank you very much Madam
 
01:40:13.950 --> 01:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
chair that's about all I have to say
 
01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:16.719 align:start position:0%
about this so thank you does anybody
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
have any questions for
 
01:40:25.149 --> 01:40:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so thanks thank
 
01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:35.550 align:start position:0%
 
again

01:40:35.550 --> 01:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:40.080 align:start position:0%

01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%

us I'm here Madam chair thank you um
 
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
Madam chair members of the committee I'm
 
01:40:52.990 --> 01:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
David scanland deputy secretary of state
 
01:40:55.870 --> 01:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
um here in opposition to the bill as it
 
01:40:58.589 --> 01:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
is written um I would agree with
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
represent berson's uh uh interpretation
 
01:41:06.270 --> 01:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
of what this bill does is um it makes
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
available the entire database uh of the
 
01:41:11.709 --> 01:41:11.719 align:start position:0%
registered voters in New Hampshire and
 
01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
all of the information that goes along
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
with that um we were required under the
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
help America vote act that passed um uh
 
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
back in 200
 
01:41:25.350 --> 01:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh I think it was 2003 somewhere around
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
there 2002 to uh along with every other
 
01:41:30.270 --> 01:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
state in the country that did not
 
01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
already have one to create a centralized
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
Statewide voter database and that uh
 
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
those databases were required to have
 
01:41:41.550 --> 01:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
certain information in them which
 
01:41:43.709 --> 01:41:43.719 align:start position:0%
includes things like not only the
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
voter's name and address uh but birth
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
dates um last four digits of social
 
01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
security numbers driver's license
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
numbers uh natural calization
 
01:41:56.709 --> 01:41:56.719 align:start position:0%
information uh along with many other
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
things um when the state legislature uh
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
decided to go ahead and create the
 
01:42:07.470 --> 01:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
database uh it was a matter of policy to
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
keep uh as much of that private
 
01:42:13.229 --> 01:42:13.239 align:start position:0%
information of the voters private and so
 
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
the law was written the way that uh that
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
it was written I can tell you that uh
 
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
when voters believe that private
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
information from the datab base has
 
01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:26.719 align:start position:0%
gotten out uh and we have done a
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
fantastic job protecting that
 
01:42:32.510 --> 01:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
information uh they get upset and um you
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
know we frequently get calls from
 
01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
voters uh you know saying how did you
 
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
get my phone number well um those phone
 
01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
numbers come from actually other other
 
01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
lists uh that are put together out there
 
01:42:47.390 --> 01:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
because the state does not collect that
 
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
that type of information whenever we
 
01:42:52.109 --> 01:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
participated in the interstate cross
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
check program
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
we agreed to provide the public part of
 
01:42:57.119 --> 01:42:57.830 align:start position:0%
we agreed to provide the public part of
the

01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:01.229 --> 01:43:01.239 align:start position:0%
checklist um to the to the federal
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
government to uh um you know conduct
 
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
that match many voters believing that
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
their private information uh was at
 
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
stake certainly let us know about their
 
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
concern in that regard uh even though it
 
01:43:16.830 --> 01:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
was not being made
 
01:43:19.870 --> 01:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
available um to get to representative
 
01:43:23.310 --> 01:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
kofalt Bill and based on his testimony
 
01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like he's talking about
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
the public part of the checklist which
 
01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
is made available uh to candidates uh
 
01:43:34.830 --> 01:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
political parties and political
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
committees the state is the state can
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
only sell a Statewide list to a
 
01:43:44.430 --> 01:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
candidate running for office a political
 
01:43:47.229 --> 01:43:47.239 align:start position:0%
party or a political committee that's
 
01:43:49.470 --> 01:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
registered in New Hampshire and the
 
01:43:51.390 --> 01:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
information that we are allowed to
 
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
provide is simply the voter's name
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh both their mailing and physical
 
01:43:57.790 --> 01:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
address uh and their party
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
affiliation and in the Statewide list we
 
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
can provide voter history for the last
 
01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:03.470 align:start position:0%
can provide voter history for the last
two

01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
years any voter any person actually they
 
01:44:08.350 --> 01:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
don't have to be a voter but any person
 
01:44:12.109 --> 01:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
can go to the town uh and and obtain the
 
01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
checklist for that town the public
 
01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
checklist which contains the information
 
01:44:20.350 --> 01:44:20.360 align:start position:0%
that I just mentioned um for a fee and I
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
believe the fee is $25 for the first
 
01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
1,500 names and then it's 50 cents per
 
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
thousand names after
 
01:44:30.629 --> 01:44:30.639 align:start position:0%
that um the reason that there is a fee
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
charg is because the supervisors of the
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
checklist in each town and the board of
 
01:44:38.189 --> 01:44:38.199 align:start position:0%
registrars in each city are the
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
individuals that actually maintain the
 
01:44:42.030 --> 01:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
list they are the only ones that can add
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
names to a list that can take names off
 
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
the list and uh and there is an effort
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
involved in doing that and so the $25
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
fee for for obtaining a checklist at the
 
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
local level is to help con compensate
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
them for that uh for that effort the
 
01:45:01.390 --> 01:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
monies that we collect at the state
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
level the
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
$8,000 I think I think it's around
 
01:45:09.390 --> 01:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
$8,400 now to purchase a Statewide list
 
01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
is uh also recognizing the effort on the
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
part of the town because all but $500 of
 
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
that amount get sent back to the cities
 
01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
and towns uh uh at the same level the
 
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
town or the city would have collected uh
 
01:45:28.990 --> 01:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
if if that same list was sold locally so
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's the reason the fiscal note you
 
01:45:34.589 --> 01:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
see $9,000 of the roughly $100,000 that
 
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
we collect in a year is uh is given back
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
to the cities and towns to help
 
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
compensate them for the effort that goes
 
01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
into maintaining the
 
01:45:47.229 --> 01:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
list also the Statewide database is
 
01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
dynamic it changes by the minute it is
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's con constantly receiving
 
01:45:56.669 --> 01:45:56.679 align:start position:0%
information uh information is being
 
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
updated by the supervisors of the
 
01:46:01.109 --> 01:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
checklist again names added names being
 
01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
removed along with all of the
 
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
confidential private information that
 
01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
goes along with that so um uh you know
 
01:46:12.510 --> 01:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's not certainly it's not static
 
01:46:15.189 --> 01:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
it's certainly when we provide a
 
01:46:18.589 --> 01:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
checklist it's a snapshot in time and
 
01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
the checklist that we would provide
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
today either at the state level or at
 
01:46:23.709 --> 01:46:23.719 align:start position:0%
the local level

01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know I think I I've made
 
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
all of the the points that uh that need
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
to be made on this it's just uh you know
 
01:46:39.310 --> 01:46:39.320 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about the public
 
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
checklist that is the you know that is
 
01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
the domain of the legislature and
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
establishing the policy you know what
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
fees we should charge you know what's
 
01:46:51.149 --> 01:46:51.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate um who can obtain it um but
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of the private and confidential
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
data uh that we hold on each individual
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
voter that is separate and distinct and
 
01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
we have made a very strong commitment in
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
the past that we would maintain that
 
01:47:05.470 --> 01:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and uh we will certainly
 
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
continue to fight to do that so with
 
01:47:09.629 --> 01:47:09.639 align:start position:0%

here representative Kofa thank you for
 
01:51:49.709 --> 01:51:49.719 align:start position:0%
the question as far as I know the
 
01:51:53.109 --> 01:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
committee is always open for amendments
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%

01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
poal
 
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
um is in regards to the house and this
 
01:52:06.189 --> 01:52:06.199 align:start position:0%
is a general opening statement for other
 
01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to chime in um
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's a little out of order but from
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
normal business but representative
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
kofalt has asked a question about an
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
amendment representative kofalt I think
 
01:52:19.109 --> 01:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
joins the house for the first time so
 
01:52:21.310 --> 01:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
welcome to the house and welcome to the
 
01:52:23.189 --> 01:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
election law committee
 
01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
um we are in the first of two a two-year
 
01:52:28.350 --> 01:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
session and we all heard representative
 
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
foran suggest um that give while there
 
01:52:34.069 --> 01:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
might be some Merit to this bill given
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
the session the challenges and I would
 
01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
point out the year of the session where
 
01:52:41.550 --> 01:52:41.560 align:start position:0%
the budget is really the priority um
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
this may or may not be something that
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
the committee wants to work on to do an
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
amendment or may not be something the
 
01:52:50.310 --> 01:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
committee has the ability to work on an
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
amendment representative kofalt learning
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
as we all know that we ask OSS for
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
amendments to statute or to do certain
 
01:53:01.149 --> 01:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
things and inevitably during public
 
01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
hearings we find out especially in
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
election law that there are other
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
statutes that are impacted that need to
 
01:53:11.310 --> 01:53:11.320 align:start position:0%
be looked at um so one example of how
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
the committee might deal with things
 
01:53:16.030 --> 01:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
that they think are of Merit that maybe
 
01:53:18.790 --> 01:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
are not going to otherwise be able to be
 
01:53:20.910 --> 01:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
dealt with this session is that bills
 
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
can be retained
 
01:53:25.709 --> 01:53:25.719 align:start position:0%
um with the report as to what should
 
01:53:28.589 --> 01:53:28.599 align:start position:0%
happen with them so that further work
 
01:53:33.550 --> 01:53:33.560 align:start position:0%
can be done on them whereas uh itls will
 
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
end the subject matter for this for this
 
01:53:40.669 --> 01:53:40.679 align:start position:0%
session so um I just put that out there
 
01:53:42.629 --> 01:53:42.639 align:start position:0%
as a general statement on all the bills
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
the committee is working
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
on because I think this is an example of
 
01:53:50.069 --> 01:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
a bill that had other statutes that were
 
01:53:51.709 --> 01:53:51.719 align:start position:0%
impacted but not addressed in the
 
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
drafting by OLS and it has things that
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
are going to require I suspect a few
 
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
good Minds to work on an amendments so
 
01:54:03.189 --> 01:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
representative profal I thank you for
 
01:54:05.069 --> 01:54:05.079 align:start position:0%
bringing the bill
 
01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:07.679 align:start position:0%
forward and I think the committee is
 
01:54:09.709 --> 01:54:09.719 align:start position:0%
going to have to have a discussion on
 
01:54:11.669 --> 01:54:11.679 align:start position:0%
how to proceed on this bill and other
 
01:54:13.870 --> 01:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
bills but if you have an amendment that
 
01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:15.920 align:start position:0%

01:54:18.990 --> 01:54:19.000 align:start position:0%

electronically that you have spoken on
 
01:56:52.270 --> 01:56:52.280 align:start position:0%

01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
am looking around the committee room
 
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
here and I'm not seeing a lot of
 
01:56:59.910 --> 01:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
enlightened faces as to the amendment so
 
01:57:01.709 --> 01:57:01.719 align:start position:0%
I am gonna assume that's going to be
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
true for most of the members
 
01:57:05.189 --> 01:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
participating electronically so why
 
01:57:07.109 --> 01:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
don't you tell us about the bill in the
 
01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:09.920 align:start position:0%

01:57:25.069 --> 01:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
bills to to look over so I appreciate it
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
and I'll try and keep it as brief as I
 
01:57:29.310 --> 01:57:29.320 align:start position:0%
possibly can today I'm here to ask you
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
to support House Bill 370 this bill does
 
01:57:35.149 --> 01:57:35.159 align:start position:0%
not split up our Electoral College votes
 
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
by District or state similar to the main
 
01:57:41.270 --> 01:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
and ab Braska approach similar to recent
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 43 that would have done
 
01:57:46.629 --> 01:57:46.639 align:start position:0%
exactly that and was unan unanimously
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
killed by the
 
01:57:51.709 --> 01:57:51.719 align:start position:0%
senate for years presidents have been
 
01:57:54.430 --> 01:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
elected by the Electoral College the
 
01:57:56.430 --> 01:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
Electoral College ensures all areas of
 
01:57:58.350 --> 01:57:58.360 align:start position:0%
the country have a voice and who is
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
chosen to lead our great country and has
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
a built-in way to limit what areas of
 
01:58:04.430 --> 01:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
the country have their concerns heard on
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
the campaign
 
01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
trail that protection is that no one
 
01:58:09.910 --> 01:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
knows before the election where the
 
01:58:12.189 --> 01:58:12.199 align:start position:0%
Battleground areas are and putting too
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
much effort in one area might lead to a
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
win in one area but losses everywhere
 
01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
else HB 370 brings that same system into
 
01:58:25.990 --> 01:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
existence at the state level we as New
 
01:58:28.750 --> 01:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire love our uniqueness we hold
 
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
our first in the nation primary even if
 
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
Nevada wants to challenge that we are
 
01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
one of the few states that doesn't have
 
01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
a lieutenant governor but what we have
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
even more uniquely as an executive
 
01:58:42.830 --> 01:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
Council which is why it shouldn't be
 
01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
surprising that we would come up with
 
01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
our never tried before method method to
 
01:58:48.750 --> 01:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
try to bring the benefits of the
 
01:58:52.350 --> 01:58:52.360 align:start position:0%
Electoral College to our state level
 
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
which makes such an attractive state to
 
01:58:58.550 --> 01:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
come to during presidential elections HB
 
01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
370 would continue to boost our profile
 
01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:03.679 align:start position:0%
at the national level it makes us even
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
more unique than we already are an
 
01:59:08.589 --> 01:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
argument will be made that this is
 
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
political but the data doesn't support
 
01:59:13.069 --> 01:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
that the Electoral College is so
 
01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
important that everyone has a voice in
 
01:59:18.030 --> 01:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
who they elect a candidate who wishes to
 
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
become president must obtain a plurality
 
01:59:22.830 --> 01:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
of votes in a majority of the five
 
01:59:25.270 --> 01:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
districts this means that a presidential
 
01:59:27.950 --> 01:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
candidate has to go to Berlin excuse me
 
01:59:31.069 --> 01:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
barlin colbrook sandwich and most
 
01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
importantly dickville Notch which holds
 
01:59:36.790 --> 01:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
the first in the first election instead
 
01:59:40.270 --> 01:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
of just having to go to Manchester NASA
 
01:59:43.870 --> 01:59:43.880 align:start position:0%
Portsmith and conquered this bill makes
 
01:59:45.870 --> 01:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
presidential candidates fight harder for
 
01:59:48.870 --> 01:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
our votes I ask you to please support
 
01:59:51.790 --> 01:59:51.800 align:start position:0%
this bill as written not and not the
 
01:59:53.910 --> 01:59:53.920 align:start position:0%

02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh the method to splitting up the
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
electoral votes by uh popular vote and I
 
02:02:11.229 --> 02:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
think that that is just a step on the
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
way to um splitting up our electoral
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
votes by uh uh National popular vote and
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
I think that uh that that type of Bill
 
02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
kind of changes the whole or the an
 
02:02:28.030 --> 02:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
amendment changes the whole uh purpose
 
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
of this bill and should be uh presented
 
02:02:32.709 --> 02:02:32.719 align:start position:0%
on its own in
 
02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
November and not uh as as an amendment
 
02:02:40.109 --> 02:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
to this bill and so I think that it I I
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
value the the Electoral College and I
 
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
think that some of the protections that
 
02:02:49.870 --> 02:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
um that the Electoral College gives the
 
02:02:52.709 --> 02:02:52.719 align:start position:0%
whole country would be valuable for for
 
02:02:55.310 --> 02:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to adopt especially in
 
02:03:00.589 --> 02:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
light of um concerns ongoing uh about
 
02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
the security of our elections and so I
 
02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
think this is one way that we will be
 
02:03:09.870 --> 02:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
able to uh bootstrap our elections to
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's harder to game uh
 
02:03:15.709 --> 02:03:15.719 align:start position:0%
our our elections in New Hampshire so I
 
02:03:18.270 --> 02:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm happy to take any
 
02:03:20.149 --> 02:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for
 
02:03:22.870 --> 02:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
joining us this morning are there any
 
02:03:27.870 --> 02:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
questions from members in the
 
02:03:31.229 --> 02:03:31.239 align:start position:0%
room representative Lane do you have a
 
02:03:34.750 --> 02:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
question yes um I would interested to
 
02:03:38.950 --> 02:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
know why doing this by executive council
 
02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
is more representative of the state than
 
02:03:44.510 --> 02:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
it's currently being
 
02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
done thank you for the thank you for the
 
02:03:48.589 --> 02:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
question so
 
02:03:48.599 --> 02:03:50.350 align:start position:0%
question so
currently

02:03:50.350 --> 02:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:03:53.669 --> 02:03:53.679 align:start position:0%
um there the place there are places in
 
02:03:57.310 --> 02:03:57.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that have like uh like the
 
02:04:00.189 --> 02:04:00.199 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast or like the Northern parts of
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
the state which ha may have different
 
02:04:07.270 --> 02:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
priorities than other parts of the
 
02:04:12.669 --> 02:04:12.679 align:start position:0%
states whether it be um fishing or
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
um Crossing um people trade between uh
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
Canada etc etc whereas other parts of
 
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
the states like nsha may be concerned
 
02:04:25.589 --> 02:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
more about the relationship to
 
02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
um Boston and and the tech industry etc
 
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
etc and so when
 
02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:34.069 align:start position:0%
etc and so when
you

02:04:34.069 --> 02:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
uh allow each section of the state
 
02:04:41.390 --> 02:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
to um kind of have a voice in that
 
02:04:45.069 --> 02:04:45.079 align:start position:0%
opinion uh instead of being overwhelmed
 
02:04:47.229 --> 02:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
like the you know the places in the
 
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
north their their uh voices may not be
 
02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
heard as much
 
02:04:56.030 --> 02:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
because of the voices in new Hamp in
 
02:04:58.430 --> 02:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
nashille let's say for example are much
 
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
louder voices because there's more
 
02:05:02.549 --> 02:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
people in that place that doesn't
 
02:05:04.270 --> 02:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that those people in
 
02:05:07.229 --> 02:05:07.239 align:start position:0%
the North or in the Sea Coast etc etc
 
02:05:09.470 --> 02:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
their concerns aren't valid and should
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
not be considered as a as um a person
 
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
who we are choosing to represent new uh
 
02:05:17.069 --> 02:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as a whole so thank you
 
02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative other
 
02:05:26.549 --> 02:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:29.109 --> 02:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
members representative Mir I'm sorry I
 
02:05:31.669 --> 02:05:31.679 align:start position:0%
missed you go ahead please thank you
 
02:05:34.030 --> 02:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair um and thank you
 
02:05:36.030 --> 02:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
representative um I'm curious about
 
02:05:39.790 --> 02:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
whether your proposal um might make it
 
02:05:42.310 --> 02:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
possible for um a presidential candidate
 
02:05:44.990 --> 02:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
to win New Hampshire's electoral votes
 
02:05:47.910 --> 02:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
without winning um the most votes in the
 
02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:58.069 --> 02:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question yes it
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
would be possible but they would have to
 
02:06:04.910 --> 02:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
win in a wide area so electoral Co vote
 
02:06:08.069 --> 02:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
electoral districts as you know are are
 
02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
meant to be divided up by uh equally
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the state by population but
 
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily mean
 
02:06:22.030 --> 02:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
that um people's choices for who they
 
02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
would choose would be equally
 
02:06:27.950 --> 02:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
distributed throughout the the state so
 
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
if two3 of the state
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
chose um if a majority in two thirds of
 
02:06:39.669 --> 02:06:39.679 align:start position:0%
the state would choose one but uh a
 
02:06:44.069 --> 02:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
higher percentage in the
 
02:06:49.229 --> 02:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
uh if yeah if three fifths of the state
 
02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
chose one but a higher majority in the
 
02:06:55.549 --> 02:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
leftover two states or the the Le
 
02:06:59.790 --> 02:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
leftover two districts were uh choose
 
02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
the opposite it's potentially possible
 
02:07:08.629 --> 02:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
that those two districts would not uh
 
02:07:11.109 --> 02:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
would be enough to overwhelm the major
 
02:07:14.830 --> 02:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
the margin of air uh the margin of
 
02:07:17.669 --> 02:07:17.679 align:start position:0%
distri the margin of difference in the
 
02:07:17.679 --> 02:07:19.069 align:start position:0%
distri the margin of difference in the
other

02:07:19.069 --> 02:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:07:24.750 --> 02:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
three uh electoral college or the
 
02:07:27.229 --> 02:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
Electoral uh executive council districts
 
02:07:27.239 --> 02:07:27.950 align:start position:0%
Electoral uh executive council districts
I'm

02:07:27.950 --> 02:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
02:07:32.350 --> 02:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
sorry so yes it is theoretically
 
02:07:34.750 --> 02:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
possible thank you further questions
 
02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:37.430 align:start position:0%
possible thank you further questions
from

02:07:37.430 --> 02:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:39.950 --> 02:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
panelists that committee members
 
02:07:42.750 --> 02:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
representative Wayne yes this is a bit
 
02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
of a followup to my former question if I
 
02:07:46.910 --> 02:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly then you are
 
02:07:50.430 --> 02:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
saying that when you look at um say a
 
02:07:52.830 --> 02:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
executive Council District too that the
 
02:07:55.149 --> 02:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
people in Kean and the people on the Sea
 
02:07:58.229 --> 02:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
Coast have the same interests because
 
02:08:00.510 --> 02:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
you've is that correct do I understand
 
02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
that I'm so it it will depend how the um
 
02:08:12.790 --> 02:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
electoral districts or the executive
 
02:08:15.149 --> 02:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
council districts are drawn under this
 
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
new in the new map whether or not those
 
02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
two would be in the same electoral uh or
 
02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:24.549 align:start position:0%
two would be in the same electoral uh or
the

02:08:24.549 --> 02:08:24.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:28.549 --> 02:08:28.559 align:start position:0%
same uh executive Council district and
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
so um my f or you could make an argument
 
02:08:35.310 --> 02:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
that you could go even smaller and say
 
02:08:38.030 --> 02:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
you know it at the Town level uh should
 
02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:39.310 align:start position:0%
you know it at the Town level uh should
be

02:08:39.310 --> 02:08:39.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:08:43.629 --> 02:08:43.639 align:start position:0%
decided uh and but I think that that
 
02:08:43.639 --> 02:08:44.910 align:start position:0%
decided uh and but I think that that
would

02:08:44.910 --> 02:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
um that's fine that an argument to make
 
02:08:51.109 --> 02:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that um it has to be
 
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
elect elal College districts or not
 
02:08:55.629 --> 02:08:55.639 align:start position:0%
Electoral College the executive Council
 
02:08:58.069 --> 02:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
District sorry I'm not saying that it
 
02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
has to be that I'm just saying that the
 
02:09:03.149 --> 02:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
uh the benefits of bringing the
 
02:09:04.910 --> 02:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
electoral college system to New
 
02:09:11.470 --> 02:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be uh one that it would
 
02:09:12.990 --> 02:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
offer the opportunity for different
 
02:09:16.990 --> 02:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
parts of the states to have their voices
 
02:09:20.709 --> 02:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
heard and it would also offer um
 
02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
protections as far as uh security of the
 
02:09:28.030 --> 02:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
elections in so far that it's harder to
 
02:09:32.109 --> 02:09:32.119 align:start position:0%
game a system like that where as you
 
02:09:35.549 --> 02:09:35.559 align:start position:0%
know people talking about oh you know
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
people voting that from from
 
02:09:44.709 --> 02:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh a temporary housing or um a vacation
 
02:09:46.470 --> 02:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
rental or something like that whether or
 
02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
not they were allowed to vote you know
 
02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
some people from uh vacation towns are
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
being uh I I think
 
02:10:02.350 --> 02:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
unfairly um aligned by other other towns
 
02:10:04.069 --> 02:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
by saying you know whether or not these
 
02:10:05.790 --> 02:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
people are allowed to vote in their town
 
02:10:09.709 --> 02:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
and so if they weren't allow if
 
02:10:09.719 --> 02:10:11.270 align:start position:0%
and so if they weren't allow if
it

02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:10:13.790 --> 02:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
was um in a different section and it
 
02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:15.990 align:start position:0%
was um in a different section and it
didn't

02:10:15.990 --> 02:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
02:10:18.390 --> 02:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
in representative we're going to move on
 
02:10:22.109 --> 02:10:22.119 align:start position:0%
to any other thank you
 
02:10:22.119 --> 02:10:24.549 align:start position:0%
to any other thank you

thank you madam chair and good morning
 
02:11:27.149 --> 02:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
to you and members of the election law
 
02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
02:11:32.549 --> 02:11:32.559 align:start position:0%
Linda Bundy and I'm a voter from antrum
 
02:11:35.669 --> 02:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
I am speaking in opposition to HB
 
02:11:39.430 --> 02:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
370 currently all presidential electors
 
02:11:41.149 --> 02:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
are awarded to the presidential
 
02:11:43.990 --> 02:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
candidate who wins a plurality of the
 
02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
popular vote in our state if HB 370 is
 
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
enacted and electors of the president
 
02:11:53.189 --> 02:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
and Vice President of the United States
 
02:11:56.069 --> 02:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
are designated by the party that
 
02:11:58.830 --> 02:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
receives a plurality of votes in a
 
02:12:02.350 --> 02:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
plurality of executive council districts
 
02:12:05.069 --> 02:12:05.079 align:start position:0%
it is conceivable that the presidential
 
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
electors could be awarded to a candidate
 
02:12:10.350 --> 02:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
who did not win a plurality of the
 
02:12:13.229 --> 02:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
popular vote while still winning a
 
02:12:15.950 --> 02:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
plurality of the executive council
 
02:12:18.790 --> 02:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
districts all votes would not carry the
 
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
same weight as demonstrated in
 
02:12:25.629 --> 02:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
2011 voting districts can be unfairly
 
02:12:27.870 --> 02:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
manipulated during the redistricting
 
02:12:31.350 --> 02:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
process to take advantage of the system
 
02:12:33.669 --> 02:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
a Jerry Mander like executive Council
 
02:12:37.310 --> 02:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
District 2 could unfairly deprive voters
 
02:12:39.709 --> 02:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
of the power of their vote that's
 
02:12:41.629 --> 02:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
neither the New Hampshire nor the
 
02:12:45.310 --> 02:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
American way additionally if there were
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
an absence of a plurality in the
 
02:12:50.350 --> 02:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
executive council districts and the New
 
02:12:53.189 --> 02:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Senate awarded the electors
 
02:12:55.549 --> 02:12:55.559 align:start position:0%
the result could be even further removed
 
02:12:58.229 --> 02:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
from the wishes of the voters for these
 
02:13:02.549 --> 02:13:02.559 align:start position:0%
reasons I oppose HB 370 I believe that
 
02:13:05.470 --> 02:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
one person one vote is what matters in
 
02:13:08.229 --> 02:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
determining which candidates are awarded
 
02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:11.360 align:start position:0%

represent uh oh here we go I represent
 
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
stford County district 6 this is the
 
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
towns of Durham and Madbury so that's in
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast I have lived in grafting
 
02:14:25.109 --> 02:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
County in the past which is the North
 
02:14:27.229 --> 02:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
country and believe me the presidential
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
candid campaigns paid plenty of
 
02:14:31.629 --> 02:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
attention to us up there I have lived at
 
02:14:33.470 --> 02:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
various times in past in large states
 
02:14:36.589 --> 02:14:36.599 align:start position:0%
and uh well they they're as American as
 
02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
anyone else I've lived in New York and
 
02:14:40.750 --> 02:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
California but um anyway the timing of
 
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is I think could not be worse
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
I mean it was probably filed uh you know
 
02:14:47.629 --> 02:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
back in November long before the events
 
02:14:51.430 --> 02:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
of January 6 20221 when a mob invaded
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
the capital during the official count of
 
02:14:56.149 --> 02:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
the 2020 electoral vote so that and of
 
02:14:57.390 --> 02:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
course that Invasion turned what should
 
02:15:00.830 --> 02:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
have been a routine ceremony honoring
 
02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
the let's speak to the bill all right
 
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so um we in New Hampshire we
 
02:15:09.470 --> 02:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
were fortunate we had an unambiguous
 
02:15:10.549 --> 02:15:10.559 align:start position:0%
presidential election here in the
 
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
granted State uh Biden and Harris won a
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
free Fair well-run election by
 
02:15:18.430 --> 02:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable margin 48% of hire's Voters
 
02:15:20.270 --> 02:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
were disappointed by the result but 100%
 
02:15:22.069 --> 02:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
of those voters confident that the vote
 
02:15:25.470 --> 02:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
count was correct um and the uh
 
02:15:27.629 --> 02:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
electoral college is a ancient but
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
controversial institution because
 
02:15:31.750 --> 02:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
amongst other problems it's possible for
 
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
one presidential candidate to win the
 
02:15:34.709 --> 02:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
popular vote without winning the
 
02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
presidency um this happened most
 
02:15:40.990 --> 02:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
recently in 2016 and uh as some Britten
 
02:15:42.669 --> 02:15:42.679 align:start position:0%
testimony I go on about what happened
 
02:15:44.270 --> 02:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
over the last four years let's just say
 
02:15:48.310 --> 02:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
it was not all good um and uh the
 
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
previous president um he was not
 
02:15:52.229 --> 02:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
reelected in November so not being
 
02:15:54.669 --> 02:15:54.679 align:start position:0%
reelected is pretty a normal occurrence
 
02:15:56.069 --> 02:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
which happened to many other presidents
 
02:15:57.709 --> 02:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
who serve during bad times including
 
02:15:57.719 --> 02:15:58.629 align:start position:0%
who serve during bad times including
some

02:15:58.629 --> 02:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:16:05.549 --> 02:16:05.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
me anyway okay um it's bad enough that a
 
02:16:11.510 --> 02:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
president can win the electoral college
 
02:16:13.310 --> 02:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
without winning popular vote Nationwide
 
02:16:14.709 --> 02:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
and actually this
 
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
year this year what happened Nationwide
 
02:16:18.990 --> 02:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
it should have been a you know it was a
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
pretty much of a clear-cut uh the result
 
02:16:23.910 --> 02:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
was pretty clear clut Nationwide I mean
 
02:16:26.310 --> 02:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
their election was not entirely without
 
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
problems but like you know it's pretty
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
obvious who wanted who lost and uh
 
02:16:33.469 --> 02:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
decide that one got a comfortable
 
02:16:35.190 --> 02:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
majority of the Electoral College and
 
02:16:37.230 --> 02:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
the actually got and the popular vote
 
02:16:40.950 --> 02:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
but anyway but it's bad this could but
 
02:16:42.990 --> 02:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
it's even worse this could happen here
 
02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
Statewide our electoral votes could go
 
02:16:48.429 --> 02:16:48.439 align:start position:0%
to um a candidate who didn't win the
 
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide uh
 
02:16:52.750 --> 02:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
popular vote because it's certainly in
 
02:16:54.429 --> 02:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
fact this probably might have happened
 
02:16:58.950 --> 02:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
in 2020 because we had uh we had w we
 
02:17:00.669 --> 02:17:00.679 align:start position:0%
one Electoral College District that was
 
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know heavily skewed heavily skewed
 
02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
Democratic and um so and but there's
 
02:17:08.070 --> 02:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
four El Republican electoral counselors
 
02:17:10.910 --> 02:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
and one Democrat which uh that's how it
 
02:17:14.230 --> 02:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
goes so um you know it allows president
 
02:17:15.790 --> 02:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
take to get our states for electoral
 
02:17:16.990 --> 02:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
votes without a majority of the
 
02:17:18.910 --> 02:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide Vote or even a plurality
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
depending on how the votes are
 
02:17:22.589 --> 02:17:22.599 align:start position:0%
distributed between the five uh rather
 
02:17:25.030 --> 02:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily drawn executive council
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
districts and for good measure if no
 
02:17:28.870 --> 02:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
take a wins the plurality of the five
 
02:17:31.030 --> 02:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
districts I mean which that's virtually
 
02:17:33.790 --> 02:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
impossible U especially if we if the
 
02:17:36.790 --> 02:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
two- party system stays in place but um
 
02:17:38.389 --> 02:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
the Tai vote is broken not by the
 
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide vote totals um but by the
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
state senate and that's like uh makes me
 
02:17:45.589 --> 02:17:45.599 align:start position:0%
a little aggravated to see that even
 
02:17:47.870 --> 02:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
though it could almost never happen we
 
02:17:51.309 --> 02:17:51.319 align:start position:0%
did have several state legislators uh in
 
02:17:54.270 --> 02:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
other states per pressure to like uh IGN
 
02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:55.349 align:start position:0%
other states per pressure to like uh IGN
you

02:17:55.349 --> 02:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:17:58.469 --> 02:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
know I'm rning behind schedule so I'm
 
02:18:01.110 --> 02:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to stick okay I'm
 
02:18:04.509 --> 02:18:04.519 align:start position:0%
almost I'm almost done here uh so I so I
 
02:18:06.870 --> 02:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
I that's an objectionable provision that
 
02:18:08.709 --> 02:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
the state senate would choose the
 
02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
electors even if it's in a situation
 
02:18:15.629 --> 02:18:15.639 align:start position:0%
that is virtually impossible U the New
 
02:18:17.629 --> 02:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Senate is by the way it's of
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
course the other problem is which state
 
02:18:21.349 --> 02:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
senate is going to elect the ctors if
 
02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
there is you know a
 
02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
deadlock amongst the executive councils
 
02:18:28.389 --> 02:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
like is it the is it the previous Senate
 
02:18:30.150 --> 02:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
that's voted out of office in November
 
02:18:31.790 --> 02:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
or is it the incoming Senate and they
 
02:18:33.469 --> 02:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
only take office a few days before the
 
02:18:35.070 --> 02:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
electors are supposed to meet to cast
 
02:18:37.910 --> 02:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
their votes so that's that's uh
 
02:18:39.870 --> 02:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
problematic right there like um so
 
02:18:42.509 --> 02:18:42.519 align:start position:0%
that's U basically is everybody
 
02:18:44.190 --> 02:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
including one of the co-sponsors agree
 
02:18:46.750 --> 02:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
this is a bad Bill and it should be
 
02:18:49.709 --> 02:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
killed but just on a you know Ty the
 
02:18:51.830 --> 02:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
facts unworkable it's it's a
 
02:18:54.349 --> 02:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
fundamentally bad and unfair idea so I
 
02:18:56.589 --> 02:18:56.599 align:start position:0%
find it um somewhat repugnant to our
 
02:18:58.589 --> 02:18:58.599 align:start position:0%
small D democratic ideals here in the
 
02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that's uh that's that's a
 
02:19:06.589 --> 02:19:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:09.990 --> 02:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
so is there any in the room or
 
02:19:12.070 --> 02:19:12.080 align:start position:0%

02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:16.309 align:start position:0%
electronically that has a question for
representative

02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%

02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my testimony I I hadn't
 
02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
intended to speak but I do oppose this
 
02:20:50.160 --> 02:20:51.469 align:start position:0%
intended to speak but I do oppose this
bill

02:20:51.469 --> 02:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
um what made me want to speak though
 
02:20:57.750 --> 02:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
were the comments from representative
 
02:21:02.150 --> 02:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
yoka one of the sponsors who talked
 
02:21:06.389 --> 02:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
about um one of the reasons he put this
 
02:21:09.190 --> 02:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
bill forward was concerns about security
 
02:21:11.950 --> 02:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
and making it harder to gain the system
 
02:21:15.349 --> 02:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
and I find it very upsetting when these
 
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
sorts of comments get put forth with
 
02:21:23.750 --> 02:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
no no facts backing them up no
 
02:21:28.349 --> 02:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
Foundation um they're very serious uh
 
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
accusations against our election system
 
02:21:36.270 --> 02:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
we were shown to have a a very um good
 
02:21:38.950 --> 02:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
election here in New Hampshire uh we can
 
02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
be proud of our election integrity and I
 
02:21:43.950 --> 02:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
just could not let such claims go
 
02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:47.520 align:start position:0%

final plan it further requires map
 
02:24:11.110 --> 02:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
drafts to be posted on some public

prior to holding a
 
02:24:42.030 --> 02:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
hearing the public has become far more
 
02:24:44.590 --> 02:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
aware of the importance of redistricting
 
02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
in the past 10 years as a legislature
 
02:24:49.950 --> 02:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
gets ready to do its work to draw a new
 
02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:50.870 align:start position:0%
gets ready to do its work to draw a new
map

02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
map
 
02:24:53.469 --> 02:24:53.479 align:start position:0%
voters of both parties and Undeclared
 
02:24:56.590 --> 02:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
voters are demanding transparency and
 
02:24:59.469 --> 02:24:59.479 align:start position:0%
fairness this bill still leaves the
 
02:25:02.349 --> 02:25:02.359 align:start position:0%
process in the hands of the legislature
 
02:25:04.990 --> 02:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
and that's an important thing to note by
 
02:25:07.590 --> 02:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
making this process transparent and
 
02:25:10.510 --> 02:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
welcoming of public input the voters of
 
02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
all parties will have greater confidence
 
02:25:16.230 --> 02:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
in the fairness of the final plan I hope
 
02:25:18.910 --> 02:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
that we can continue to have bipartisan
 
02:25:24.230 --> 02:25:24.240 align:start position:0%

02:25:39.550 --> 02:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
us so questions from committee members
 
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
for representative wal from committee
 
02:25:44.590 --> 02:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
members in
 
02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:48.349 align:start position:0%
members in
fending

02:25:48.349 --> 02:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
electronically I'm not seeing any
 
02:25:52.230 --> 02:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
sentive W I actually have a couple
 
02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:55.269 align:start position:0%
sentive W I actually have a couple
questions

02:25:55.269 --> 02:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
um I would presume that in regards to
 
02:26:01.550 --> 02:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
public hearings the presumption is that
 
02:26:05.309 --> 02:26:05.319 align:start position:0%
you is there your intent would be for as
 
02:26:08.070 --> 02:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
many members of as possible for any such
 
02:26:09.750 --> 02:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
committee to be present at public
 
02:26:12.429 --> 02:26:12.439 align:start position:0%
hearings does that make
 
02:26:17.070 --> 02:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
sense that does but uh as I have learned
 
02:26:19.550 --> 02:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
and come out of the dinosaur age in the
 
02:26:21.150 --> 02:26:21.160 align:start position:0%
last three or four months I've learned
 
02:26:25.269 --> 02:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
of the ability to use electronic um
 
02:26:27.070 --> 02:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
communication such as the zoom
 
02:26:29.429 --> 02:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
conference that we're on right now so I
 
02:26:31.030 --> 02:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
don't think they physically have to be
 
02:26:35.030 --> 02:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
present all right and I have um a
 
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
question in regards to the effective
 
02:26:41.269 --> 02:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
date um the ACT would take effect 60
 
02:26:43.150 --> 02:26:43.160 align:start position:0%
days after its
 
02:26:46.590 --> 02:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
passage um and you know what the time
 
02:26:48.269 --> 02:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
frame is for bills working their way
 
02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
through this session is is it your
 
02:26:53.110 --> 02:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
intent that this would apply to a
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
redistricting commission that might be
 
02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:00.330 align:start position:0%
established before it is pass this
 
02:27:00.330 --> 02:27:02.590 align:start position:0%
established before it is pass this
[Music]

02:27:02.590 --> 02:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:27:05.230 --> 02:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
legislation yes I would think that I
 
02:27:07.429 --> 02:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
would like this new redistricting
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:13.469 --> 02:27:13.479 align:start position:0%

02:27:56.429 --> 02:27:56.439 align:start position:0%

and members of the committee my name is
 
02:28:42.550 --> 02:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
Henry Clement toich and I'm testifying
 
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
today on behalf of the American civil
 
02:28:47.830 --> 02:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
liberties Union um in the interest of
 
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
full disclosure and transparency I am a
 
02:28:53.790 --> 02:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
registered lobbyist for uh that
 
02:28:58.349 --> 02:28:58.359 align:start position:0%
organization so um we support HB
 
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
428 um for the following reasons I think
 
02:29:06.710 --> 02:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
it um would be our preference uh as a
 
02:29:09.070 --> 02:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
civil rights organization that districts
 
02:29:11.710 --> 02:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire following the desial
 
02:29:14.389 --> 02:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
census be um apportioned by an
 
02:29:16.830 --> 02:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
independent redistricting commission but
 
02:29:19.710 --> 02:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
failing that uh this bill is a good bill
 
02:29:22.830 --> 02:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
in the promotes public transparency and
 
02:29:26.510 --> 02:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
confidence by um establishing processes
 
02:29:29.269 --> 02:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
so that the public can be confident that
 
02:29:31.190 --> 02:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
the maps that are drawn are being drawn
 
02:29:34.269 --> 02:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
out in public New Hampshire is one of
 
02:29:38.110 --> 02:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
the few states in the country that has
 
02:29:40.230 --> 02:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
constitutionalized a right of public
 
02:29:42.510 --> 02:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
access to government records in part one
 
02:29:45.150 --> 02:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
article eight of our Constitution and
 
02:29:47.469 --> 02:29:47.479 align:start position:0%
has one of the stronger public records
 
02:29:51.389 --> 02:29:51.399 align:start position:0%
laws uh in any of the states in RSA
 
02:29:55.630 --> 02:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
91a and those laws combined with the
 
02:29:57.750 --> 02:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
legislator's practice of holding a
 
02:30:00.309 --> 02:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
public hearing on every single Bill
 
02:30:02.670 --> 02:30:02.680 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to the citizens of New
 
02:30:05.070 --> 02:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh that we take governmental
 
02:30:08.950 --> 02:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
transparency seriously here and uh this
 
02:30:11.550 --> 02:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
bill would do the same thing for the
 
02:30:13.550 --> 02:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
apportionment process by recognizing
 
02:30:15.550 --> 02:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
that it's a very significant piece of
 
02:30:18.070 --> 02:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
legislation that's going to affect the
 
02:30:20.070 --> 02:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
entire State and many many community
 
02:30:24.190 --> 02:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
ities and would um for example require
 
02:30:26.670 --> 02:30:26.680 align:start position:0%
public hearings be held in every County
 
02:30:29.230 --> 02:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
and would require uh any committee
 
02:30:32.190 --> 02:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
tasked with drawing the apportionment
 
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
plans to maintain a website and post uh
 
02:30:38.389 --> 02:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
the information that they have there and
 
02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
that way at at beginning middle and end
 
02:30:44.630 --> 02:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
of the apportionment process voters in
 
02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and your constituents can
 
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
look at the process and have confidence
 
02:30:52.269 --> 02:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
in why the maps were drawn the way that
 
02:30:55.110 --> 02:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
they were and can come to informed
 
02:30:56.990 --> 02:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
conclusions about whether they like that
 
02:31:01.309 --> 02:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
legislation or not um so we believe that
 
02:31:03.389 --> 02:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
it would be that this bill would be a
 
02:31:06.190 --> 02:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
very important step towards uh fostering
 
02:31:08.389 --> 02:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
public confidence in the apportionment
 
02:31:11.030 --> 02:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
process um and so we urge the committee
 
02:31:13.590 --> 02:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
to vote a to pass and I'm happy to take
 
02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:14.550 align:start position:0%
to vote a to pass and I'm happy to take
any

02:31:14.550 --> 02:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:31:17.550 --> 02:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for joining us today
 
02:31:20.990 --> 02:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
any questions from committee members in
 
02:31:29.469 --> 02:31:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:31.790 --> 02:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
electronically I do have a question
 
02:31:34.389 --> 02:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
actually um one of the requirements of
 
02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
the bill is to have a hearing in every
 
02:31:41.110 --> 02:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
Cil yeah it was pointed out by the prime
 
02:31:43.469 --> 02:31:43.479 align:start position:0%
sponsor in the language of the bill that
 
02:31:45.910 --> 02:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
remote participation is to be
 
02:31:49.190 --> 02:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
allowed so if indeed remote
 
02:31:51.710 --> 02:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
participation is the latest and greatest
 
02:31:54.150 --> 02:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
and we're allowing it why should this
 
02:31:58.429 --> 02:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
commission have to actually go to Every
 
02:32:01.349 --> 02:32:01.359 align:start position:0%
County so I think uh thank you for the
 
02:32:06.070 --> 02:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
question I think the um the intent of
 
02:32:08.750 --> 02:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
holding a hearing in every county is to
 
02:32:12.750 --> 02:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
is to bring an opportunity for people to
 
02:32:15.349 --> 02:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
testify uh before this apportionment
 
02:32:17.349 --> 02:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
committee and to meet those those
 
02:32:19.990 --> 02:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
impacted by the bills where they are and
 
02:32:22.790 --> 02:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
that you know is why in the past for
 
02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
example committees uh addressing the
 
02:32:27.429 --> 02:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
budget have held hearings outside of
 
02:32:30.309 --> 02:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
conquer um in light of the covid-19
 
02:32:32.950 --> 02:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic we wouldn't oppose an amendment
 
02:32:34.630 --> 02:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
that would allow some of those hearings
 
02:32:35.870 --> 02:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
02:32:38.950 --> 02:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
remotely um but I think the I think the
 
02:32:42.750 --> 02:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
intent or the purpose behind it would be
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
um to really the goal would be to
 
02:32:46.950 --> 02:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
promote as much access by the public to
 
02:32:48.429 --> 02:32:48.439 align:start position:0%
these meetings as possible and if that
 
02:32:50.550 --> 02:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
means in the current climate
 
02:32:52.510 --> 02:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
doing it by Zoom I think that's okay but
 
02:32:54.710 --> 02:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
if it means going forward when the
 
02:32:58.190 --> 02:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
pandemic ends fingers crossed um doing
 
02:32:59.870 --> 02:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
it in person in the various counties I
 
02:33:01.389 --> 02:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
think that makes sense
 
02:33:05.990 --> 02:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:08.830 --> 02:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
committee sorry I just I got what I I
 
02:33:10.630 --> 02:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
gota follow so then if the point is to
 
02:33:12.389 --> 02:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
go outad and meet people like County
 
02:33:13.950 --> 02:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
right because Counties have
 
02:33:16.349 --> 02:33:16.359 align:start position:0%
different interest and that's one of the
 
02:33:18.429 --> 02:33:18.439 align:start position:0%
things that we do generally in the
 
02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
districting is sort of try to stick to
 
02:33:23.309 --> 02:33:23.319 align:start position:0%
county lines um does that mean at public
 
02:33:25.870 --> 02:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
hearings we restrict input to people
 
02:33:27.790 --> 02:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
from that county that we having the
 
02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:29.510 align:start position:0%
from that county that we having the
public

02:33:29.510 --> 02:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:33:32.830 --> 02:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
hearing I don't I don't know why um that
 
02:33:33.950 --> 02:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:33:37.510 --> 02:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
necessary candidly um I mean I suppose
 
02:33:39.230 --> 02:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
you could limit testimony that each
 
02:33:41.429 --> 02:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
person can only testify at one public
 
02:33:45.830 --> 02:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
hearing um but uh you know there may be
 
02:33:47.950 --> 02:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
I live in Portsmith it may be that uh
 
02:33:50.190 --> 02:33:50.200 align:start position:0%
the straford county meeting is actually
 
02:33:52.349 --> 02:33:52.359 align:start position:0%
closer to me for whatever reason than
 
02:33:53.670 --> 02:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
the Rockingham County would be so I
 
02:33:55.269 --> 02:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
don't know why you would need to
 
02:33:57.590 --> 02:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
restrict it that way all right thank you
 
02:34:00.309 --> 02:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
I won't take up any more times with my
 
02:34:02.269 --> 02:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
NeverEnding questions about how you
 
02:34:05.830 --> 02:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
should be conducting meetings for
 
02:34:10.750 --> 02:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:13.150 --> 02:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
members all right I'm not seeing any
 
02:34:14.910 --> 02:34:14.920 align:start position:0%

hear from you good morning good
 
02:34:38.030 --> 02:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon good morning let me just see
 
02:34:45.389 --> 02:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:49.870 --> 02:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
camera there we go thank you madam chair
 
02:34:51.590 --> 02:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
my name is Phil Hatcher and I'm a
 
02:34:52.670 --> 02:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
resident of
 
02:34:54.990 --> 02:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
Dober I'm testifying today to urge you
 
02:34:56.910 --> 02:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
to support HB
 
02:35:00.429 --> 02:35:00.439 align:start position:0%
428 on February 20 on February 10th
 
02:35:03.230 --> 02:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
Gober city council passed a resolution
 
02:35:04.990 --> 02:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
calling for the redistricting process to
 
02:35:07.550 --> 02:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
be transparent and open in public to the
 
02:35:09.950 --> 02:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
public input at all stages I believe
 
02:35:11.389 --> 02:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
this is one piece of evidence that there
 
02:35:13.150 --> 02:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
is Broad support for this bipartisan
 
02:35:16.030 --> 02:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
Bill across the state one of our
 
02:35:17.349 --> 02:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
counselors did vote against the
 
02:35:20.070 --> 02:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
resolution however although he orted the
 
02:35:21.750 --> 02:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
sentiment of the resolution he was
 
02:35:23.469 --> 02:35:23.479 align:start position:0%
concerned about the council getting
 
02:35:26.990 --> 02:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
drawn into a partisan political fights
 
02:35:28.950 --> 02:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
but this makes me wonder how can calling
 
02:35:30.910 --> 02:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
for open and transparent redistricting
 
02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
be part of a partisan
 
02:35:34.870 --> 02:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
fight do some people think that the only
 
02:35:36.230 --> 02:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
way they can attain their political
 
02:35:38.190 --> 02:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
goals is through a closed process with
 
02:35:39.309 --> 02:35:39.319 align:start position:0%
no public
 
02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
input why should redistricting be any
 
02:35:42.990 --> 02:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
different than the consideration of
 
02:35:45.429 --> 02:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
bills to create new laws where there are
 
02:35:47.429 --> 02:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
mandatory public hearings such as this
 
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
one public trust in government is is
 
02:35:51.550 --> 02:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
severely eroded because people believe
 
02:35:53.269 --> 02:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
that politicians too often act upon
 
02:35:54.990 --> 02:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
their own self-interests rather than in
 
02:35:57.910 --> 02:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
the public interest Jerry mandering in
 
02:35:59.870 --> 02:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
particular is disliked for this reason
 
02:36:02.230 --> 02:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
by people of all political
 
02:36:04.429 --> 02:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
Persuasions and remember that supporters
 
02:36:06.469 --> 02:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
of both parties are hurt when one party
 
02:36:08.469 --> 02:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
draws District boundaries for political
 
02:36:10.910 --> 02:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
gain consider New Hampshire's notorious
 
02:36:13.110 --> 02:36:13.120 align:start position:0%
second executive Council District in
 
02:36:15.190 --> 02:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
which Democrats were packed to improve
 
02:36:17.030 --> 02:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
Republican chances in the other
 
02:36:19.070 --> 02:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
districts Republican voters in the
 
02:36:20.950 --> 02:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
second district had their voices taken
 
02:36:23.110 --> 02:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
away which in particular could be
 
02:36:24.750 --> 02:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
problematic when executive Council
 
02:36:26.590 --> 02:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
decisions impact their local towns and
 
02:36:29.070 --> 02:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
cities in ways not fully understood by
 
02:36:30.910 --> 02:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
the counselors and other
 
02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
districts please vote ought to pass an
 
02:36:36.990 --> 02:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
hp42 28 please vote for open and
 
02:36:39.309 --> 02:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
transparent redistricting and please
 
02:36:41.309 --> 02:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
take one small step towards rebuilding
 
02:36:44.590 --> 02:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
trust in government thank you very much
 
02:36:46.150 --> 02:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
 
02:36:51.429 --> 02:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:57.230 --> 02:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:00.190 --> 02:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
P I'm not seeing any thank you very much
 
02:37:03.309 --> 02:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
for being with us this morning also
 
02:37:06.349 --> 02:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak on this bill is
 
02:37:10.070 --> 02:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
Cynthia Walter uh Cynthia if you're here
 
02:37:11.870 --> 02:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
could you raise your hand I just don't
 
02:37:16.110 --> 02:37:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:24.190 --> 02:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
Cynthia you should you're with us again
 
02:37:30.150 --> 02:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:34.469 --> 02:37:34.479 align:start position:0%
428 yes I'm here can you hear me now can
 
02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay great so again I'm Cynthia Walter
 
02:37:39.750 --> 02:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
I'm a retired uh science Professor
 
02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
biologist and I'm I teach statistics all
 
02:37:47.590 --> 02:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
the time and so I strongly recommend um
 
02:37:50.190 --> 02:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
passing this bill because it it provides
 
02:37:53.590 --> 02:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
Fair uh um opportunities for citizens to
 
02:37:55.870 --> 02:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
understand the districts I've um worked
 
02:37:58.710 --> 02:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
on campaigns ever for the last uh 40
 
02:38:02.590 --> 02:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
years of my life just as a volunteer and
 
02:38:04.590 --> 02:38:04.600 align:start position:0%
so I understand how important it is for
 
02:38:06.990 --> 02:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
people to know where these boundaries
 
02:38:08.830 --> 02:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
are and how those boundaries got to be
 
02:38:11.870 --> 02:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
where they are so I hardly endorsed the
 
02:38:14.510 --> 02:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
bill I just I'm the one who suggested a
 
02:38:16.110 --> 02:38:16.120 align:start position:0%
slight modification in the bill
 
02:38:19.030 --> 02:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
associated with the um collection of
 
02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:20.710 align:start position:0%
associated with the um collection of
information

02:38:20.710 --> 02:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:38:25.710 --> 02:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
um from the um um Municipal uh electoral
 
02:38:28.469 --> 02:38:28.479 align:start position:0%
officials and their testimony needs to
 
02:38:32.070 --> 02:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
be public and we also need more publicly
 
02:38:35.590 --> 02:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
available information to the public on
 
02:38:39.070 --> 02:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
the results of the census
 
02:38:41.389 --> 02:38:41.399 align:start position:0%
information in other words we can't
 
02:38:44.830 --> 02:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
understand why the maps might be drawn
 
02:38:47.710 --> 02:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
differently coming forward than than
 
02:38:50.550 --> 02:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
they were in the past if we if all the
 
02:38:52.910 --> 02:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
people don't have all the information in
 
02:38:56.750 --> 02:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
a fair open um environment um and so
 
02:38:58.910 --> 02:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's important I think to pass this bill
 
02:39:01.349 --> 02:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
and have those exchanges but we have to
 
02:39:03.510 --> 02:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
give everybody the information to make
 
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
the exchanges
 
02:39:07.710 --> 02:39:07.720 align:start position:0%
worthwhile um for and just a quick
 
02:39:10.590 --> 02:39:10.600 align:start position:0%
example um of why we need to make the
 
02:39:12.389 --> 02:39:12.399 align:start position:0%
Census Data
 
02:39:15.110 --> 02:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
available to both the um electoral
 
02:39:17.710 --> 02:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
officials in a form of a questionnaire
 
02:39:20.110 --> 02:39:20.120 align:start position:0%
that they would then address to to make
 
02:39:22.269 --> 02:39:22.279 align:start position:0%
comments about changes in demographics
 
02:39:24.110 --> 02:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
and changes in communities of interest
 
02:39:26.429 --> 02:39:26.439 align:start position:0%
and so on it's important for them to see
 
02:39:27.870 --> 02:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
it but I would like also for that
 
02:39:30.349 --> 02:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
information on the Census Data to become
 
02:39:33.030 --> 02:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
available to the public as well then
 
02:39:36.110 --> 02:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
people can not just guess at how their
 
02:39:37.750 --> 02:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and communities have
 
02:39:40.190 --> 02:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
changed um but they can actually see it
 
02:39:43.750 --> 02:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
represented in some physically clear and
 
02:39:47.070 --> 02:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
and open to the public um plain language
 
02:39:49.389 --> 02:39:49.399 align:start position:0%
descriptions um I know how to get into
 
02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
to census track data but I'm I've got a
 
02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
doctorate you know that's not fair for
 
02:39:57.150 --> 02:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
me to look at that data whereas other
 
02:39:59.309 --> 02:39:59.319 align:start position:0%
people can't look at that data we need
 
02:40:01.590 --> 02:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
to have um that be part of this bill as
 
02:40:04.150 --> 02:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
well and what I suggested a little bit
 
02:40:06.190 --> 02:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
was a way to do that so I think it's a
 
02:40:08.590 --> 02:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
great Bill the way it is um it can even
 
02:40:10.990 --> 02:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
be strengthened and and move forward in
 
02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
that direction thank
 
02:40:16.830 --> 02:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you Miss W for joining us on
 
02:40:20.230 --> 02:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
this so question for members of the
 
02:40:26.710 --> 02:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:29.630 --> 02:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
electronically I'm not seeing any other
 
02:40:31.510 --> 02:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
so miss Walter just for clarification
 
02:40:34.830 --> 02:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
for my notes so you're speaking of uh
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
possible information exchange or release
 
02:40:39.990 --> 02:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
that is not currently in the bill that
 
02:40:41.870 --> 02:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
you have suggested an amendment to
 
02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:43.710 align:start position:0%
you have suggested an amendment to
someone

02:40:43.710 --> 02:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
someone
 
02:40:46.469 --> 02:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
for yes if I can hear you correctly I'm
 
02:40:49.469 --> 02:40:49.479 align:start position:0%
sorry my hearing is not very good um yes
 
02:40:53.070 --> 02:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
i u sent an an email letter to every
 
02:40:55.550 --> 02:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
member of the committee suggesting a
 
02:40:59.550 --> 02:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
slight modification in the first section
 
02:41:03.150 --> 02:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
um Roman numeral four um of the bill I
 
02:41:06.750 --> 02:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
think it's the first section um and that
 
02:41:09.469 --> 02:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
would be an idea but again I you guys
 
02:41:10.990 --> 02:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
you folks know a whole lot more than I
 
02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
do about these matters I'm only a
 
02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:15.670 align:start position:0%
do about these matters I'm only a
biologist

02:41:15.670 --> 02:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
biologist
 
02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
um close to atici too so I just wanted
 
02:41:22.269 --> 02:41:22.279 align:start position:0%
to highlight that so if members of the
 
02:41:24.510 --> 02:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
committee are looking at that that
 
02:41:26.469 --> 02:41:26.479 align:start position:0%
they're aware that that's out there
 
02:41:28.550 --> 02:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
because it's not in the bill in front of
 
02:41:30.910 --> 02:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
us are there any further questions for
 
02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:34.030 align:start position:0%
us are there any further questions for
Miss

02:41:34.030 --> 02:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:36.670 --> 02:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
wther I'm not seeing any thank you very
 
02:41:39.190 --> 02:41:39.200 align:start position:0%

02:41:41.670 --> 02:41:41.680 align:start position:0%

02:41:44.790 --> 02:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
morning is Louise Spencer Lise I have
 
02:41:46.830 --> 02:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
you are with us if you unmute I think we
 
02:41:49.510 --> 02:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
will be all set
 
02:41:51.190 --> 02:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you again Madame
 
02:41:53.389 --> 02:41:53.399 align:start position:0%
chair for taking my testimony thank you
 
02:41:55.870 --> 02:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
to the committee uh for the record my
 
02:41:59.190 --> 02:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
name is Louise Spencer I live in conquer
 
02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
and um I am here in support of HB
 
02:42:06.550 --> 02:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
428 um I've spent quite a bit of time
 
02:42:09.150 --> 02:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
over the last few years working on
 
02:42:10.429 --> 02:42:10.439 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with a fair
 
02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
redistricting process and um was am
 
02:42:17.469 --> 02:42:17.479 align:start position:0%
supportive of the idea of an independent
 
02:42:17.479 --> 02:42:19.349 align:start position:0%
supportive of the idea of an independent
redistricting

02:42:19.349 --> 02:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
02:42:22.230 --> 02:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
Mission however I know that despite
 
02:42:24.830 --> 02:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support for that approach
 
02:42:27.750 --> 02:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
there remain members who have concerns
 
02:42:29.230 --> 02:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
about the
 
02:42:31.790 --> 02:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of such an approach
 
02:42:33.950 --> 02:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
none of those concerns apply to this
 
02:42:36.790 --> 02:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
bill and I believe this bill goes a long
 
02:42:40.190 --> 02:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
way in accomplishing many important
 
02:42:43.309 --> 02:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
goals in terms of
 
02:42:46.550 --> 02:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
transparency fairness and citizen
 
02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
engagement and participation
 
02:42:51.750 --> 02:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
um and for that reason I strongly
 
02:42:57.230 --> 02:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
support it um I think we live in a time
 
02:43:02.269 --> 02:43:02.279 align:start position:0%
where we are divided um along political
 
02:43:06.070 --> 02:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
lines in ways that that we haven't seen
 
02:43:07.550 --> 02:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps in
 
02:43:11.230 --> 02:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
Generations um and that part of the way
 
02:43:17.990 --> 02:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
we get back to a more um integrated and
 
02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:19.910 align:start position:0%
we get back to a more um integrated and
um

02:43:19.910 --> 02:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:21.190 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:43:21.190 --> 02:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:27.269 --> 02:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
approachable Civic um environment is by
 
02:43:30.150 --> 02:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
creating some guard rails that help
 
02:43:33.510 --> 02:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
everyone build trust in our systems and
 
02:43:36.750 --> 02:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
I think this bill creates a lot of great
 
02:43:40.349 --> 02:43:40.359 align:start position:0%
guard rails for the redistricting
 
02:43:43.750 --> 02:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
process and one that will allow people
 
02:43:47.469 --> 02:43:47.479 align:start position:0%
across the political Spectrum to buy
 
02:43:51.790 --> 02:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
into and come away then feeling that uh
 
02:43:54.269 --> 02:43:54.279 align:start position:0%
there was fairness and transparency so
 
02:43:57.550 --> 02:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
for those reasons I would strongly
 
02:44:01.469 --> 02:44:01.479 align:start position:0%
encourage you to support this bill um
 
02:44:03.950 --> 02:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
and to move it out of committee in a
 
02:44:07.990 --> 02:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan way to show your commitment
 
02:44:10.070 --> 02:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
um as this committee so often has done
 
02:44:14.469 --> 02:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
in the past to bipartisan solutions to
 
02:44:17.429 --> 02:44:17.439 align:start position:0%
to problems and issues so thank you very
 
02:44:20.429 --> 02:44:20.439 align:start position:0%
much thank you for testify on this bill
 
02:44:22.790 --> 02:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
with us this afternoon is there any
 
02:44:24.670 --> 02:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
member of the committee either present
 
02:44:28.429 --> 02:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
or electronically who has a question for
 
02:44:31.389 --> 02:44:31.399 align:start position:0%

02:44:39.990 --> 02:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
suan Richmond Miss Richmond you are with
 
02:44:42.110 --> 02:44:42.120 align:start position:0%

all

02:44:43.030 --> 02:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:44:45.910 --> 02:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
set uh thank you madam chair and and
 
02:44:48.150 --> 02:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much to the committee for
 
02:44:50.590 --> 02:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
accepting my testimony I'm speaking in
 
02:44:52.190 --> 02:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill
 
02:44:56.230 --> 02:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
428 I live in Durham and on January 11th
 
02:44:59.150 --> 02:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
of this year the Town Council of Durham
 
02:45:02.670 --> 02:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
supported 9 to zero a resolution for
 
02:45:04.429 --> 02:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan Fair
 
02:45:07.230 --> 02:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
redistricting uh with transparency I
 
02:45:08.710 --> 02:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
think at the time we were hoping it
 
02:45:11.150 --> 02:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
would be a committee but I'm sure In The
 
02:45:15.110 --> 02:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
Same Spirit uh house built 428 addresses
 
02:45:16.469 --> 02:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
many of the same
 
02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
concerns uh Governor sonunu repeated in
 
02:45:20.790 --> 02:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
since New Hampshire doesn't have a
 
02:45:24.349 --> 02:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
history of Jerry mandering but that is
 
02:45:27.030 --> 02:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
not true the New Hampshire Constitution
 
02:45:29.230 --> 02:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
part two article 11 states when the
 
02:45:31.150 --> 02:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
population of any town or Ward according
 
02:45:33.510 --> 02:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
to the last federal census is within a
 
02:45:36.110 --> 02:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable deviation from the ideal
 
02:45:37.269 --> 02:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
population for one or more
 
02:45:39.309 --> 02:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
representative seats the town or Ward
 
02:45:42.349 --> 02:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
shall have its own District of one or
 
02:45:44.269 --> 02:45:44.279 align:start position:0%
more representative seats and informing
 
02:45:46.910 --> 02:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
the districts the boundaries of towns ws
 
02:45:49.190 --> 02:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
and unincorporated places shall be
 
02:45:51.030 --> 02:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
preserved and
 
02:45:53.630 --> 02:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
contiguous so at our last redistricting
 
02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:54.550 align:start position:0%
contiguous so at our last redistricting
in

02:45:54.550 --> 02:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:45:57.269 --> 02:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
2011 every municipality with a
 
02:45:58.710 --> 02:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
population of
 
02:46:02.590 --> 02:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
3,290 or more was entitled to its own
 
02:46:02.600 --> 02:46:04.150 align:start position:0%
3,290 or more was entitled to its own
exclusive

02:46:04.150 --> 02:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
exclusive
 
02:46:08.389 --> 02:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative but 62 out of the 152
 
02:46:09.830 --> 02:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
towns and Wards in New Hampshire that
 
02:46:11.990 --> 02:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
qualified for their own representatives
 
02:46:14.550 --> 02:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
were denied their own seat in the house
 
02:46:14.560 --> 02:46:16.550 align:start position:0%
were denied their own seat in the house
that's

02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:46:19.230 --> 02:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
40.8% more than a third of New
 
02:46:22.070 --> 02:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's towns and Wards were
 
02:46:24.990 --> 02:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised of having a full voice
 
02:46:27.710 --> 02:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
that would be gerrymandering and further
 
02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
that L three districting did break up
 
02:46:32.950 --> 02:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
cities towns and Wards to create
 
02:46:34.910 --> 02:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative districts without
 
02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
contiguous borders so despite what the
 
02:46:42.070 --> 02:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
governor has said it's not true that we
 
02:46:45.150 --> 02:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
do not Jerry Mander in New Hampshire and
 
02:46:47.950 --> 02:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
it's further not enough just to say well
 
02:46:50.190 --> 02:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
I trust the legislature they will do
 
02:46:52.670 --> 02:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
what's right because the temptation to
 
02:46:54.830 --> 02:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
draw redistricting lines that will
 
02:46:57.750 --> 02:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
protect your position or benefit your
 
02:46:59.750 --> 02:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
party has got to be overwhelming you
 
02:47:02.269 --> 02:47:02.279 align:start position:0%
don't ask the fox to watch the hen house
 
02:47:04.710 --> 02:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
unless you plan to keep careful watch on
 
02:47:09.309 --> 02:47:09.319 align:start position:0%
the fox so in our last regist excuse me
 
02:47:13.429 --> 02:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
in 2011 Maps were drawn in secret and
 
02:47:15.389 --> 02:47:15.399 align:start position:0%
the software being used is still secret
 
02:47:17.590 --> 02:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
today and the public didn't get to see
 
02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
the maps until the day before they were
 
02:47:23.230 --> 02:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
voted on members of the legislature made
 
02:47:25.070 --> 02:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
their requisite visits to every County
 
02:47:27.950 --> 02:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
to discuss redistricting but they had no
 
02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
Maps so that is the context in which we
 
02:47:36.590 --> 02:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
are asking for transparency now h428
 
02:47:39.150 --> 02:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
would not deprive the legislature of its
 
02:47:41.510 --> 02:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility to draw new maps it just
 
02:47:43.830 --> 02:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
provides communities with their right to
 
02:47:47.030 --> 02:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
view the maps to provide input and you
 
02:47:49.510 --> 02:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
our Representatives can Ure the people
 
02:47:51.990 --> 02:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
you represent they will have fair and
 
02:47:54.750 --> 02:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
equal representation transparency is not
 
02:47:57.750 --> 02:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
a threat when the work's done fairly HP
 
02:48:00.389 --> 02:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
428 would give us government that
 
02:48:02.309 --> 02:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
everyone could trust and believe in so
 
02:48:05.230 --> 02:48:05.240 align:start position:0%

02:48:07.190 --> 02:48:07.200 align:start position:0%

Clement toich pointed out uh
 
02:49:00.510 --> 02:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
transparency is inherent in our state
 
02:49:04.349 --> 02:49:04.359 align:start position:0%
constitution and the holding hearings on
 
02:49:07.309 --> 02:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
bills I I don't know Pam if you're on

02:49:14.670 --> 02:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
we're all back you froze up I think it
 
02:49:16.990 --> 02:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
might have been our
 
02:49:20.590 --> 02:49:20.600 align:start position:0%
system okay I will back up a bit I'll

lobbyist I am a volunteer and I'm
 
02:49:35.870 --> 02:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
speaking in support of House Bill
 
02:49:39.030 --> 02:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
428 because it encourages the very kind
 
02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:39.950 align:start position:0%
428 because it encourages the very kind
of

02:49:39.950 --> 02:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:49:42.229 --> 02:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
transparency that this committee and
 
02:49:45.269 --> 02:49:45.279 align:start position:0%
this legislature should be so proud of
 
02:49:46.910 --> 02:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that you're holding these
 
02:49:49.870 --> 02:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
meetings remotely so that we the public
 
02:49:51.389 --> 02:49:51.399 align:start position:0%
can attend and
 
02:49:53.990 --> 02:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
participate shows your commitment to
 
02:49:57.469 --> 02:49:57.479 align:start position:0%
that and I ask that you continue that
 
02:50:00.309 --> 02:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
commitment by supporting this
 
02:50:03.710 --> 02:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
bill I sent you some very detailed
 
02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:04.910 align:start position:0%
bill I sent you some very detailed
written

02:50:04.910 --> 02:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
written
 
02:50:08.229 --> 02:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
testimony that explains why that trans
 
02:50:13.269 --> 02:50:13.279 align:start position:0%
how that transparency did not happen in
 
02:50:16.309 --> 02:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
2011 many people in the public many
 
02:50:19.349 --> 02:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
voters were angered by that uh many
 
02:50:21.830 --> 02:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
legislators were frustrated by that lack
 
02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:22.790 align:start position:0%
legislators were frustrated by that lack
of

02:50:22.790 --> 02:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:50:26.349 --> 02:50:26.359 align:start position:0%
transparency we will do better in 2021
 
02:50:29.110 --> 02:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm confident of that because the
 
02:50:32.510 --> 02:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
public is now demanding that involvement
 
02:50:35.870 --> 02:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
so posting plans maps and public comment
 
02:50:39.950 --> 02:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
on a website as this bill uh describes
 
02:50:43.990 --> 02:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
as one part of it those meetings in the
 
02:50:46.750 --> 02:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
10 counties are very much a part of the
 
02:50:49.670 --> 02:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
tradition in 2011 they were held but
 
02:50:51.469 --> 02:50:51.479 align:start position:0%
there was nothing there to talk about
 
02:50:55.110 --> 02:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
there was no real input or discussion
 
02:50:58.110 --> 02:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
about Maps because nothing was shown
 
02:51:00.910 --> 02:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't happen this year uh
 
02:51:02.910 --> 02:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin you asked whether
 
02:51:04.910 --> 02:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
there should be a fiscal note attached
 
02:51:07.870 --> 02:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
to this I believe there will be a fiscal
 
02:51:09.790 --> 02:51:09.800 align:start position:0%
note that will have to be attached to
 
02:51:12.349 --> 02:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
the bill that sets up the Committees
 
02:51:15.469 --> 02:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
which you have not heard yet and so this
 
02:51:17.790 --> 02:51:17.800 align:start position:0%
would be part of the committee's
 
02:51:21.269 --> 02:51:21.279 align:start position:0%
operating budget if you will um to
 
02:51:25.389 --> 02:51:25.399 align:start position:0%
include the the the website the um
 
02:51:29.590 --> 02:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
noticing of public hearings and so on um
 
02:51:32.510 --> 02:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
so on on that ground and the fact that
 
02:51:35.510 --> 02:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
the public really wants to continue in a
 
02:51:36.910 --> 02:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
spirit of
 
02:51:39.670 --> 02:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
transparency so that we can have trust
 
02:51:41.910 --> 02:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
again in the districts and in our
 
02:51:44.510 --> 02:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
government I strongly urge you to
 
02:51:47.150 --> 02:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
support this bill if there are any
 
02:51:49.510 --> 02:51:49.520 align:start position:0%

aivia zinc and I'm the executive
 
02:52:38.830 --> 02:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
director of open democracy action um
 
02:52:41.150 --> 02:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
we're a nonpartisan nonprofit based here
 
02:52:44.510 --> 02:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
in conquered um that works on fixing our
 
02:52:47.429 --> 02:52:47.439 align:start position:0%
democracy I'm here to speak in favor of
 
02:52:50.429 --> 02:52:50.439 align:start position:0%
house bill um for TW
 
02:52:54.830 --> 02:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
28 um on Friday February 12th the Census
 
02:52:57.150 --> 02:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
Bureau announced a timeline for
 
02:53:00.110 --> 02:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
releasing um this redistricting data to
 
02:53:03.990 --> 02:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
the states of September 30th of this
 
02:53:06.910 --> 02:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
year um also the National Conference on
 
02:53:11.030 --> 02:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
State Legislature um released an article
 
02:53:14.269 --> 02:53:14.279 align:start position:0%
five ways to handle the census delay and
 
02:53:17.030 --> 02:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
I think that this piece of legislation
 
02:53:22.229 --> 02:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
page two line 11 through 13 um requiring
 
02:53:25.110 --> 02:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
the committee to um establish the
 
02:53:27.309 --> 02:53:27.319 align:start position:0%
criteria of how they're going to draw
 
02:53:31.790 --> 02:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
the districts um is a great idea and
 
02:53:33.990 --> 02:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
also gives them time to do that before
 
02:53:36.550 --> 02:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
the Census Data is Al
 
02:53:39.910 --> 02:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
allowed I hope that their um data that
 
02:53:41.870 --> 02:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
they you or the criteria that they
 
02:53:44.269 --> 02:53:44.279 align:start position:0%
publish is that the districts shall
 
02:53:45.670 --> 02:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
comply with the New Hampshire
 
02:53:48.150 --> 02:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the US Constitution and
 
02:53:50.349 --> 02:53:50.359 align:start position:0%
the Voting Rights Act of
 
02:53:54.269 --> 02:53:54.279 align:start position:0%
1965 um the districts are based on on
 
02:53:57.190 --> 02:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
inh inhabitants they're
 
02:54:00.550 --> 02:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
contiguous um that no racial minorities
 
02:54:06.389 --> 02:54:06.399 align:start position:0%
are are um District did in any form um
 
02:54:08.389 --> 02:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
that we respect the integrities of our
 
02:54:12.030 --> 02:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
communities of interest um and don't
 
02:54:16.190 --> 02:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
divide any towns or Wards in those towns
 
02:54:19.030 --> 02:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
um as others have spoke of um
 
02:54:22.030 --> 02:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
the last redistricting process 10 years
 
02:54:24.910 --> 02:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
ago did not respect New Hampshire's
 
02:54:28.469 --> 02:54:28.479 align:start position:0%
Constitution um 62 towns were denied
 
02:54:30.710 --> 02:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
their uh
 
02:54:34.229 --> 02:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
representation um I am also um footnoted
 
02:54:38.030 --> 02:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
um house Journal um from 10 years ago um
 
02:54:40.910 --> 02:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
that cites that the maps were only given
 
02:54:44.269 --> 02:54:44.279 align:start position:0%
to the public 24 hours notice the last
 
02:54:46.870 --> 02:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
time and I urge that we can do better
 
02:54:48.910 --> 02:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
this round and how SP
 
02:54:48.920 --> 02:54:50.710 align:start position:0%
this round and how SP
um

02:54:50.710 --> 02:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:53.750 --> 02:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
428 really does provide
 
02:54:57.510 --> 02:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
transparency and a process where voters
 
02:54:59.429 --> 02:54:59.439 align:start position:0%
will know that this is a two-way
 
02:55:01.110 --> 02:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
conversation between voters and their
 
02:55:01.120 --> 02:55:02.389 align:start position:0%
conversation between voters and their
elected

02:55:02.389 --> 02:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
elected
 
02:55:05.710 --> 02:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
officials this bipartisan Bill calls for
 
02:55:08.269 --> 02:55:08.279 align:start position:0%
fairness in the
 
02:55:11.469 --> 02:55:11.479 align:start position:0%
process I think you've you can identify
 
02:55:15.190 --> 02:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
comments that were made um and on other
 
02:55:18.309 --> 02:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
actions that really citizens want a f
 
02:55:21.910 --> 02:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
Fair nonpartisan and transparent process
 
02:55:24.710 --> 02:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
and this is an opportunity for us to not
 
02:55:27.469 --> 02:55:27.479 align:start position:0%
just take those words but also put them
 
02:55:30.190 --> 02:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
into action by by passing this law so
 
02:55:31.630 --> 02:55:31.640 align:start position:0%

going on it sounds as clear as day the
 
03:59:27.389 --> 03:59:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:31.110 --> 03:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
soul need to be reminded all right we
 
03:59:34.590 --> 03:59:34.600 align:start position:0%

03:59:37.790 --> 03:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
1:32 for notice executive session on
 
03:59:41.950 --> 03:59:41.960 align:start position:0%
certain bills before we get going um I
 
03:59:44.070 --> 03:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
want to let committee members know a a
 
03:59:45.590 --> 03:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
little bit about
 
03:59:48.429 --> 03:59:48.439 align:start position:0%
scheduling we are scheduled for two
 
03:59:50.910 --> 03:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
session days next
 
03:59:55.710 --> 03:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
week um I have opted not to schedule
 
03:59:58.389 --> 03:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
election law on Friday next week given
 
04:00:01.590 --> 04:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
that we will be doing business for two
 
04:00:04.309 --> 04:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
pretty much two pretty much full days
 
04:00:06.870 --> 04:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
though other committees are meeting if I
 
04:00:09.950 --> 04:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
hear committee members begging to meet
 
04:00:11.830 --> 04:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
on Friday there I have just been
 
04:00:14.149 --> 04:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
informed this room is open no one has
 
04:00:17.429 --> 04:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
taken it and I will be happy to schedule
 
04:00:21.189 --> 04:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
it on Friday um however my plan would be
 
04:00:24.910 --> 04:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
for the first two weeks in March I have
 
04:00:27.110 --> 04:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
asked for three
 
04:00:29.510 --> 04:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
days um
 
04:00:33.229 --> 04:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
so uh that is the plan and it will be I
 
04:00:36.670 --> 04:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
have asked for a Wednesdays or
 
04:00:41.189 --> 04:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
Friday so as soon as I have those days I
 
04:00:43.229 --> 04:00:43.239 align:start position:0%
will send an email out that those are
 
04:00:45.149 --> 04:00:45.159 align:start position:0%
the days I will be scheduling public
 
04:00:46.990 --> 04:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
hearings on and probably another
 
04:00:50.309 --> 04:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
executive session I expect those days to
 
04:00:53.630 --> 04:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
be long because my intent is to schedule
 
04:00:56.870 --> 04:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
the acente ballot bills there are a
 
04:01:00.269 --> 04:01:00.279 align:start position:0%
number of them and I am expecting the
 
04:01:04.030 --> 04:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
public hearings on those bills alone to
 
04:01:05.950 --> 04:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
be at least a
 
04:01:08.950 --> 04:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
day and I might schedu them for more
 
04:01:12.510 --> 04:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
than a day so that's the sort of status
 
04:01:12.520 --> 04:01:14.229 align:start position:0%
than a day so that's the sort of status
of

04:01:14.229 --> 04:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:01:15.990 --> 04:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
the scheduling for the next few weeks
 
04:01:18.790 --> 04:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative quy thank you m so
 
04:01:20.990 --> 04:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
scheduled a total of three days for
 
04:01:25.030 --> 04:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
those two weeks that's my plan we have
 
04:01:28.670 --> 04:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
until I think the 18th to finish our
 
04:01:30.950 --> 04:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
voting I'm not quite sure I might be off
 
04:01:33.189 --> 04:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
a week it's in the
 
04:01:35.990 --> 04:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
calendar have basically march to finish
 
04:01:41.110 --> 04:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
up the bill so that's my my goal but
 
04:01:43.670 --> 04:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
these public hearings I think we can get
 
04:01:45.149 --> 04:01:45.159 align:start position:0%
the public hearings on the remaining
 
04:01:48.149 --> 04:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
bills done in three days we have 18
 
04:01:48.159 --> 04:01:50.030 align:start position:0%
bills done in three days we have 18
bills

04:01:50.030 --> 04:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:01:52.510 --> 04:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
left that is the status anybody else
 
04:01:53.750 --> 04:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
have any
 
04:01:55.750 --> 04:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
questions yeah Madam chair could you
 
04:01:58.830 --> 04:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
repeat the days next week well no next
 
04:02:01.110 --> 04:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
week we just we have house session on
 
04:02:04.309 --> 04:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and Thursday okay since we
 
04:02:07.309 --> 04:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
meet on Friday normally I said we will
 
04:02:09.790 --> 04:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
not meet on Friday since we've already
 
04:02:11.510 --> 04:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
everybody's already spending two days
 
04:02:13.590 --> 04:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
but over the next two weeks one week
 
04:02:16.349 --> 04:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
will have two
 
04:02:19.590 --> 04:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
days all right but if you want to meet
 
04:02:21.269 --> 04:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
on Friday apparently this room is
 
04:02:22.990 --> 04:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
available even and I could have a
 
04:02:25.590 --> 04:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
meeting about a couple of bills or most
 
04:02:28.229 --> 04:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
people were happy when I said today not
 
04:02:30.670 --> 04:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
to come in for the committee Mee but I
 
04:02:32.510 --> 04:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
think we can get it done without three
 
04:02:35.030 --> 04:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
days coming in on Friday next
 
04:02:37.469 --> 04:02:37.479 align:start position:0%
week all right so for notice this
 
04:02:39.309 --> 04:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
afternoon the first bill we have noticed
 
04:02:41.590 --> 04:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
for executive session today is
 
04:02:44.750 --> 04:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
sb2 I am going to continue the executive
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
session on
 
04:02:49.710 --> 04:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
sb2 I had a question that I
 
04:02:52.630 --> 04:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh sent over to the Secretary of State's
 
04:02:54.590 --> 04:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
office between the public hearing and
 
04:02:57.309 --> 04:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
today requesting information on how many
 
04:02:59.189 --> 04:02:59.199 align:start position:0%
communities had actually
 
04:03:00.950 --> 04:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
rescheduled and when they were
 
04:03:03.110 --> 04:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
rescheduling for and they've been pretty
 
04:03:04.990 --> 04:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
busy they haven't been able to get back
 
04:03:08.710 --> 04:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
to me and uh since the towns are able to
 
04:03:10.590 --> 04:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
continue to operate under the emergency
 
04:03:14.670 --> 04:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
order 83 I think um
 
04:03:17.550 --> 04:03:17.560 align:start position:0%
I think we can move on from sb2 it's not
 
04:03:19.349 --> 04:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
technically an early
 
04:03:22.110 --> 04:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
Bill the next bill that we have
 
04:03:26.229 --> 04:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
scheduled for executive session is CAC
 
04:03:29.429 --> 04:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
R4 in regards to
 
04:03:32.229 --> 04:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
redistricting this is u a bill that
 
04:03:34.229 --> 04:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
provides that an independent districting
 
04:03:36.990 --> 04:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
commission shall be established to draw
 
04:03:39.790 --> 04:03:39.800 align:start position:0%
braries for state and federal Offices
 
04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
this is a cacr and not a house bill is
 
04:03:47.550 --> 04:03:47.560 align:start position:0%
there a motion on this representative
 
04:03:51.149 --> 04:03:51.159 align:start position:0%
brow Madam chair I moved cacr 4 in
 
04:03:54.630 --> 04:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate this propos is
 
04:03:58.070 --> 04:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
there a second to the representative's
 
04:04:00.830 --> 04:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
motion that's been moved and second it
 
04:04:03.429 --> 04:04:03.439 align:start position:0%
thank you all right would you like to
 
04:04:05.870 --> 04:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
speak to your yes I would M thank you
 
04:04:07.990 --> 04:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
this proposed Constitutional Amendment
 
04:04:11.349 --> 04:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
would independent districting commission
 
04:04:13.469 --> 04:04:13.479 align:start position:0%
the stated reason for this amendment is
 
04:04:15.910 --> 04:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
that it would make redistricting the
 
04:04:18.149 --> 04:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
redistricting process
 
04:04:20.910 --> 04:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan however the appointment of a
 
04:04:23.389 --> 04:04:23.399 align:start position:0%
committee established for this purpose
 
04:04:25.870 --> 04:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
would itself be a partisan process which
 
04:04:28.349 --> 04:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
would in reality be controlled by the
 
04:04:30.910 --> 04:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
majority party further this proposed
 
04:04:32.750 --> 04:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
amendment does not address how the
 
04:04:35.630 --> 04:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
commission would be appointed so even
 
04:04:37.870 --> 04:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
establishing rules for the makeup of the
 
04:04:39.870 --> 04:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
commission and for how it would be
 
04:04:42.510 --> 04:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
appointed would be partisan New
 
04:04:45.070 --> 04:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has the large legislative body
 
04:04:47.030 --> 04:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the United States this makes our
 
04:04:49.309 --> 04:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
legislature the most representative
 
04:04:51.590 --> 04:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
group Commission of the people if you
 
04:04:54.429 --> 04:04:54.439 align:start position:0%
will to perform this constitutional
 
04:04:54.439 --> 04:04:56.030 align:start position:0%
will to perform this constitutional
responsibility

political parties further insulates
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
redistricting from the will of New
 
04:05:07.910 --> 04:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire voters I urge that this task
 
04:05:10.469 --> 04:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
continue to be done as charged in our
 
04:05:13.110 --> 04:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution and not be delegated to an
 
04:05:15.870 --> 04:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
appointed commission please support the
 
04:05:19.910 --> 04:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
motion of I for cacf
 
04:05:23.309 --> 04:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
4 thank you does anybody else want to
 
04:05:27.429 --> 04:05:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:33.309 --> 04:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:36.870 --> 04:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
anybody I'm not seeing
 
04:05:41.309 --> 04:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:45.630 --> 04:05:45.640 align:start position:0%
call the motion on the floor is to itl
 
04:05:48.990 --> 04:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
there is a hand up sorry there is a hand
 
04:05:54.309 --> 04:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:57.469 --> 04:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
Lane I don't I don't know if this is the
 
04:06:00.510 --> 04:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate time to ask the question um
 
04:06:04.269 --> 04:06:04.279 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that one of the
 
04:06:07.030 --> 04:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
major reasons for the opposition to the
 
04:06:10.309 --> 04:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
bill is that this the Constitution does
 
04:06:13.070 --> 04:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
not does not specifically provide that
 
04:06:16.550 --> 04:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
we can delegate that so this would so I
 
04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
guess my question is
 
04:06:23.750 --> 04:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:25.670 --> 04:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
would if we can't do it by
 
04:06:27.670 --> 04:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment then how do we
 
04:06:27.680 --> 04:06:30.389 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment then how do we
do

04:06:30.389 --> 04:06:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:33.189 --> 04:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
it like sure if you want to answer that
 
04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
representative BR go ahead thank you for
 
04:06:38.349 --> 04:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
your question um I do not believe there
 
04:06:41.269 --> 04:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
should be a commission because I believe
 
04:06:44.309 --> 04:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
that uh a commission very quickly will
 
04:06:46.429 --> 04:06:46.439 align:start position:0%
become fully as partisan or more
 
04:06:48.870 --> 04:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
partisan than than the current process
 
04:06:51.550 --> 04:06:51.560 align:start position:0%
and I believe that since we have the
 
04:06:54.149 --> 04:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
largest legislative body in the nation
 
04:06:57.349 --> 04:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
especially since that we already have a
 
04:06:59.070 --> 04:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
commission that is appointed by the
 
04:07:01.510 --> 04:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
people to do this process so I don't
 
04:07:03.189 --> 04:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
believe we should have a commission that
 
04:07:07.229 --> 04:07:07.239 align:start position:0%
is legislatively established or that is
 
04:07:10.710 --> 04:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
approved by a change in the
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution may I have a followup
 
04:07:14.830 --> 04:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
please ative
 
04:07:19.269 --> 04:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
goe um so you you're saying that the the
 
04:07:22.070 --> 04:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
existing committee is appointed by the
 
04:07:24.630 --> 04:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
voters my understanding is that the
 
04:07:26.750 --> 04:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
existing that the new committee or how
 
04:07:28.510 --> 04:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
it's done I've never gone through this
 
04:07:29.710 --> 04:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
process as a
 
04:07:32.710 --> 04:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
legislator is appointed in fact by the
 
04:07:35.830 --> 04:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
parties not by the people is my
 
04:07:35.840 --> 04:07:36.790 align:start position:0%
parties not by the people is my
understanding

04:07:36.790 --> 04:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
correct the r it's it's appointed by the
 
04:07:45.990 --> 04:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
majority and it's the speaker committee
 
04:07:47.950 --> 04:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
so I when you say parties I don't know
 
04:07:50.389 --> 04:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
what you mean
 
04:07:53.870 --> 04:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
representatively so responding to his
 
04:07:56.469 --> 04:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
comment that the existing committee
 
04:07:59.870 --> 04:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
process was done by the people my
 
04:08:02.469 --> 04:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
understanding is exactly as you said it
 
04:08:04.990 --> 04:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
which I would say is not by the people
 
04:08:07.269 --> 04:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure I
 
04:08:09.389 --> 04:08:09.399 align:start position:0%
understood how it's done because I've
 
04:08:11.630 --> 04:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
never been involved in
 
04:08:14.550 --> 04:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
it it's my understand
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
that persons that will serve on the
 
04:08:19.550 --> 04:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
committee will be elected
 
04:08:21.710 --> 04:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
representatives and I understand your
 
04:08:23.710 --> 04:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
point as to the constitutionality that
 
04:08:26.550 --> 04:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is intended to remedy that
 
04:08:29.109 --> 04:08:29.119 align:start position:0%
complaint um and I think representative
 
04:08:30.950 --> 04:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
growan if I'm paraphrasing correctly
 
04:08:33.550 --> 04:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
your point is we already have all the
 
04:08:35.389 --> 04:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
representatives here we don't need
 
04:08:35.399 --> 04:08:39.389 align:start position:0%
representatives here we don't need
further

04:08:39.389 --> 04:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:41.710 --> 04:08:41.720 align:start position:0%
delineations any other comment I I will
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
just say I've spent a lot of time
 
04:08:44.870 --> 04:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
looking at other States and I have found
 
04:08:46.750 --> 04:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
that in some other states where they do
 
04:08:49.070 --> 04:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
this in their constitution sort of
 
04:08:52.590 --> 04:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
interesting that they do it for example
 
04:08:55.510 --> 04:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
the congressional district and that's
 
04:08:58.229 --> 04:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
all that's in their constitution that
 
04:08:59.750 --> 04:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
they leave the other
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
districts um for the legislature to do
 
04:09:04.630 --> 04:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
so that's sort of an interesting thing
 
04:09:06.229 --> 04:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
and some of the states that do have it
 
04:09:07.990 --> 04:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
in their constitution they do it for
 
04:09:08.000 --> 04:09:10.790 align:start position:0%
in their constitution they do it for
specific

04:09:10.790 --> 04:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
specific
 
04:09:13.590 --> 04:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
places is there any other discussion on
 
04:09:13.600 --> 04:09:16.550 align:start position:0%
places is there any other discussion on
this

04:09:16.550 --> 04:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:21.030 --> 04:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:23.870 --> 04:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
any all right I'm not seeing any so I'm
 
04:09:32.269 --> 04:09:32.279 align:start position:0%

have all been set an amendment 377 which
 
04:17:14.550 --> 04:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
one I see a few more heads raised I'm
 
04:17:17.269 --> 04:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
presume people have looked at in a few
 
04:17:19.910 --> 04:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
seconds and then I'm recognize the of
 
04:17:25.149 --> 04:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:27.670 --> 04:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
to Madam chair I had a great deal of
 
04:17:31.910 --> 04:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:35.189 --> 04:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
you we we are about to consider an
 
04:17:39.950 --> 04:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:42.990 --> 04:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
hb77 so representative Barry why don't
 
04:17:44.349 --> 04:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
talk about the bill and what your
 
04:17:47.309 --> 04:17:47.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment does thank you um yes Madam
 
04:17:51.309 --> 04:17:51.319 align:start position:0%
chairman so we heard testimony um about
 
04:17:54.630 --> 04:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
hb77 which just refresh our memory is
 
04:17:57.229 --> 04:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
requiring the city and town flarks to
 
04:18:00.269 --> 04:18:00.279 align:start position:0%
report daily to the Secretary of State's
 
04:18:03.309 --> 04:18:03.319 align:start position:0%
office the people who have registered to
 
04:18:05.750 --> 04:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
work for office um there's a couple
 
04:18:09.149 --> 04:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
issues raised um to two which are both
 
04:18:11.269 --> 04:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
addressed in this amendment the first of
 
04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
which is that there is current stat
 
04:18:17.309 --> 04:18:17.319 align:start position:0%
um which is RSA
 
04:18:20.149 --> 04:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
6558 so instead of creating a new
 
04:18:22.389 --> 04:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
section we're just going to go into the
 
04:18:24.910 --> 04:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
existing section which deals with the
 
04:18:26.510 --> 04:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
clerks notifying the Secretary of
 
04:18:29.070 --> 04:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
State's office of the fil for office um
 
04:18:32.030 --> 04:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
and the second one uh which was raised
 
04:18:35.309 --> 04:18:35.319 align:start position:0%
which is what do we do with um clks who
 
04:18:37.910 --> 04:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
aren't especially for smaller towns for
 
04:18:40.590 --> 04:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
clerks who are not open um five days a
 
04:18:44.070 --> 04:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
week so what the what the second what
 
04:18:45.309 --> 04:18:45.319 align:start position:0%
the second part of this amendment does
 
04:18:48.030 --> 04:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
is it clarifies that if your off if the
 
04:18:51.630 --> 04:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
clerk's office is not open and receiving
 
04:18:53.830 --> 04:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
um filings for office that they do not
 
04:18:55.790 --> 04:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
have to report so they if they are open
 
04:18:56.990 --> 04:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
and they are receiving they have to
 
04:18:58.389 --> 04:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
report if they're not open and they're
 
04:19:00.710 --> 04:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
not receiving they do not have and I'm
 
04:19:02.670 --> 04:19:02.680 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any I didn't work with
 
04:19:07.189 --> 04:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
the original sponsor of this bill um on
 
04:19:09.790 --> 04:19:09.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment he approves of it and I'm
 
04:19:11.309 --> 04:19:11.319 align:start position:0%
obviously happy to answer any questions
 
04:19:16.590 --> 04:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:21.550 --> 04:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
i i i w to actually read the amendment
 
04:19:25.030 --> 04:19:25.040 align:start position:0%

this david. scan at I can do that SOS do

I just did that Madam chair he's got it
 
04:19:38.030 --> 04:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
all right okay um because what it
 
04:19:39.590 --> 04:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
provides for people that may be
 
04:19:43.229 --> 04:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
listening is City and town clerk provide
 
04:19:45.429 --> 04:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
to the Secretary of State on at least a
 
04:19:48.590 --> 04:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
daily basis a summary of any filings
 
04:19:50.429 --> 04:19:50.439 align:start position:0%

04:19:52.910 --> 04:19:52.920 align:start position:0%

electronically and shall include the
 
04:19:56.830 --> 04:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
name and address of any candidate who is
 
04:19:59.469 --> 04:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
filed the Secretary of State shall then
 
04:20:01.469 --> 04:20:01.479 align:start position:0%
add those persons to the Daily report
 
04:20:04.229 --> 04:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
for that day clerk shall only be
 
04:20:06.109 --> 04:20:06.119 align:start position:0%
required to report to the Secretary of
 
04:20:08.469 --> 04:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
State pursuant to this section on days
 
04:20:10.830 --> 04:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
the clerk's offices are open and
 
04:20:14.510 --> 04:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:16.269 --> 04:20:16.279 align:start position:0%
all right questions from committee
 
04:20:21.070 --> 04:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:26.870 --> 04:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:34.229 --> 04:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:37.510 --> 04:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
didn't representative berd thank you
 
04:20:40.590 --> 04:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
madam chairman um and maybe this would
 
04:20:42.870 --> 04:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
be better answered by deputy scandin if
 
04:20:45.189 --> 04:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
if the chair would allow it but uh I'll
 
04:20:47.070 --> 04:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
direct the question to the sponsor of
 
04:20:50.030 --> 04:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment first
 
04:20:52.750 --> 04:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for the amendment it it
 
04:20:54.630 --> 04:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
does correct the the major issues I had
 
04:20:58.389 --> 04:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
a concern with um however in the
 
04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
alternative couldn't the the clerks or
 
04:21:03.269 --> 04:21:03.279 align:start position:0%
shouldn't the clerks be able to send an
 
04:21:05.670 --> 04:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
actual copy of the filing papers to the
 
04:21:08.349 --> 04:21:08.359 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State rather than to create
 
04:21:11.710 --> 04:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
a summary of those documents uh I mean
 
04:21:13.950 --> 04:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
if we we made photo copies and scan them
 
04:21:16.469 --> 04:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
or or just fax them up to the Secretary
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
of State then he's got the entire
 
04:21:20.710 --> 04:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
documents in front of him which he can
 
04:21:23.429 --> 04:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
begin processing as opposed to just a a
 
04:21:25.790 --> 04:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
summary of name and address which which
 
04:21:28.550 --> 04:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
may be typed incorrectly and not have
 
04:21:29.790 --> 04:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
information that the Secretary of
 
04:21:32.030 --> 04:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
State's office needs to begin the actual
 
04:21:33.790 --> 04:21:33.800 align:start position:0%
processing of the
 
04:21:33.800 --> 04:21:35.870 align:start position:0%
processing of the
applications

04:21:35.870 --> 04:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
applications
 
04:21:39.870 --> 04:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
represent so we we considered this um
 
04:21:41.950 --> 04:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
and in the interest of passing the bill
 
04:21:43.990 --> 04:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to we want to give the
 
04:21:46.510 --> 04:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
bill the best chance to pass and you
 
04:21:48.030 --> 04:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
know different town Clarks operate
 
04:21:49.189 --> 04:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
differently they have different
 
04:21:52.710 --> 04:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
equipment represented ver on personally
 
04:21:54.389 --> 04:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
I I agree with you I I think that that
 
04:21:56.429 --> 04:21:56.439 align:start position:0%
would be the best way to go about it but
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know the situation in every town
 
04:22:00.429 --> 04:22:00.439 align:start position:0%
clerk's office and I think that this
 
04:22:03.790 --> 04:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
legislation Pro needs to go forward um
 
04:22:05.910 --> 04:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
and kind of I would love to work out I
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm saying I would love to
 
04:22:09.469 --> 04:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
work out those details next next session
 
04:22:11.910 --> 04:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
when this thing's already in place but I
 
04:22:18.109 --> 04:22:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:23.910 --> 04:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:27.670 --> 04:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
prus yes my concern is the daily I think
 
04:22:29.790 --> 04:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
daily is too much but perhaps it could
 
04:22:32.510 --> 04:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
be amended to
 
04:22:35.149 --> 04:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
weekly I think it's important there is a
 
04:22:37.149 --> 04:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
a Time Factor that's important in
 
04:22:40.590 --> 04:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
reporting these candidates so that's my
 
04:22:43.510 --> 04:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
take on it thank you representative did
 
04:22:45.229 --> 04:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
you want to respond as the proponent of
 
04:22:47.670 --> 04:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
the amend I I just I disagree with the
 
04:22:49.469 --> 04:22:49.479 align:start position:0%
representative I mean I believe we would
 
04:22:53.229 --> 04:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:56.950 --> 04:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
this anybody else um I I want to say
 
04:22:58.950 --> 04:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
that I didn't mention it at the public
 
04:23:00.790 --> 04:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
hearing but I think on that day or the
 
04:23:03.269 --> 04:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
previous day the post office had
 
04:23:05.990 --> 04:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
announced that we're about to get a rate
 
04:23:08.670 --> 04:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
increase and we can expect slower
 
04:23:11.710 --> 04:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
delivery in the future of US postal
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:18.429 --> 04:23:18.439 align:start position:0%
um and I think representative Barry's
 
04:23:21.590 --> 04:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
concerned that not every town clerk is
 
04:23:24.950 --> 04:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
going to be scanning these documents and
 
04:23:27.269 --> 04:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
sending them off I be doing it now right
 
04:23:29.189 --> 04:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that prohibits them from
 
04:23:32.189 --> 04:23:32.199 align:start position:0%
forwarding it by scanning the the
 
04:23:33.510 --> 04:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
document but I think the Secretary of
 
04:23:36.630 --> 04:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
State wants the original so that sort of
 
04:23:39.229 --> 04:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
mandates the mailing and we know the
 
04:23:43.309 --> 04:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
mailing is not very efficient so
 
04:23:45.590 --> 04:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
um I the only issue I see with this
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
amendment is that you're you're filling
 
04:23:50.670 --> 04:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
out a summary and that could be done in
 
04:23:52.710 --> 04:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
an email so I would think that would be
 
04:23:54.670 --> 04:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
pretty easy for most clerks to do that
 
04:23:57.469 --> 04:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
most clerks would have email the only
 
04:23:59.229 --> 04:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
thing I see is that then the Secretary
 
04:24:01.469 --> 04:24:01.479 align:start position:0%
of State if they reviewed the paperwork
 
04:24:03.389 --> 04:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
what that followed on the actual form
 
04:24:06.070 --> 04:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
and found out that the person wasn't
 
04:24:08.309 --> 04:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
qualified then they're going back sort
 
04:24:10.710 --> 04:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
of retroactively to pull somebody from
 
04:24:12.710 --> 04:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
the list
 
04:24:15.670 --> 04:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
but I don't know how often that actually
 
04:24:17.990 --> 04:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
happens and if that's a legitimate
 
04:24:19.990 --> 04:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
concern but I have real concerns going
 
04:24:22.750 --> 04:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
forward that as these original forms get
 
04:24:25.429 --> 04:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
nailed we're gonna really start to see
 
04:24:27.469 --> 04:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
delays I know I'm seeing it in mail
 
04:24:29.149 --> 04:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
right now in the state mailed within the
 
04:24:32.389 --> 04:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
state used to be overnight um I'm happy
 
04:24:34.030 --> 04:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
if it gets there in three
 
04:24:36.990 --> 04:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
days Deputy Stan do you have any comment
 
04:24:38.910 --> 04:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
on on my concern about a list as
 
04:24:42.469 --> 04:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
compared to the actual form for checking
 
04:24:45.149 --> 04:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair um you're
 
04:24:47.550 --> 04:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely right we we would want to
 
04:24:49.550 --> 04:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
have the original Declaration of
 
04:24:52.389 --> 04:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
candidacy forms in our possession during
 
04:24:54.149 --> 04:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
or as soon after the filing period
 
04:24:57.189 --> 04:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
closes as we can get them um I think
 
04:24:59.710 --> 04:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea to ask the clerks to
 
04:25:02.870 --> 04:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
send us who had filed uh electronically
 
04:25:05.950 --> 04:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
so that uh we have that information what
 
04:25:08.870 --> 04:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
it may mean though is that we keep uh
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
two lists on the website one is The
 
04:25:15.309 --> 04:25:15.319 align:start position:0%
Unofficial list of filings submitted To
 
04:25:18.429 --> 04:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
Us by the clerks electronically and then
 
04:25:20.229 --> 04:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
the other would be the official list of
 
04:25:22.750 --> 04:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
candidates who uh you know we have
 
04:25:25.269 --> 04:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
confirmed as qualified based on our
 
04:25:27.309 --> 04:25:27.319 align:start position:0%
quick review of The Declaration of
 
04:25:32.070 --> 04:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:36.429 --> 04:25:36.439 align:start position:0%
receive okay other questions on this
 
04:25:44.389 --> 04:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:47.910 --> 04:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
okay um I'm not seeing any so
 
04:25:52.790 --> 04:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
ask the r on a motion to amend House
 
04:25:57.870 --> 04:25:57.880 align:start position:0%

the bill
 
04:27:39.990 --> 04:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
sit amended is there a motion on the
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%

Representative no ma'am I don't feel
 
04:28:04.309 --> 04:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's necessary does anybody else wish to
 
04:28:06.269 --> 04:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
speak to the motion on the
 
04:28:09.590 --> 04:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
floor um yes Madam chair representative
 
04:28:11.990 --> 04:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
Cody I do think the amendment improved
 
04:28:13.590 --> 04:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
the bill but I think there are still
 
04:28:16.189 --> 04:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
some issues about the
 
04:28:20.710 --> 04:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
summary problem and so I will vote
 
04:28:24.389 --> 04:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
no thank you any other comments I will
 
04:28:26.469 --> 04:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
say it would appear that issues with the
 
04:28:26.479 --> 04:28:27.590 align:start position:0%
say it would appear that issues with the
current

04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:28:30.910 --> 04:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
practice um so I'm hoping that this bill
 
04:28:33.229 --> 04:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
at amended if it passes will get us a
 
04:28:35.389 --> 04:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
little closer to getting those problems
 
04:28:35.399 --> 04:28:36.630 align:start position:0%
little closer to getting those problems

yes and the chair votes yes and
 
04:30:20.550 --> 04:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative Cody if I could just see
 
04:30:22.670 --> 04:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
your face again for that
 
04:30:25.870 --> 04:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
vote for which vote for the vote you
 
04:30:29.670 --> 04:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
just made vote no on the otpa on
 
04:30:32.870 --> 04:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
77 I thought you did but
 
04:30:36.510 --> 04:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you all right and
 
04:30:38.750 --> 04:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
what's the vote okay so the count is 14
 
04:30:45.070 --> 04:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
to six so the motion carries 14 to six
 
04:30:50.109 --> 04:30:50.119 align:start position:0%
um this will not be in the consent
 
04:30:53.830 --> 04:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
calender nor will the previous bill um
 
04:30:55.910 --> 04:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
if somebody can let me know as to
 
04:30:57.910 --> 04:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
whether there'll be a Minority
 
04:31:01.389 --> 04:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
Report it's today Wednesday by tomorrow
 
04:31:03.670 --> 04:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon I was frankly hoping to have
 
04:31:04.950 --> 04:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
reports in
 
04:31:07.670 --> 04:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
today for what bills I suspect I could
 
04:31:12.030 --> 04:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
get the calendar opened but um
 
04:31:13.630 --> 04:31:13.640 align:start position:0%
suspected we could get bills that we
 
04:31:15.510 --> 04:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
voted on today in the calendar as long
 
04:31:17.149 --> 04:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
as we have reports in by the end of the
 
04:31:19.149 --> 04:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
day but I recognize that that's a little
 
04:31:22.910 --> 04:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
optimistic so um if you want to do a
 
04:31:25.670 --> 04:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
report please let me know and we'll try
 
04:31:28.109 --> 04:31:28.119 align:start position:0%
to get it in the calendar and if not for
 
04:31:30.030 --> 04:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
next week and if not we'll have to wait
 
04:31:32.429 --> 04:31:32.439 align:start position:0%
for a session in March my goal is to get
 
04:31:35.109 --> 04:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
it is to try and get some of these
 
04:31:36.870 --> 04:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
builds in the calendar for next week
 
04:31:38.710 --> 04:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
because I have a fear that our calendars
 
04:31:40.910 --> 04:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
are just going to grow ins size for
 
04:31:43.510 --> 04:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
voting as we go on for this
 
04:31:46.830 --> 04:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
session thank you the next bill before

absente ballot request list from the
 
04:32:28.910 --> 04:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
secretary of state currently only
 
04:32:30.910 --> 04:32:30.920 align:start position:0%
candidates can request and subscribe to
 
04:32:33.670 --> 04:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
the absente ballot list of requests and
 
04:32:35.469 --> 04:32:35.479 align:start position:0%
for the political parties to get access
 
04:32:38.269 --> 04:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
to that data a candidate has to note the
 
04:32:40.870 --> 04:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
party as the agent by allowing political
 
04:32:42.109 --> 04:32:42.119 align:start position:0%
parties to request their own
 
04:32:44.070 --> 04:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
subscriptions of the absente bot request
 
04:32:46.149 --> 04:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
list will ensure that the respective
 
04:32:47.990 --> 04:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
political parties can always have access
 
04:32:49.990 --> 04:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
to this data throughout the political
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
cycle in the case they don't have an
 
04:32:55.469 --> 04:32:55.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:59.550 --> 04:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
B I would urge the committee to vot
 
04:33:02.109 --> 04:33:02.119 align:start position:0%
pass are there any further comments from
 
04:33:05.670 --> 04:33:05.680 align:start position:0%

represent thank you is there a reason
 
04:33:20.690 --> 04:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
why it's only for Statewide ballot
 
04:33:20.700 --> 04:33:27.150 align:start position:0%
why it's only for Statewide ballot

[Music]
 
04:33:30.189 --> 04:33:30.199 align:start position:0%
UMES um So currently the the Statewide
 
04:33:31.709 --> 04:33:31.719 align:start position:0%
subscription the secretary of state
 
04:33:33.070 --> 04:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
offers is
 
04:33:36.429 --> 04:33:36.439 align:start position:0%
Statewide um all candidates with
 
04:33:38.709 --> 04:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
candidates down ballot within specific
 
04:33:41.109 --> 04:33:41.119 align:start position:0%
districts can go to their Town clerks
 
04:33:43.349 --> 04:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
that the clerks within their District to
 
04:33:45.590 --> 04:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
get the data um but currently the
 
04:33:47.230 --> 04:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
subscription allows for Statewide
 
04:33:49.830 --> 04:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
candidates to get the the subscription
 
04:33:51.230 --> 04:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
in the request list so this would just
 
04:33:54.949 --> 04:33:54.959 align:start position:0%
be extending that to local parties same
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
L thank

04:37:01.070 --> 04:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeny you can speak to
 
04:37:03.390 --> 04:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
your motion and can you please take us
 
04:37:06.670 --> 04:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
through the amendment because
 
04:37:09.470 --> 04:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
um absolutely so so this amendment
 
04:37:11.349 --> 04:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
actually came out of the public hearing
 
04:37:13.990 --> 04:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
that we had on the bill on Bill on House
 
04:37:17.629 --> 04:37:17.639 align:start position:0%
Bill 263 uh it restores the ability for
 
04:37:19.750 --> 04:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
candidates to file as candidates with
 
04:37:21.949 --> 04:37:21.959 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office I had
 
04:37:24.429 --> 04:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
originally removed that from the initial
 
04:37:27.109 --> 04:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
draft of the proposed legislation uh but
 
04:37:28.551 --> 04:37:28.561 align:start position:0%
after the public hearing and and
 
04:37:29.869 --> 04:37:29.879 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
04:37:33.070 --> 04:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
regarding it i s I thought it would be
 
04:37:34.551 --> 04:37:34.561 align:start position:0%
right to put that back into the
 
04:37:37.470 --> 04:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
legislation um and I also amended it to
 
04:37:39.990 --> 04:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
increase the threshold for reporting uh
 
04:37:42.310 --> 04:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
currently if a if a candidate committee
 
04:37:45.070 --> 04:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
or political committee spends more than
 
04:37:48.551 --> 04:37:48.561 align:start position:0%
$500 or raises more than $500 they
 
04:37:50.349 --> 04:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
report to the secretary state's office
 
04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
this updates that level uh to $1,500 in
 
04:37:56.470 --> 04:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
receipts or expenditures um and the
 
04:37:58.109 --> 04:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
inspiration with that was also from the
 
04:38:00.590 --> 04:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing and also in line with a
 
04:38:03.109 --> 04:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
bill from representative Edwards uh that
 
04:38:05.109 --> 04:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
we had already exec last week in which
 
04:38:07.510 --> 04:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
we're updating the reporting thresholds
 
04:38:10.670 --> 04:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
for individual donations uh this
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
proposal moves it up not at the same
 
04:38:16.429 --> 04:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
rate as we're changing the the $25 to
 
04:38:18.990 --> 04:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
$100 but just the $500 to
 
04:38:21.590 --> 04:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
$1,500 and I would say I I expect most
 
04:38:23.429 --> 04:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
campaigns running in competitive
 
04:38:26.429 --> 04:38:26.439 align:start position:0%
districts would spend more than $1,500
 
04:38:28.269 --> 04:38:28.279 align:start position:0%
in the election it's just been a
 
04:38:31.390 --> 04:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time since uh that
 
04:38:33.949 --> 04:38:33.959 align:start position:0%
threshold was put into law and it's just
 
04:38:36.590 --> 04:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
updating it to meet the current
 
04:38:39.510 --> 04:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
realities that we live in so that's
 
04:38:40.830 --> 04:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
that's the Crux of this amendment
 
04:38:43.310 --> 04:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
everything else bill is the same as it
 
04:38:48.470 --> 04:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:50.709 --> 04:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
introduced questions from committee
 
04:38:57.670 --> 04:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:57.680 --> 04:38:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

04:38:59.590 --> 04:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:39:02.709 --> 04:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
Peter um representative Sweeney just
 
04:39:07.789 --> 04:39:07.799 align:start position:0%
because I if I look at HB 263 and I look
 
04:39:14.070 --> 04:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:18.349 --> 04:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
um section one is gone right section one
 
04:39:20.629 --> 04:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
has been removed because that was the
 
04:39:22.750 --> 04:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
change to candidate and candidate
 
04:39:25.470 --> 04:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
committee so that is now no longer in
 
04:39:25.480 --> 04:39:26.150 align:start position:0%

the

04:39:26.150 --> 04:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:39:30.789 --> 04:39:30.799 align:start position:0%

04:39:41.430 --> 04:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
um so candidate is back in section five
 
04:39:44.510 --> 04:39:44.520 align:start position:0%

committee and so
 
04:40:08.390 --> 04:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
then uh in section five you get to the
 
04:40:11.310 --> 04:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
500 to the $1,500 limit that you would

talking about in regards to the other
 
04:40:20.590 --> 04:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
one so section four is new is new right
 
04:40:23.670 --> 04:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh so it's section five yep uh I don't
 
04:40:25.550 --> 04:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
believe it's new it's just changing the
 
04:40:27.708 --> 04:40:27.718 align:start position:0%
current section
 
04:40:29.990 --> 04:40:30.000 align:start position:0%

it's again changing the amount from 500
 
04:40:46.360 --> 04:40:47.150 align:start position:0%

to
 
04:40:49.910 --> 04:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
1500 and then
 
04:40:54.750 --> 04:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
section seven is the same as in the
 
04:40:54.760 --> 04:41:02.230 align:start position:0%

04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
elect um I actually have a question
 
04:47:08.948 --> 04:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
representative Barry that I the two
 
04:47:11.350 --> 04:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
things I show as just as being discuss
 
04:47:14.230 --> 04:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
with this bill I'm not sure that they
 
04:47:17.708 --> 04:47:17.718 align:start position:0%
impact the the vote but um we just had
 
04:47:19.310 --> 04:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
two amendments and I don't see one on
 
04:47:21.070 --> 04:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
this there was some discussion of copies
 
04:47:25.510 --> 04:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
versus data file um and I see that you
 
04:47:29.430 --> 04:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
have chosen not to change that there was
 
04:47:31.430 --> 04:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
also some discussion of P schedules
 
04:47:35.390 --> 04:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
which I be a whole different statute but
 
04:47:38.270 --> 04:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
why did you keep with the copies um I
 
04:47:40.150 --> 04:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
kep with the copies mam chairman because
 
04:47:42.270 --> 04:47:42.280 align:start position:0%
while I do actually believe a data file
 
04:47:45.628 --> 04:47:45.638 align:start position:0%
would be U easier on the cler they could
 
04:47:47.430 --> 04:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
provide the data file that would saice
 
04:47:50.190 --> 04:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
with this with the this legislation but
 
04:47:51.670 --> 04:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
I I think this legislation need to go
 
04:47:54.230 --> 04:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
into place and then as the clerks get
 
04:47:55.750 --> 04:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
used to it we can make it to where it
 
04:47:58.990 --> 04:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be perfectly um as to your
 
04:48:01.150 --> 04:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
other part about the fee structure I
 
04:48:03.230 --> 04:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
would also like to eventually see a
 
04:48:05.548 --> 04:48:05.558 align:start position:0%
scheduled fee structure put in but once
 
04:48:07.788 --> 04:48:07.798 align:start position:0%
again I don't want to overreach on the
 
04:48:11.910 --> 04:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:11.920 --> 04:48:12.628 align:start position:0%

04:50:42.948 --> 04:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
Madam chair uh this bill modifies the
 
04:50:44.510 --> 04:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
definition of political advocacy
 
04:50:46.708 --> 04:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
organizations for purposes of political
 
04:50:49.470 --> 04:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
expenditure contribution laws there are
 
04:50:51.910 --> 04:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
significant issues of organization and
 
04:50:53.830 --> 04:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
enforceability with this proposed
 
04:50:56.030 --> 04:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
legislation the types of free speech
 
04:50:58.350 --> 04:50:58.360 align:start position:0%
that would be covered is far too broad
 
04:51:00.708 --> 04:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
and the reduction from $5,000 in
 
04:51:02.670 --> 04:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
spending as the reporting threshold to
 
04:51:05.510 --> 04:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
$2,500 in spending that would be covered
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
by this legislation is a significant
 
04:51:09.910 --> 04:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
change that could hurt smaller advocacy
 
04:51:12.190 --> 04:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
groups uh frequently we have heard
 
04:51:13.948 --> 04:51:13.958 align:start position:0%
testimony in this committee from an
 
04:51:16.470 --> 04:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
unincorporated organization that refers
 
04:51:19.590 --> 04:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
to itself as the P Street Coalition that
 
04:51:21.070 --> 04:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
does not file with the Secretary of
 
04:51:22.868 --> 04:51:22.878 align:start position:0%
State's office regards the activity they
 
04:51:26.750 --> 04:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
do we should not punish unaffiliated and
 
04:51:29.670 --> 04:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
in small groups like The casri Coalition
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
that engage in activity that this bill
 
04:51:33.868 --> 04:51:33.878 align:start position:0%
would broadly pay his fcal advocacy when
 
04:51:35.708 --> 04:51:35.718 align:start position:0%
they are simply educating the voters
 
04:51:37.390 --> 04:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
utilizing the freedom of speech granted
 
04:51:38.910 --> 04:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
to them under the United States
 
04:51:41.270 --> 04:51:41.280 align:start position:0%

representative Barry appears to be
 
05:00:52.708 --> 05:00:52.718 align:start position:0%
confused about what Bill we're on or
 
05:00:54.948 --> 05:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
what he's
 
05:00:54.958 --> 05:00:58.190 align:start position:0%
what he's
doing

05:00:58.190 --> 05:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:00.868 --> 05:01:00.878 align:start position:0%

to speak to your
 
05:01:17.150 --> 05:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
motion yes Madam chairman um this is a
 
05:01:20.390 --> 05:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
complex issue the committee has reviewed
 
05:01:24.270 --> 05:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
it and still has questions and
 
05:01:24.280 --> 05:01:28.030 align:start position:0%
it and still has questions and
deserves

05:01:28.030 --> 05:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:31.110 --> 05:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
work there any further discussion on
 
05:01:33.990 --> 05:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
this my recollection is the Secretary of
 
05:01:36.390 --> 05:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
State during the testimony spoke about
 
05:01:39.110 --> 05:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
the the senson statute which was very
 
05:01:39.120 --> 05:01:40.628 align:start position:0%
the the senson statute which was very
confusing

05:01:40.628 --> 05:01:40.638 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
05:01:43.628 --> 05:01:43.638 align:start position:0%
that the bill really needed an
 
05:01:46.708 --> 05:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
amendment and
 
05:01:50.150 --> 05:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
when they were asked when I asked about
 
05:01:51.670 --> 05:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
their ability to work on the amendment
 
05:01:53.310 --> 05:01:53.320 align:start position:0%
do the things going on right now they
 
05:01:57.190 --> 05:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
were not able to work on it so um in
 
05:01:58.990 --> 05:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
deference to the Secretary of State's
 
05:02:00.628 --> 05:02:00.638 align:start position:0%
office who believes this needs to be
 
05:02:03.310 --> 05:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
changed but frankly the impact would not
 
05:02:07.070 --> 05:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
be till next year so there's no
 
05:02:11.670 --> 05:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
Farm waiting to get the formula langage
 
05:02:14.990 --> 05:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
right motion going support the motion to
 
05:02:17.310 --> 05:02:17.320 align:start position:0%
retain Madam chair could I just ask what
 
05:02:19.628 --> 05:02:19.638 align:start position:0%
sort of work is
 
05:02:23.310 --> 05:02:23.320 align:start position:0%
contemplated uty if you're on the line I
 
05:02:25.510 --> 05:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
will recognize you I think it's to come
 
05:02:27.270 --> 05:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
up with some formula other than the one
 
05:02:29.868 --> 05:02:29.878 align:start position:0%
that's in there because it's confusing
 
05:02:31.430 --> 05:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
and the point of it quite frankly I'm
 
05:02:33.510 --> 05:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
not really quite sure Deputy Stan do you
 
05:02:36.070 --> 05:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
have something to add to the and to help
 
05:02:38.350 --> 05:02:38.360 align:start position:0%
representative understand what we need
 
05:02:40.430 --> 05:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
to do with this
 
05:02:43.470 --> 05:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
yes Madam chair the the um the formula
 
05:02:47.590 --> 05:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
that we have to apply to come up with a
 
05:02:51.030 --> 05:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
standard that is as close to 1% as is
 
05:02:53.390 --> 05:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
practical but in no event greater than
 
05:02:56.350 --> 05:02:56.360 align:start position:0%
1% across the board for state
 
05:02:57.910 --> 05:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative candidates Senate
 
05:02:59.788 --> 05:02:59.798 align:start position:0%
candidates it gets easier as you get
 
05:03:03.430 --> 05:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
higher but it is uh it is a very complex
 
05:03:07.070 --> 05:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
formula that took a great deal of manh
 
05:03:10.230 --> 05:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
hours in the last decade uh to come up
 
05:03:12.990 --> 05:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
with if anybody in our office had to
 
05:03:15.310 --> 05:03:15.320 align:start position:0%
explain how the formula worked we could
 
05:03:17.948 --> 05:03:17.958 align:start position:0%
not uh there's one or two people that
 
05:03:21.150 --> 05:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
understand it and um you know ideally we
 
05:03:23.430 --> 05:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
would like to come up with a formula
 
05:03:27.110 --> 05:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
that that satisfies the intent uh and
 
05:03:30.590 --> 05:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
the uh uh well this just satisfies the
 
05:03:33.548 --> 05:03:33.558 align:start position:0%
attent the spirit of the statute but in
 
05:03:36.110 --> 05:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
a manner that we can tell candidates and
 
05:03:37.910 --> 05:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
voters that you know this is how we
 
05:03:41.788 --> 05:03:41.798 align:start position:0%
arrived at uh you know at at these uh
 
05:03:44.390 --> 05:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
columns and um that's what we're trying
 
05:03:44.400 --> 05:03:45.110 align:start position:0%
columns and um that's what we're trying
to

05:03:45.110 --> 05:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:03:47.350 --> 05:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
accomplish and would we would be happy
 
05:03:50.070 --> 05:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
to have any of you participate in coming
 
05:03:53.470 --> 05:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
up with that process that is so
 
05:03:59.628 --> 05:03:59.638 align:start position:0%

05:06:29.110 --> 05:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
reiterate when our next committee
 
05:06:31.310 --> 05:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
meeting I am not sure because that they
 
05:06:33.270 --> 05:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
have not assigned official dates for the
 
05:06:35.110 --> 05:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
first two weeks in March but I'm looking
 
05:06:37.910 --> 05:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
for three days Wednesday and Friday the
 
05:06:40.030 --> 05:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
first two weeks as soon as I have I will
 
05:06:42.150 --> 05:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
send them out and then I'll do the work
 
05:06:43.708 --> 05:06:43.718 align:start position:0%
of scheduling the bills but I'll let you
 
05:06:46.190 --> 05:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
know what days as soon as I have them
