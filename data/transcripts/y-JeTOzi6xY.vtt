00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.650 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.110 align:start position:0%
and
it gives

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
it gives
 
00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:12.500 align:start position:0%
us here yeah I appreciate that
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
okay so this this is this is okay all
 
00:17:16.439 --> 00:17:20.710 align:start position:0%
okay so this this is this is okay all
right

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh well it seems that we are missing
 
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:25.140 align:start position:0%
three people
 
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
am I getting that right
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly all right so at this point
 
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.610 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly all right so at this point
yeah

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
we we may need a sub but at this point
 
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
um let's let's hopefully we won't need
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
one right
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of
 
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on 613 raise your hand one
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
two three but you're not on one two
 
00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
three four
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
and five okay
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
if I just zip
 
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:15.890 align:start position:0%
if I just zip
okay

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:18.059 align:start position:0%
all right what's that oh here we go okay
 
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
so 303 is next
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
relative insurance coverage for Pain
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
Management Services okay 303 we have
 
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
already taken taken up retained seven
 
00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:31.100 align:start position:0%
zip so we're all set with that
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
next is four one four P fast coverages
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
okay so this one we have we were mailed
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
out the codes
 
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
and whether the codes work or not I
 
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
think is best for us to retain this bill
 
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
so we can find out whether these codes
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
are working or not and if there's not
 
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
then we'll have to revisit the issue
 
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:59.810 --> 00:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
okay I agree I just I just like to
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
comment that
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
um a um
 
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
an administrative health expert looked
 
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
at the codes and said they're absolutely
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
not comprehensive
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
not comprehensive not comprehensive
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
exactly there still could be some
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
there's something in there but it
 
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover everything that we needed
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
to cover so no obviously we don't have
 
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.029 align:start position:0%
to cover so no obviously we don't have
your

00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
consultant here with us today but I
 
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
could get them here pretty soon
 
00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:27.299 align:start position:0%
so the question I have is and I've
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
always wondered about that when it comes
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
to these codes is that
 
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.970 align:start position:0%
to these codes is that
um

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
if a physician
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
thinks getting tested is a good idea
 
00:19:45.049 --> 00:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
and and you're saying not comprehensive
 
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
but theoretically it's sort of a grab
 
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
bag they could choose any one of those
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
not necessarily like he gave me an
 
00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:54.299 align:start position:0%
example of if you have a heart condition
 
00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
that might have been precipitated by P
 
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
fast's contamination it would not be
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
covered is what he said interest so
 
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility that it could get
 
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
rejected yes okay so uh
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
I I know I it went many many moons ago I
 
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
passed external review
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
would someone if uh got a uh if a
 
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
physician put in a code and it wasn't
 
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
comprehensive or some would external
 
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
review kick in and would there be an
 
00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:33.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
do you mind coming up to the mic sorry
 
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
because we want to preserve what you
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
have to say forever and ever
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman hunt I think there
 
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
are a couple things that would come into
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
play here one the health condition would
 
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
be covered on its own whether it's pfas
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
related or not and secondarily if a code
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't entirely comprehensive there
 
00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
is an external review process there's
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
also a process to work with the
 
00:20:59.890 --> 00:20:59.900 align:start position:0%
providers and get your Priuses necessary
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh we have a team in our department that
 
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
if there's somebody who doesn't feel
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
like it's being approved appropriately
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
we can work them walk them through that
 
00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:09.059 align:start position:0%
process I know that you've had Keith
 
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
nyan's number here before but I think
 
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
the coverage already exists and as as
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
kind of medical appreciation for how to
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
best treat it changes
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
codes will change and the way they're
 
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
approved will change
 
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
um I don't think uh from the
 
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
Department's point of view there needs
 
00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
to be a change today we don't have a
 
00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:29.220 align:start position:0%
complaint that we're sitting on saying
 
00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:30.299 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to get somebody
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
 yeah go ahead
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
we had a um the person that submitted
 
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
the bill had an issue so that's why this
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
bill is here
 
00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not suggesting that nobody has had a
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
complaint I'm saying the insurance
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
department has never had a complaint I
 
00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
would encourage that person if somebody
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
thought they had an issue I would
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
encourage them to talk to our experts so
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
that we can interface with the insurance
 
00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:00.059 align:start position:0%
company and ensure that it's coverage
 
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
and the external review process is a
 
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
determination of medical necessity and
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's where it would happen and so
 
00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
there are teams internal and external to
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
the department that would help with
 
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.690 align:start position:0%
the department that would help with
those

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:10.700 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all right
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
I move and
 
00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
representative Burrough seconds to
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
retain House Bill 414 any discussion on
 
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
the motion
 
00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
all those in favor raise your hand
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
one two three four five
 
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:43.430 align:start position:0%
one two three four five
okay

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
three one nine establishing committee to
 
00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
study an all-pair system of insurance
 
00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
for Hospital services
 
00:22:59.570 --> 00:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
okay so theoretically we we passed this
 
00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.649 align:start position:0%
okay so theoretically we we passed this
one

00:23:00.649 --> 00:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
and then uh representative Terry did
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
tell me that he he looked into
 
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania law and they hadn't passed
 
00:23:09.649 --> 00:23:09.659 align:start position:0%
it the only state that actually did pay
 
00:23:12.529 --> 00:23:12.539 align:start position:0%
up as a pastor has it in place is
 
00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
Maryland and evidently Maryland has had
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
it in place for for years and years and
 
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
they have Revisited many times so
 
00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:21.539 align:start position:0%
basically it's just this the Maryland
 
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
statute excuse about Maryland
 
00:23:29.049 --> 00:23:29.059 align:start position:0%
um my consultant consultant my husband
 
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
if you're being a transparent said that
 
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
the Maryland all-payer system isn't
 
00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:36.659 align:start position:0%
isn't a bona fide all-pair system he
 
00:23:39.289 --> 00:23:39.299 align:start position:0%
said it's different so if um
 
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
representative Terry has his committee
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
this summer we could get more info on
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
that right so I guess I I thought all
 
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
pair was kind of a misleading what it's
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
what it sounded like to me in the
 
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
testimony was that
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
um the what the hospital would be
 
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
reimbursed was pre was determined not
 
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
through a contractual arrangement with
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
insurance companies as we do it now
 
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
we're the rest of us states do it is
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
instead it was predetermined by a state
 
00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:16.730 align:start position:0%
instead it was predetermined by a state
agency

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
I can't go deeper than that is that it
 
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
correct there was a state bureaucrat
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
what was it was it done through the
 
00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
Maryland insurance department or who was
 
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
the who was the one of determining the
 
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.169 --> 00:24:32.179 align:start position:0%
I'm looking I'm not looking at you Paula
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
good morning Paula Rogers and I'm here
 
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
on behalf of Anthem this morning and
 
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
there may be people in the audience that
 
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
know far more about this than I but in a
 
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
conversation I did have with the chair
 
00:24:57.649 --> 00:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
earlier we talked about Maryland in
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
general and my understanding is Maryland
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
had a unique situation that sort of came
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
forth in 1970 or thereabouts and it sort
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
of uh sort of got control of an
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
all-payer system with some sort of
 
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
commission-like body and it included
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement it included
 
00:25:18.289 --> 00:25:18.299 align:start position:0%
Medicare which is pretty unusual and the
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
private insurers and that system sort of
 
00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
went along very productively from
 
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
Maryland's point of view for a number of
 
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
decades I do believe something happened
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
four or five years ago whether they sort
 
00:25:30.289 --> 00:25:30.299 align:start position:0%
of converted it into a slightly
 
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
different model but the same concept it
 
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
was hospital-based services and this
 
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
uniformity around reimbursements that
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
came from all the payers for a
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
particular procedure and my
 
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
understanding is many people feel that
 
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
this has held rates down but it has not
 
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
addressed utilization so there's this
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
human nature sort of thing where if you
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
have a fixed rate and in the old days
 
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
you used to be able to negotiate that
 
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
rate on your own
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
um if the rate is fixed there's this
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
sort of pressure saying all right we
 
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
feel maybe this isn't enough how are we
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
going to address utilization and expand
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
that so there's sort of that perverse
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
concept that's in the background that
 
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
people don't address very directly so
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
that's if they've got if they if there
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
is this still in place then they must
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
have gotten a waiver a Medicare waiver
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
they they arranged with Medicare way
 
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
back in the 70s Medicare you guys are
 
00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:27.779 align:start position:0%
waiting so it was a unique situation
 
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
they were grandfather did right other
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
states have tried to put some sort of
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
modification in with
 
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
um sort of a percentage Tolerance on
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
rate increases carrier to carrier so
 
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
everybody struggles with this but and
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
it's a complex issue and each state of
 
00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
course has a different sort of geography
 
00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
to it as far as the payers that are in
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
the system which makes it complicated so
 
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
Sabrina Dunlop is here Maryland as far
 
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
as I remember is not in the commercial
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
Market except it's let's put it this way
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
it's not in the probably individual and
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
Exchange Market we have here it would be
 
00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
in the commercial Market okay so of our
 
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
other providers is ensure if any of them
 
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
actually in the Maryland Market
 
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
I mean I I'm thinking about if we're
 
00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
going to bring consultants and experts
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
Hoover it would be nice to have someone
 
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
in state who's actually right you
 
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you want to have somebody that
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
is has been in that Maryland system and
 
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
I'm sure Anthem has some exposure in
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
Maryland okay and I'm sure Cigna would
 
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
have some exposure in Maryland so you're
 
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
talking about the big National Carriers
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
okay all right now I have a card here
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
from Laura Cooley
 
00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:48.539 align:start position:0%

00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:54.299 align:start position:0%
be testifying okay but if you would want
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
to come in and uh say something or two
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%

00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:45.179 align:start position:0%
representative Terry you're not excited
 
00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
about uh researching this this uh what
 
00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:50.940 align:start position:0%
Marilyn does and see whether it be a
 
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
good thing to to do in New Hampshire you
 
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.029 align:start position:0%
good thing to to do in New Hampshire you
were

00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:28:57.289 --> 00:28:57.299 align:start position:0%
my mother always told me that I should
 
00:28:59.210 --> 00:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
answer a question the way that it was
 
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
put to me in which case Mr chairman I
 
00:29:06.409 --> 00:29:06.419 align:start position:0%
would have to say uh uh I am intrigued
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
by this however
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh since you threatened me
 
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
with uh the chairmanship of this uh this
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
study committee I decided that it would
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
be important for me to do some
 
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
additional research to see what I might
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
be getting myself into and when I did
 
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
that as the chairman knows from my
 
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
correspondence with him within the last
 
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
48 hours I found that there were more
 
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
questions that were being raised uh and
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
so um I I shifted my position as the
 
00:29:39.889 --> 00:29:39.899 align:start position:0%
chairman knows and now all of you will
 
00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
know from ought to pass to retain I
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
think it's an intriguing idea but it's a
 
00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
exceedingly complex subject and I think
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
that it's it would be premature in in my
 
00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
view to uh to take this step of setting
 
00:29:58.510 --> 00:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
up a study committee at this time
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
and and just a site is another example
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
um I believed in testimony that we heard
 
00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
that there were other states that had
 
00:30:09.769 --> 00:30:09.779 align:start position:0%
adopted such a system and one of the
 
00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
states that was cited was Pennsylvania
 
00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
so I did an extensive internet surge for
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
information uh with respect to the
 
00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
passage of such a system in Pennsylvania
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
and couldn't find anything
 
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
furthermore I couldn't find anything
 
00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
about an all-payer or single pay or
 
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
whatever system in in Pennsylvania
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
furthermore the the language of the of
 
00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:34.940 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
requires that the governor
 
00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:39.289 align:start position:0%
requires that the governor
appoint

00:30:39.289 --> 00:30:39.299 align:start position:0%
appoint
 
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
an expert
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
who resides in New Hampshire an expert
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
on the Maryland system and I thought it
 
00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
was rather curious that we're this far
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
along in the process of considering this
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
bill and we have absolutely no idea
 
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
whether such a person even exists
 
00:30:58.970 --> 00:30:58.980 align:start position:0%
so I I think that this this bill begs
 
00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
for a lot more work and that's why I
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
would move my position from otps I had
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
expressed earlier irrespective of the
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
threat of the chairperson I think on the
 
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
merits uh this this bill needs to be
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
retained and the threat still continues
 
00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
if we retain it I will still put you in
 
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
charge of the which case I will have to
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
think about this over lunch in which
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
case it would be too late so I uh so in
 
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
terms of retaining it we would just it
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
the difference from yes the bill as it's
 
00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
written which is not with anything it's
 
00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
got uh
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
one person from the Senate and three
 
00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
house members one oh just one one and
 
00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
one which I pointed out this is uh no no
 
00:31:42.769 --> 00:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
four members of the House
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
and one in the Senate four members of
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
the house so it's all sense of purposes
 
00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
it's it wouldn't be not much different
 
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
than retaining except it then has all
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
these other people who uh which shall be
 
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
solicited which can still be solicited
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
if we retained it so retaining is not a
 
00:32:00.529 --> 00:32:00.539 align:start position:0%
bad idea I think they have a lot more
 
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
work to do to satisfy me well it's this
 
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.330 align:start position:0%
work to do to satisfy me well it's this
bills

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:32:09.169 --> 00:32:09.179 align:start position:0%
vetting by this committee uh has not
 
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:13.340 align:start position:0%
reached a us a level at which I am
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
confident in being able to vote one way
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
or the other up or down
 
00:32:21.169 --> 00:32:21.179 align:start position:0%
um and so if I was pushed I would have
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:32:24.169 --> 00:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
um I would vote in expedient to
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
legislate between ITP and OTP because
 
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
itl and OTP uh because it can always
 
00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:33.059 align:start position:0%
come back in the future
 
00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
so the question for me is is it worthy
 
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:37.799 align:start position:0%
of work at this time
 
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
but by this committee or uh do we just
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
say no and ask the the the sponsors to
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh to do some more work on this before
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
they bring it back in a couple of years
 
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
all right so that that's the question
 
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
okay that's my conundrum yeah yeah I
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
guess I um given that the awkwardness of
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
the situation here where we actually
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
took action to pass it
 
00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:03.140 align:start position:0%
um I'd be more
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
inclined to know I'm going to be looking
 
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
at my leadership in order to leadership
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'd be more inclined to retain it and
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
then I will personally take charge of
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
finding someone who is an expert on
 
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
Maryland to come in and testify to the
 
00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.029 align:start position:0%
Maryland to come in and testify to the
committee

00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.140 align:start position:0%
and I'll say I'll I'll sounds like a
 
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
plan discharge you from that
 
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
responsibility thank you so because I'd
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
be interested to hear what they did I
 
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
appreciate being discharged rather than
 
00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.029 align:start position:0%
appreciate being discharged rather than
jettisoned

00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
jettisoned
 
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:42.299 align:start position:0%
yes thank you okay so are you are we
 
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
comfortable to revisit this and and then
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
retain it
 
00:33:46.799 --> 00:33:48.590 align:start position:0%
retain it
okay

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
um so I guess to to go through proper
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
parliamentary well uh um I moved to
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
reconsider our actions
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
um on uh the subcommittee's actions on
 
00:33:59.279 --> 00:34:00.889 align:start position:0%
um on uh the subcommittee's actions on
319

00:34:00.889 --> 00:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
319
 
00:34:03.649 --> 00:34:03.659 align:start position:0%
um and I asked urge everyone to vote Yes
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
so all those in favor of reconsidering
 
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
our action
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
um on 319 please raise your hand
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
one two three four
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
six okay and then I moved that we
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
retained this bill
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
all those a favor
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.930 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:34:37.930 --> 00:34:37.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
353 it sounds interesting Commerce
 
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:44.220 align:start position:0%
and we've already retained this okay
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's already been retained beautiful
 
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.810 align:start position:0%
it's already been retained beautiful
389

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that I I just had the wrong
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
list in front of me and I was
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
so busy trying to make the list of what
 
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:05.220 align:start position:0%
needed to be taking up and I
 
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
didn't pay attention to do my homework
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
okay so the next one is
 
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
389 we actually already voted to retain
 
00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.130 align:start position:0%
389 we actually already voted to retain
it

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
okay hb130 now that one I do have an
 
00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:33.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me what did we do with 353
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:39.470 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:48.050 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
right on this plug
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.630 align:start position:0%
yes okay
um

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
so we'll hold this off into while you go
 
00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.650 align:start position:0%
so we'll hold this off into while you go
okay

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:02.329 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:37:02.329 --> 00:37:02.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
so um just I'll briefly describe what
 
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
the situation is this was the the PBM
 
00:37:23.089 --> 00:37:23.099 align:start position:0%
uh study and um affordability I guess
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
it's technically a drug affordability
 
00:37:25.079 --> 00:37:27.470 align:start position:0%
it's technically a drug affordability
board

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
um now I'm not sure everybody heard
 
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
about that the um the rules committee
 
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:34.740 align:start position:0%
did you hear about what happened in
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
rules committee okay so yeah this I
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
guess it had I was I on were we on
 
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
vacation did this happen last week or I
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
guess it was just after we left but
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
anyways the rules committee
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
um got bogged down on
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
um the funding problem
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
because the way the bill was written it
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
was an assessment the fee assessment and
 
00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
um and they have just had
 
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
ruled that that was not not really a fee
 
00:38:08.569 --> 00:38:08.579 align:start position:0%
that was an inappropriate assessment
 
00:38:08.579 --> 00:38:10.250 align:start position:0%
that was an inappropriate assessment
system

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
um and so that the the right way to do
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
it is it needs to be paid for out of
 
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
General funds
 
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
the governor does have some money in it
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
in his budget I'm told
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's anybody here can
 
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
confirm or not confirm that for me but
 
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
so TJ okay so that so there is money in
 
00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
there so the question is we need to fix
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
the statute to a
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
um which I think it would is that in
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
House Bill two of you guys is that the
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
language maybe in the house bill too
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it
 
00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
so it theoretically so there was two
 
00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
parts one the one part was that and then
 
00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:47.220 align:start position:0%
the other part was the penalties
 
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
the the issue has penalties in it which
 
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
it was giving uh an inappropriate board
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
a kind of a penalty system so the
 
00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
amendment that I have is a is to turn it
 
00:39:02.089 --> 00:39:02.099 align:start position:0%
into a that it could be General the
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
money will come from General funds or
 
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
from contributions because clearly uh
 
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
new Futures and ARP there were people
 
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
who are interested in this study so you
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
know that that they might be able to
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
find some money to help the study and
 
00:39:18.109 --> 00:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
then B was just to remove the penalties
 
00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
so a wait till I had the amendment and
 
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
we'll take it up at that time I just
 
00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:23.220 align:start position:0%
want to say I'm I've been in contact
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
with the sponsors and they um
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
they're not comfortable with that
 
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
Amendment they would like to retain it
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
to review alternative funding sources
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
they're not completely comfortable with
 
00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
the idea of it coming from General funds
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
or at all possibly because they're
 
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
concerned that they'll you know how how
 
00:39:44.089 --> 00:39:44.099 align:start position:0%
long are they going to be funded
 
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
oh okay well I'll be the next two years
 
00:39:47.569 --> 00:39:47.579 align:start position:0%
to buy any of them okay they would like
 
00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
you know they would like to retain it so
 
00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
that they have time to really do some
 
00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
more work on the only concern with that
 
00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579 align:start position:0%
is that means
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay that one means that if there was
 
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
money in the budget and did get it would
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
have to be then be in the trailer house
 
00:40:04.609 --> 00:40:04.619 align:start position:0%
bill too
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
you really want to vote for Hospital too
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
um no I'd like to see your Amendment and
 
00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:14.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
perfect all right so we'll wait till we
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
get that we'll come back to that one
 
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.470 align:start position:0%
get that we'll come back to that one
okay

00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
at this moment we're gonna We're Not
 
00:40:25.609 --> 00:40:25.619 align:start position:0%
Gonna Take It Up until until we we have
 
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
this amendment and we can think about it
 
00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
but we we have just so everybody knows
 
00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
we we technically we do have an exact
 
00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
session this afternoon we don't have to
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
take up everything this afternoon and
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
then we have
 
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
um uh next week
 
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
and uh it can't be Tuesday because
 
00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
Tuesday is home meeting day so I would
 
00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:47.339 align:start position:0%
be doing everything on Wednesday so
 
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
anything that's left over from what we
 
00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
do uh this afternoon uh we would
 
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
schedule for a subcommittee in the
 
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
morning of Wednesday and then exec it
 
00:40:59.569 --> 00:40:59.579 align:start position:0%
Wednesday afternoon and and have to have
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
it done
 
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
because a I don't want to come back on
 
00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
Thursday but if we have to we would come
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
back on Thursday but we wouldn't want to
 
00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:08.579 align:start position:0%
get everything done next week but we'll
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
we're my my expectation is is we're
 
00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
going to try to get through everything
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
today in the afternoon in terms of
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
executing for but I know there's at
 
00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:24.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
so we're still that those are still have
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
to be uh addressed that we're gonna have
 
00:41:32.329 --> 00:41:32.339 align:start position:0%
to put that off till uh Wednesday next
 
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200 align:start position:0%

so do you wanna
 
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:39.780 align:start position:0%

John I have a question okay
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
okay actually yeah so we're here we're
 
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
still we're still waiting for
 
00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:56.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
oh wait a minute yeah 513 yeah the one
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:04.609 --> 00:44:04.619 align:start position:0%
okay all right so for the committee
 
00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:07.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
based on what we heard in the hearing
 
00:44:14.089 --> 00:44:14.099 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:44:17.329 --> 00:44:17.339 align:start position:0%
one set of people that can get the drug
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
get their uh medication they Infuse
 
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
medication at a clinic or a hospital and
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies will pay for it
 
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
but depending on their coverage
 
00:44:32.329 --> 00:44:32.339 align:start position:0%
they that we ask the insurance company
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
specifically do they have a problem with
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
the rate and they said no
 
00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
we were told that the rate was higher
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
and maybe as much as four times higher
 
00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
than what it would be if they had
 
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
the medication delivered to the patient
 
00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
and then the patient brought it in
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
that is referred to as brown bagging so
 
00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
I don't want to have to keep saying that
 
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
over and over again
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
the other class of people a group of
 
00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
people were people who are
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
receiving the medication at home
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
and they're bringing it to the clinic
 
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
they pay the insurance company pays a
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
we have a situation in the and and
 
00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
people have been doing this apparently
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
for years
 
00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
and thank you and the delivery of the
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
medication to the individual is often
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
the same delivery system as delivery I
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
mean by like mail I don't I don't mean
 
00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
injection the uh the supply delivery is
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
the same delivery as the people in the
 
00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
hospitals they're getting it through the
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
same delivery system
 
00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
so what we're seeing essentially is
 
00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
a medication that can be delivered two
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
different ways one of which is cheaper
 
00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
than the other
 
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
and that the insurance company is okay
 
00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
with either delivery now here's my
 
00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:58.910 align:start position:0%
with either delivery now here's my
question

00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
we have a about a 20 underinsurance rate
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
in this state that's about 20 percent of
 
00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
the people who are between uh 18 and 65
 
00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
that are hanging on by a thread with the
 
00:46:14.569 --> 00:46:14.579 align:start position:0%
amount of insurance that they get that
 
00:46:16.849 --> 00:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
they can afford to buy
 
00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
those people
 
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
if they are not allowed to Brown Bag
 
00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
their medication they won't get the
 
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:24.710 align:start position:0%
their medication they won't get the
medication

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
medication
 
00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
the people who can afford or have access
 
00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
to the insurance where the hospitals are
 
00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
getting more money
 
00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
is actually a help for the hospitals the
 
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:37.140 align:start position:0%
patient is getting what they want and
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
the hospitals are getting a small
 
00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
subsidy and we know that in New
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire especially up in the northern
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
part of the state our hospitals are
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
totally beleaguered we're losing
 
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
hospitals they're consolidating we're
 
00:46:50.569 --> 00:46:50.579 align:start position:0%
losing services
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
so the fact that this is an agreed to
 
00:46:56.089 --> 00:46:56.099 align:start position:0%
plan to help them out a little bit
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem that it hurts anybody so
 
00:47:00.589 --> 00:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
here's my question
 
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
who is benefiting from this bill
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
it isn't either of these two groups it
 
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
isn't the patience on either side who
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
benefits from this bill
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:47:13.609 --> 00:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
um what we have in front of you
 
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
is the amendment that representative
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
you've brought in with a little bit of a
 
00:47:22.329 --> 00:47:22.339 align:start position:0%
little bit of changes
 
00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:25.700 align:start position:0%
and um I would say the the biggest
 
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:29.060 align:start position:0%
benefit was actually in his original
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
language which is that the reimbursement
 
00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:34.980 align:start position:0%
rate will be at what the insurance
 
00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:38.220 align:start position:0%
company normally reimburses if it was
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
directly purchased through let's say a
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
pharmacist so that will save all rate
 
00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
payers all rate pairs just time me out
 
00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
will save all rate payers because now
 
00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies won't have to
 
00:47:55.609 --> 00:47:55.619 align:start position:0%
pay out as much to the hospitals so
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's in that's in that in Roman
 
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
numeral too Roman numeral three
 
00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
if you look at it and see how it's
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
written a patient may opt in
 
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
a program by which and is the health
 
00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:14.819 align:start position:0%
organ that's your brown bag right there
 
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
so basically to answer your question is
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
who will benefit from this
 
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
everybody is going to benefit by passing
 
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
this I'm sorry I'm not naive I do not
 
00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
believe that for a second but as long as
 
00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
they allow it to be opt in
 
00:48:32.569 --> 00:48:32.579 align:start position:0%
I can live with that good I can't I
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
don't ever believe that in my lifetime
 
00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm old and I'm older than you are I
 
00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
have never ever seen insurance rates go
 
00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
down not ever okay so
 
00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.210 align:start position:0%
down not ever okay so
um

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:46.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing that insurance rates would
 
00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:50.460 align:start position:0%
go down would would be a very dangerous
 
00:48:52.849 --> 00:48:52.859 align:start position:0%
premise for me or anybody to ever say
 
00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
that okay what I do know
 
00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
is that we have a a law
 
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh that was a part of the Affordable
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
Care Act
 
00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:04.740 align:start position:0%
and which is called the minimum loss
 
00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:05.750 align:start position:0%
and which is called the minimum loss
ratio

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
ratio
 
00:49:08.809 --> 00:49:08.819 align:start position:0%
and which basically says that a premium
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
is determined by how much the insurance
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
company pays out
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
okay and uh so therefore if the
 
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
than it will have an impact on that
 
00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:28.460 align:start position:0%
minimum loss ratio and not saying that
 
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding other factors
 
00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
other new pharmaceutical other new
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
cancer patient medicines that might come
 
00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
out but in this case at least we have
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
addressed that problem of that the
 
00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:47.420 align:start position:0%
hospitals were billing for these cancer
 
00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
medications at a rate that was four
 
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
times higher than what would be paid if
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
there was a brown bag option available
 
00:49:58.970 --> 00:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
so the hospitals themselves though are
 
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
still gonna I I can't read this thing
 
00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:02.540 align:start position:0%
fast enough I'm sorry
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
this amendment was actually was in the
 
00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
hearing was then where when we had the
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill
 
00:50:11.089 --> 00:50:11.099 align:start position:0%
everything you see in here in that case
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
I didn't see
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
you're right I did okay I understand
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:18.950 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
um

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
just to be sure
 
00:50:22.849 --> 00:50:22.859 align:start position:0%
um this amendment has been reviewed by
 
00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and the sponsor is okay with
 
00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:25.309 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and the sponsor is okay with
it

00:50:25.309 --> 00:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:50:25.319 --> 00:50:35.690 align:start position:0%
it
uh

00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay anybody other uh we're we're he's
 
00:50:40.609 --> 00:50:40.619 align:start position:0%
getting it we're getting it to him oh
 
00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:51.049 --> 00:50:51.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
 
00:50:55.609 --> 00:50:55.619 align:start position:0%
something was said that I I um take
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
umbrance with
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
um there are people with the ages of six
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
18 to 99 essentially who are able to
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
without insurance without any insurance
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
to go to a federally subsidized Clinic
 
00:51:10.849 --> 00:51:10.859 align:start position:0%
an hrsa and get medications they are
 
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
pharmacies within those clinics that
 
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
will reduce the price of those they are
 
00:51:17.089 --> 00:51:17.099 align:start position:0%
federally subsidized to be able to do so
 
00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
I've never seen anybody paying more than
 
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:22.380 align:start position:0%
a hundred and fifty dollars for a large
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
um for a large
 
00:51:29.569 --> 00:51:29.579 align:start position:0%
Specialty Pharmacy drug because of that
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay so there are places for them I
 
00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
would tell you that I am one last
 
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
provider in those clinics so and they
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
are leaving like like everywhere but
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:45.049 align:start position:0%
 
good

to speak to this work session on House
 
00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:31.859 align:start position:0%
Bill 513. we do have concerns with this
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
bill and the amendment when we came and
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
testified we had just been handed the
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
amendment so we didn't have a chance to
 
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
review we've had a chance to review and
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
we still have concerns and in fact we
 
00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill is not ready for
 
00:52:46.609 --> 00:52:46.619 align:start position:0%
prime time there are many complexities
 
00:52:50.809 --> 00:52:50.819 align:start position:0%
to this particular topic and in fact the
 
00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
sponsor had said that his bill addressed
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
both white bagging and brown bagging
 
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
when he testified on the bill and we
 
00:52:59.329 --> 00:52:59.339 align:start position:0%
don't believe that the bill covers white
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
bagging at all I think the language in
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
here is only Brown bagging the sponsor
 
00:53:05.809 --> 00:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
also said that his language moves the
 
00:53:05.819 --> 00:53:06.609 align:start position:0%
also said that his language moves the
practice

00:53:06.609 --> 00:53:06.619 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:09.380 align:start position:0%
of the payments to a pharmacy benefit
 
00:53:12.049 --> 00:53:12.059 align:start position:0%
again the language in this bill is not
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
clear at all that that is true
 
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
um so we believe that if it does go to a
 
00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacy benefit the people who will be
 
00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
impacted will be the patients themselves
 
00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
typically Pharmacy benefits have a lot
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
less coverage from medications and so
 
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
they have high deductibles and high
 
00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:34.140 align:start position:0%
co-pays so the person who's paying more
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
out of pocket will be the patient
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
um and then lastly it only amends the
 
00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:40.740 align:start position:0%
Managed Care statute there are other
 
00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
insurance statutes that are not
 
00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
contemplated in this bill so we think
 
00:53:46.849 --> 00:53:46.859 align:start position:0%
there could be some loopholes here with
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
the consideration of this particular
 
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.809 align:start position:0%
the consideration of this particular
topic

00:53:50.809 --> 00:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
topic
 
00:53:53.809 --> 00:53:53.819 align:start position:0%
um also for for clarification on um I
 
00:53:55.069 --> 00:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
think representative you had questions
 
00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
about Brown bagging web bagging and how
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
that actually works so both those
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
practices are insurance company required
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
practices so it comes from them
 
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who are going to be
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
benefiting financially because most of
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
the specialty pharmacies that they
 
00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:12.660 align:start position:0%
require to be used are their own
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
specialty pharmacies so they're paying
 
00:54:15.119 --> 00:54:16.210 align:start position:0%
specialty pharmacies so they're paying
themselves

00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:16.220 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
so that's where the money is coming from
 
00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure that that
 
00:54:23.089 --> 00:54:23.099 align:start position:0%
was clear to the committee and for all
 
00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
those reasons we believe that this bill
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
because of those complexities and not
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
having a full view of the particular
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
issues at hand that we believe this bill
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
should be itl'd or at a minimum retained
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm teaching by your concept that
 
00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
that if you move from the hospital
 
00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:45.800 align:start position:0%
benefit to the pharmaceutical benefit
 
00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:49.740 align:start position:0%
that there is a potential that the
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
patient would have to pay more out of
 
00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
pocket correct
 
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
and but then again that really is
 
00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
determined by whatever health insurance
 
00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
plan they happen to have right but
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
knowing how the insurance industry is
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
going most of the uh Pharmacy benefits
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
are pretty minimal for some of them and
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
um I think there should be a really uh
 
00:55:15.049 --> 00:55:15.059 align:start position:0%
in-depth review of Pharmacy benefits to
 
00:55:17.569 --> 00:55:17.579 align:start position:0%
ensure that the patient is not Health
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
harm you know harmed in this practice so
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
um would you agree with me that the the
 
00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
insurance department should be able to
 
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
evaluate that to like do a fiscal note
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
to see whether that be true yes okay
 
00:55:33.609 --> 00:55:33.619 align:start position:0%
could the insurance department do a
 
00:55:38.089 --> 00:55:38.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll take this amendment up
 
00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:43.559 align:start position:0%
next week thank you
 
00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:46.140 align:start position:0%
that agreeable to everybody
 
00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:51.470 align:start position:0%
that agreeable to everybody
okay

00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:53.220 align:start position:0%
uh as soon as we get it for you you're
 
00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:56.809 align:start position:0%
uh as soon as we get it for you you're
right

00:55:56.809 --> 00:55:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
Gene

00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
Gene
 
00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.030 align:start position:0%

uh okay 479.
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
okay this is another insurance
 
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
department and we all know amendments
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
this is a clean
 
00:56:20.329 --> 00:56:20.339 align:start position:0%
insurance department you're all set with
 
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
don't right so we're all set as it is
 
00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:36.829 align:start position:0%
don't right so we're all set as it is
there

00:56:36.829 --> 00:56:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:38.569 --> 00:56:38.579 align:start position:0%
oh so we have an amendment in front of
 
00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%

00:57:13.609 --> 00:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
uh this amendment which I guess was
 
00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:16.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:19.020 align:start position:0%

00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
excuse me this is the get rid of the
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
website today you're there yeah uh
 
00:57:35.809 --> 00:57:35.819 align:start position:0%
and it was handed out at the hearing and
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
the reason
 
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
okay could you just refresh my memory as
 
00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
to why
 
00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Heather Silverstein
 
00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
general counsel of the insurance
 
00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:58.490 align:start position:0%
general counsel of the insurance
department

00:57:58.490 --> 00:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:59.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment was brought forward after
 
00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
having discussion with industry and the
 
00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
this is the part of the bill that dealt
 
00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:09.500 align:start position:0%
with our Administration fund and we send
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
bills that basically fund our department
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
as part of the administration fund to
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
our licensees and uh the original Bill
 
00:58:18.359 --> 00:58:19.730 align:start position:0%
our licensees and uh the original Bill
had

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
um us either posting on the website as a
 
00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
way to provide notice for the billing or
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
by email to the email that the insurer
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
had provided the department after having
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
discussion with industry
 
00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
um we agreed that it's not fair to have
 
00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:37.140 align:start position:0%
a posting on the website and it's more
 
00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
direct and more fair to our licensees to
 
00:58:42.049 --> 00:58:42.059 align:start position:0%
have it just be the email notice and so
 
00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
that's all this amendment is pertaining
 
00:58:44.099 --> 00:58:46.130 align:start position:0%
that's all this amendment is pertaining
to

00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:46.140 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:49.849 --> 00:58:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
would you like
 
00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
we can have copies made okay so Mr
 
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
chairman now that I uh thank you for
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
refreshing my memory
 
00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:02.230 align:start position:0%
refreshing my memory
um

00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:05.220 align:start position:0%
it almost because I support this it
 
00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
almost becomes a mood point
 
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
to ask why it was there in the first
 
00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:12.299 align:start position:0%
place it seems inappropriate that it
 
00:59:13.609 --> 00:59:13.619 align:start position:0%
would have been on the website for the
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
whole world to see when it's actually a
 
00:59:18.349 --> 00:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
party that owes a certain amount of
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
money you're going to notify that person
 
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
personally through email so we're fine
 
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's good yes yes that's how
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
that's right to save time I'm not going
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
to even ask you why what the thinking
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
was in posting it on the website so
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
that's not a question thank you
 
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:40.130 align:start position:0%
thank you

okay
 
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
all right because we're all set thank
 
00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:45.650 align:start position:0%
all right because we're all set thank
you

00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
so we'll wait to take action on that
 
00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:55.990 align:start position:0%
so we'll wait to take action on that
well

00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%

pet insurance industry okay
 
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440 align:start position:0%

on this bill
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
and to make sure we have the right
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:30.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
so just another Community I I've been
 
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
trying to do some research on what
 
01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:37.740 align:start position:0%
happened last year and we and we're
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
scratching our heads we have no idea how
 
01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
this one slipped through the cracks how
 
01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
the mistake get done in the first place
 
01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
I can only imagine uh it's one of those
 
01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
Classics that
 
01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:50.470 align:start position:0%
Classics that
um

01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
communist communication with legislative
 
01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
services and
 
01:02:54.599 --> 01:02:56.349 align:start position:0%
services and
yeah

01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
much like
 
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
no it doesn't resolve it but just say
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
that's why in the first time why what
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
happened last year why why they replaced
 
01:03:08.089 --> 01:03:08.099 align:start position:0%
this language in the statute why they
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
didn't do a Roman numeral three back
 
01:03:10.079 --> 01:03:11.450 align:start position:0%
didn't do a Roman numeral three back
then

01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:14.339 align:start position:0%
um but at least we will get an
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity to fix it and it turns out
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
that the Manchester's
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh enforce the uh their what it was the
 
01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
health department actually follows the
 
01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
statute and that's really how we how the
 
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
state statute so ironically no it wasn't
 
01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
the actual sponsor having a problem but
 
01:03:37.849 --> 01:03:37.859 align:start position:0%
then he doesn't have anybody inspecting
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
he doesn't have a state expecting his
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
facility anyways but that it was ironic
 
01:03:45.049 --> 01:03:45.059 align:start position:0%
that a city a city discovered the
 
01:03:48.049 --> 01:03:48.059 align:start position:0%
mistake so but at least we get it fixed
 
01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
now all right so we have an amendment
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
number yeah
 
01:03:52.079 --> 01:03:53.630 align:start position:0%
number yeah
each

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
each
 
01:03:56.569 --> 01:03:56.579 align:start position:0%
okay seven
 
01:03:56.579 --> 01:03:58.370 align:start position:0%
okay seven
each

01:03:58.370 --> 01:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
each
 
01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:00.289 align:start position:0%
each
okay

01:04:00.289 --> 01:04:00.299 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
so I move and seconded by represent
 
01:04:04.849 --> 01:04:04.859 align:start position:0%
below no that's right you're not on the
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee right yeah can I just ask a
 
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
question yes um I just want to make sure
 
01:04:11.089 --> 01:04:11.099 align:start position:0%
the insurance uh department is okay with
 
01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
the amendment on this one
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of not jeopardizing the pet
 
01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:23.940 align:start position:0%
insurance piece of it
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
well I'll let you know about that after
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
you all vote
 
01:04:30.049 --> 01:04:30.059 align:start position:0%
if you all vote for it then I think
 
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
we're in pretty good shape but if
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
there's dissent
 
01:04:35.329 --> 01:04:35.339 align:start position:0%
um then obviously that makes me a little
 
01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
nervous but in all honesty I mean we
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
don't have a position but but I sat in
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
on your discussion
 
01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
uh yesterday and it seems to me as
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
though what you're doing is bringing
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
back a statute that seemed to perform
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
very well for a number of years
 
01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
so that wouldn't strike me as being
 
01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
necessarily controversial for anyone but
 
01:04:56.329 --> 01:04:56.339 align:start position:0%
that is my opinion as a former
 
01:04:58.250 --> 01:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
legislator and not necessarily with the
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
insurance department so I think I think
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.609 --> 01:05:07.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:11.809 --> 01:05:11.819 align:start position:0%
okay so uh all those in favor of the
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
amendment uh please raise your hands one
 
01:05:17.329 --> 01:05:17.339 align:start position:0%

01:05:24.599 --> 01:05:26.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
and uh the underlying Bill there was no
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
need to change that since it was model
 
01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
legislation right we're all set with
 
01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:35.700 align:start position:0%

01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:27.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.150 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
all right so 304
 
01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.349 align:start position:0%
all right so 304
um

01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
this was the uh
 
01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:38.450 align:start position:0%
proactively educating
 
01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:39.950 align:start position:0%
proactively educating
[Music]

01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
people is that what I would call this
 
01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
is though you can watch consumer
 
01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
protection but you know I was thinking
 
01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
somebody who uh I just happened to
 
01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
notice he has a truck that has the check
 
01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
engine light on
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
and I asked him I said well why haven't
 
01:07:02.569 --> 01:07:02.579 align:start position:0%
you had that fixed and he said well I
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
did and they said it was some one of
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
those electronic things and it would
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
cost him two thousand dollars to fix it
 
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
and that he didn't really
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
want to fix it for two thousand dollars
 
01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
so the question is notwithstanding your
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
bill which is that you're trying to
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
educate a consumer by rsas which I'm
 
01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
sure consumers I'm not really reading
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
our statutes that closely but that what
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
happens if someone really didn't
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
you know one of the cheap windshields he
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
was an old car one of the Jeep you would
 
01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:37.859 align:start position:0%
chill and knew that they were losing out
 
01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
on the backup feature or the or the you
 
01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
know the safety features that that that
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
glass had
 
01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
would shouldn't they be allowed to make
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
that decision on their own should they
 
01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yeah of course and
 
01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
you know for my four years on this
 
01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:02.700 align:start position:0%
committee that I don't believe in
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
legislating common sense in most cases
 
01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
so I completely agree with you they
 
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
should be and this bill allows for that
 
01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
but it also allows for a tiny bit of
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
Education like representative Spears
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
pointed out most people like I was had
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
no idea that they could be incurring a
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
pretty huge cost and a pretty dangerous
 
01:08:28.249 --> 01:08:28.259 align:start position:0%
situation with loss of their Collision
 
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
sensors and their radar sensors and all
 
01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
the other things
 
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:34.980 align:start position:0%
um after the public hearing I got
 
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
flooded with emails and I'm guessing
 
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
some of this committee did too
 
01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
because a number of different online
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
places picked up on this bill being in
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
front of this committee
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
glass bite and various Auto Collision
 
01:08:54.349 --> 01:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
Rags around the the country and said you
 
01:08:57.059 --> 01:08:57.069 align:start position:0%
know we're glad it's being addressed
 
01:08:57.069 --> 01:08:57.650 align:start position:0%
know we're glad it's being addressed
[Music]

01:08:57.650 --> 01:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:58.490 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
so I was surprised at how many other
 
01:09:01.739 --> 01:09:02.570 align:start position:0%
so I was surprised at how many other
um

01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
people and Industry places were were
 
01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
happy at reputable repair places were
 
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
happy that we were considering this
 
01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:13.259 align:start position:0%
little bit of notification and I mean
 
01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
you know my general political philosophy
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
that I don't go looking for problems to
 
01:09:19.849 --> 01:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
solve they're doing just fine or
 
01:09:19.859 --> 01:09:21.349 align:start position:0%
solve they're doing just fine or
unnecessary

01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
consumer protection or I mean I
 
01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:25.739 align:start position:0%
generally believe in you know buyer
 
01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:27.299 align:start position:0%
beware and do your research and things
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
like that because I do it myself
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
and this came as a complete surprise and
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
when I was approached about sponsoring
 
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
this legislation it wasn't front of mind
 
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
I was I didn't sponsor this legislation
 
01:09:41.209 --> 01:09:41.219 align:start position:0%
because I had a glass crack and I
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
thought oh we need a bill because of
 
01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:44.390 align:start position:0%
thought oh we need a bill because of
this

01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
somebody came to me and said
 
01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
there's an industry issue here and I
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
happen to have already experienced it
 
01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
and I thought
 
01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
wow this this really actually is a
 
01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
problem I didn't realize how big of a
 
01:09:57.650 --> 01:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
problem it was I did go through it
 
01:09:59.930 --> 01:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
myself so the two came together and
 
01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
that's how the legislation came
 
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
to the committee right and then even
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
more came out so
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
so that's the but a little bit when you
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
talk to your insurance company they did
 
01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
tell you by the way that make sure you
 
01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
get the right glass my particular
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
insurance company as I mentioned it
 
01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
happened to be Geico and I found out
 
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
later that some of the big ones like
 
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
Progressive said we require in order for
 
01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
you to be in Reverse by us that you use
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
the right kind of repair shop
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
so they did but plenty of people pay out
 
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
of pocket for something like a glass
 
01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.630 align:start position:0%
of pocket for something like a glass
repair

01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
repair
 
01:10:40.729 --> 01:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
and so they go looking around for the
 
01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
cheapest provider and some glass repairs
 
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
can be done very inexpensively as I'm
 
01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
sure you know it's it's a it can be
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
almost a commodity surface a service
 
01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
but these days there's what I discovered
 
01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
was there's a lot more to it I mean if
 
01:10:58.610 --> 01:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
you have an old clunker you have an
 
01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
older vehicle it doesn't have all those
 
01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
sensors it's not that big of a deal but
 
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
it's a safety it's just what I
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
discovered was it's a safety factor in
 
01:11:08.689 --> 01:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
cars after a certain year and I forgive
 
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
me I don't remember exactly what year
 
01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's fairly recent I'm sure
 
01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
and there's an expert here that probably
 
01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
could tell us or somebody may remember
 
01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
from testimony
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
so for me it was a it's a safety factor
 
01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
and you know I'm a 30-year paramedic and
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
I've seen an awful lot of bad window uh
 
01:11:29.689 --> 01:11:29.699 align:start position:0%
you know bad accidents and things so and
 
01:11:31.729 --> 01:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
we you know we're all at times in
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
attentive drivers and I've
 
01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
I've heard those alarms go off and I'm
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
pretty glad they're there pretty glad I
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
have those sensors probably won't buy a
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
car again that doesn't have them and
 
01:11:42.169 --> 01:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
I'll probably make sure my glass gets
 
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
calibrated if I get another window chip
 
01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
so don't think it's a bad Bill don't
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
think it's harming anybody I don't think
 
01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:51.140 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary regulation
 
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy if it saves one or two
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
lives if somebody gets their window
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
calibrated when otherwise they might not
 
01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:59.930 align:start position:0%
calibrated when otherwise they might not
have

01:11:59.930 --> 01:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
generally is designed to make the
 
01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
consumer whole with they've been harmed
 
01:12:15.169 --> 01:12:15.179 align:start position:0%
so the question is is there anyone out
 
01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
there illegally
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
putting it or it you know fraudulently
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
installing the wrong glass
 
01:12:29.209 --> 01:12:29.219 align:start position:0%
and then once a consumer finds out that
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
they had the wrong glass installed does
 
01:12:34.370 --> 01:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
not make the consumer whole by replacing
 
01:12:36.649 --> 01:12:36.659 align:start position:0%
it with the proper one no I I don't
 
01:12:38.090 --> 01:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
think there is to be honest with you I
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know I haven't done that
 
01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
research but I don't I don't think so I
 
01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
think what this bill does it just
 
01:12:45.649 --> 01:12:45.659 align:start position:0%
directs them I think they're going to
 
01:12:45.659 --> 01:12:46.669 align:start position:0%
directs them I think they're going to
get

01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
good glass installed and I think this
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
bill is designed my intent for the bill
 
01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
is that they would then get directed to
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
somebody with the proper calibration so
 
01:12:59.689 --> 01:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
you can have the mama pop or the or the
 
01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:02.460 align:start position:0%
less capable Glass Service install your
 
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
glass but then you're told you're told
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
ideally up front
 
01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
hey we'll do your glass but you have to
 
01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
go do part two or you should go do part
 
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
two you can neglect to do that you don't
 
01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
have you can ignore them and say I'm
 
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
fine with my sensors not working like
 
01:13:20.209 --> 01:13:20.219 align:start position:0%
you said that's your free choice take
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
the discount glass job save a few
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
pennies but understand that all your
 
01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
stuff doesn't work now
 
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:28.140 align:start position:0%
your heads up display is not going to
 
01:13:29.209 --> 01:13:29.219 align:start position:0%
work your inflation warning all the
 
01:13:30.169 --> 01:13:30.179 align:start position:0%
stuff's not going to work your lane
 
01:13:31.729 --> 01:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
keeping all that stuff
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
and save the money but what you what we
 
01:13:35.570 --> 01:13:35.580 align:start position:0%
just want to let you know that it's not
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
going to work so don't come back to us
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
because a we we can't fix it even if we
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to but at least here's a list of
 
01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
people it doesn't even matter yeah okay
 
01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
yeah so representative spear you I'd
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
like to yeah weigh in on this
 
01:13:54.169 --> 01:13:54.179 align:start position:0%
I I've looked into this as you know yeah
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of conversation and
 
01:13:59.149 --> 01:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
unbelievable research one other thing in
 
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
that way that I have one of the things I
 
01:14:03.649 --> 01:14:03.659 align:start position:0%
found was that new cars today don't come
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
with uh operators manuals anymore
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
they're built into their uh electronic
 
01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:10.140 align:start position:0%
systems you know you have to look them
 
01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
up on your little car dashboard
 
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
so my car being 13 years old I had one
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
so I saw what I had what had to be
 
01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.310 align:start position:0%
so I saw what I had what had to be
calibrated

01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
calibrated
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
but what I also found was that there's a
 
01:14:23.689 --> 01:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
whole lot of other things that can cause
 
01:14:25.490 --> 01:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
those cameras to get misaligned the
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
camera is built into the rear part of
 
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
the rear view mirror up at the top it's
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
not part of the glass as part of the
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
rear view mirror
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
if that gets jostled it's going to be
 
01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
out of sync right it's not going to see
 
01:14:38.689 --> 01:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
the little dots in the right place where
 
01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to see them
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
so replacing the glass certainly moves
 
01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
it around
 
01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:46.140 align:start position:0%
but so does a wheel alignment so does
 
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
hitting a curb
 
01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things so if we're
 
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
going to do this if we do this bill I
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
think it's got to be a little broader
 
01:14:55.850 --> 01:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be a laundry list
 
01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
of things that need to be there's a
 
01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
laundry list of things that can cause
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
this camera to get out of adjustment
 
01:15:02.689 --> 01:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
it's the glass certainly
 
01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
but it's not the only thing the
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation in a Ford
 
01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:11.580 align:start position:0%
the brand new Ford Mustang said that you
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
got to check it if even if you uh
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:18.239 --> 01:15:20.209 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:15:20.209 --> 01:15:20.219 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
while I think we should do something
 
01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:23.510 align:start position:0%
while I think we should do something
maybe

01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
I think it's got to be broader because
 
01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
it's not covering the whole issue and
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately people don't sit in their
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
cars and read their Little Manuals I
 
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
probably would but you know other people
 
01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:34.729 align:start position:0%
probably would but you know other people
wouldn't

01:15:34.729 --> 01:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
you like manuals so Mr Mr chairman some
 
01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
other states had much broader bills and
 
01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
they were difficult to implement and
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
difficult for the collision repair shops
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
to to deal with this is a simplified
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
version that just notifies the consumer
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
makes them aware of the issue and lets
 
01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
the consumer it's the New Hampshire way
 
01:15:57.250 --> 01:15:57.260 align:start position:0%
to implement this
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
I think right it's a it's a notification
 
01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
it makes consumer aware in your opinion
 
01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
in my in my in my opinion and I think
 
01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
it's shared by okay the spirit of the
 
01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
committee I don't have a problem with
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
limiting it but I just wanted
 
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
I'm less inclined to get too excited
 
01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:16.140 align:start position:0%
about this bill I mean it's just simply
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
it may not understanding that it now
 
01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
opens up this opportunity for everyone
 
01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
to come in and every little issue when
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
it comes to saying you know boy that I
 
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
someone who's been spent uh the consumer
 
01:16:35.570 --> 01:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
protection act you know have been on
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
this committee all these years and being
 
01:16:39.950 --> 01:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
part of the I have just I'm so wedded to
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
this you know what what the purpose of
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
this act it it seems it seems to be a
 
01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
little awkward to be adding this to the
 
01:16:49.130 --> 01:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
list but I don't see it as a slippery
 
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
slope I'm not really excited about it so
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to retain it so that we
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
could add more items to it or and you're
 
01:16:58.490 --> 01:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
saying no don't do that so yeah
 
01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:04.130 --> 01:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman you mentioned um
 
01:17:06.410 --> 01:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
under the consumer protection act which
 
01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
you're citing
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
um in reference to this yeah the
 
01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:12.060 align:start position:0%
requirements of this bill
 
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
um fraud
 
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering that the way things
 
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
stand now how there could possibly be
 
01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:21.770 align:start position:0%
stand now how there could possibly be
fraud

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
a consumer goes in and gets a windshield
 
01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:26.270 align:start position:0%
a consumer goes in and gets a windshield
replacement

01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
and the the repair shop puts in a
 
01:17:32.209 --> 01:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
different windshield the one that
 
01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:33.659 align:start position:0%
doesn't have all the bells and whistles
 
01:17:33.659 --> 01:17:34.910 align:start position:0%
doesn't have all the bells and whistles
right

01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
because that's what the the the the the
 
01:17:41.689 --> 01:17:41.699 align:start position:0%
owner of the vehicle was quoted
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
so how did that become fraudulent how is
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
how could that possibly
 
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
there is no fraud so the consumer
 
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
protection that covers fraud doesn't
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
apply here because there's no fraud
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
however if you have this Statute in
 
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
place and that were to happen then there
 
01:18:03.709 --> 01:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
would be a violation of law
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
correct so representative Cherry thanks
 
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
for bringing it up I'm not an attorney
 
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
nor do I work in the you know Consumer
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau but in my opinion
 
01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
separately as a consumer the only time
 
01:18:16.669 --> 01:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
that I would perceive it as fraud is if
 
01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:18.420 align:start position:0%
they told me you're going to have a
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
fully functional
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
windshield with all your sensors and I
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
for somehow somehow they made me believe
 
01:18:24.719 --> 01:18:25.850 align:start position:0%
for somehow somehow they made me believe
that

01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
you know and then I didn't
 
01:18:29.689 --> 01:18:29.699 align:start position:0%
but I think that's another reason to
 
01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
pass this bill because this prevents
 
01:18:35.209 --> 01:18:35.219 align:start position:0%
that this discloses that you're going to
 
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
get your car back with a working
 
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
windshield the way you had it when you
 
01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
brought it in and I think most
 
01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
reasonable consumers most prudent men
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
would think they were going to get their
 
01:18:45.169 --> 01:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
car back working the way they brought it
 
01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
in because most consumers don't realize
 
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
how sophisticated their windshields are
 
01:18:53.209 --> 01:18:53.219 align:start position:0%
these days that's the point that's the
 
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
way I was like here's what you're
 
01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:57.770 align:start position:0%
way I was like here's what you're
missing

01:18:57.770 --> 01:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
missing
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act would only
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
really kick in
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
is if the guy the the window repair guy
 
01:19:08.209 --> 01:19:08.219 align:start position:0%
the guy who put it in
 
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
who gave you misinformation
 
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
refuses to put the Right One In
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
other words the consumer protection is
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
to make you whole exactly myself so
 
01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
therefore if that if the and that to me
 
01:19:25.490 --> 01:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
is fraud and that's already in the
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
consumer protection Mr chairman that's
 
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
exactly my point we want to keep those
 
01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
little guys in New Hampshire in business
 
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
we want to make it so that they can
 
01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:33.530 align:start position:0%
we want to make it so that they can
repair

01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
repair
 
01:19:35.689 --> 01:19:35.699 align:start position:0%
and do their business in New Hampshire
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
on these sophisticated Windows because
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
right now it's difficult for them to
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
compete right we want to we want to make
 
01:19:44.209 --> 01:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
it so they can compete with the big guys
 
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
they can still do the do the glass
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
without having Grandma and Grandpa come
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
back and say hey
 
01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
you ruin my windshield and now you can't
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
fix it because they don't have the
 
01:19:57.890 --> 01:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
capability of doing it so so then they
 
01:19:59.209 --> 01:19:59.219 align:start position:0%
have to just give you your money back
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
correct as long as you give you your
 
01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
money back in your own set do you want
 
01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
to put the mom and pop glass shops in
 
01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
that position of giving the money back I
 
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
would hope the Mom and Pop Shop did
 
01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
don't uh you have not convinced me that
 
01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
Mom and Pop shops actually do that I
 
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
don't I have not been convinced that
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
there's actually a problem here yet
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better if they just told
 
01:20:21.290 --> 01:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
the consumer up front we can do your
 
01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
glass but we can't do your calibration
 
01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that just be a simpler solution
 
01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:26.699 align:start position:0%
I I hear where you're coming from so
 
01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:29.570 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
okay

01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know how the other
 
01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
committee members feel but I I I don't
 
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
want to pass this bill
 
01:20:37.729 --> 01:20:37.739 align:start position:0%
so I mean I'll retain it if if you want
 
01:20:40.130 --> 01:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
to continue the conversation but
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
otherwise I would just assume I would
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
make one comment
 
01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
not that I'm allowed to vote but you
 
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
know what the heck
 
01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
uh the problem is really the car
 
01:20:52.610 --> 01:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
manufacturers themselves in reality we
 
01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
can't do anything about them but that is
 
01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
where the problem is I I hear you so
 
01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs what do you think
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh you'll be next here well I think that
 
01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
this is a small problem perhaps and
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
there are bigger problems out there but
 
01:21:10.970 --> 01:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
we bypassing this bill it sounds to me
 
01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
that we would do something to help with
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
the small problem and therefore being a
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
member of the subcommittee I move out to
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
pass okay well let's we're right now
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to do a straw conversation
 
01:21:26.209 --> 01:21:26.219 align:start position:0%
okay okay representative Terry
 
01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
so on the question of misrepresentation
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
I I just need to help on thinking this
 
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
through so a so a a car owner goes to a
 
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
one shop and and gets gets a an estimate
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
of fifteen hundred dollars because it
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
includes all the bells and whistles this
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
is hypothetical then goes to a second
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
shop and the second shop says well
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
when we do develop this estimate it
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be the windshield that is the
 
01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
original replacement has all the bells
 
01:21:56.689 --> 01:21:56.699 align:start position:0%
and whistles that's you know fourteen
 
01:21:58.669 --> 01:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty dollars all right then
 
01:22:01.610 --> 01:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
then uh the the cons the consumer the
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
owner of the vehicle goes to a third
 
01:22:05.810 --> 01:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
shop and the third shop says
 
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
um we can do this for
 
01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
um a thousand dollars
 
01:22:12.770 --> 01:22:12.780 align:start position:0%
now the third shop
 
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
that the third shop is not going to
 
01:22:17.209 --> 01:22:17.219 align:start position:0%
provide the windshield that has all the
 
01:22:18.530 --> 01:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
bells and whistles but just a plain
 
01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
windshield right
 
01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
now the consumer doesn't ask any
 
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
questions looks at the three estimates
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
and says okay I'm going to go with one
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
for a thousand right I don't understand
 
01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
how that becomes misrepresentation
 
01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:32.450 align:start position:0%
how that becomes misrepresentation
because

01:22:32.450 --> 01:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
there was no requirement
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
that the owner of that shop provide an
 
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
estimate that in that that supplied
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
original equipment shall we say
 
01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:47.450 align:start position:0%
original equipment shall we say
um

01:22:47.450 --> 01:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:50.209 --> 01:22:50.219 align:start position:0%
windshield as a replacement
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
correct okay so so that happens now so
 
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's Point number one point number two
 
01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
is in the form of a question I'm trying
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
to remember anybody that was against
 
01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:01.850 align:start position:0%
to remember anybody that was against
this

01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh it seemed like even the everybody
 
01:23:07.729 --> 01:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
that testified said
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
um we're fine with this we think this is
 
01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
a good idea
 
01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
so whenever I'm considering a piece of
 
01:23:16.010 --> 01:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm wondering who's for it
 
01:23:19.010 --> 01:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
and who's against it and right now other
 
01:23:23.209 --> 01:23:23.219 align:start position:0%
than a philosophical if if I if I if I
 
01:23:23.219 --> 01:23:24.310 align:start position:0%
than a philosophical if if I if I if I
may

01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
characterize the the concern about this
 
01:23:29.689 --> 01:23:29.699 align:start position:0%
this bill other than a philosophical
 
01:23:33.169 --> 01:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
concern about not wanting to have yet
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
another statute on the books
 
01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm not really hearing any
 
01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:39.830 align:start position:0%
um I'm not really hearing any
substantive

01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
substantive
 
01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.450 align:start position:0%
substantive
opposition

01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
01:23:45.970 --> 01:23:45.980 align:start position:0%
to the bill by any party concerned
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
what am I missing here except me
 
01:23:50.810 --> 01:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
well I want to I don't want to
 
01:23:52.729 --> 01:23:52.739 align:start position:0%
personalize this yeah well yeah well I
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
think it's philosophical I'm
 
01:23:55.970 --> 01:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
philosophically opposed to doctor I'm
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
philosophically opposed to this bill
 
01:23:59.209 --> 01:23:59.219 align:start position:0%
because I think it's prophylactic and
 
01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
it's totally unnecessary and yes all the
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
people who want it are all auto glass
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
people who are doing it anyways so so I
 
01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
mean the only time we pass legislations
 
01:24:09.649 --> 01:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
we're trying to solve a problem that's
 
01:24:11.570 --> 01:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
real that's not happening but we don't
 
01:24:13.729 --> 01:24:13.739 align:start position:0%
we don't have any evidence that anybody
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
had the wrong windshield involved so if
 
01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
if you if you had four children and all
 
01:24:19.729 --> 01:24:19.739 align:start position:0%
four came to you and asked you for the
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
same thing and you said I don't believe
 
01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
this is necessary
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
how do you think your four children
 
01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
would feel I so we got we have a
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
constituency out there that says we
 
01:24:32.810 --> 01:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
would like this and we're saying no
 
01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
because we're philosophically opposed to
 
01:24:37.370 --> 01:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
this uh so I've made up my mind I'm just
 
01:24:39.169 --> 01:24:39.179 align:start position:0%
kind of give you an example I'll give
 
01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
you an example what about your children
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
example I'll give you is that
 
01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:48.410 align:start position:0%
example I'll give you is that
um

01:24:48.410 --> 01:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
this committee has in the past years
 
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
have had legislation to license
 
01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:57.470 align:start position:0%
have had legislation to license
home

01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:59.570 align:start position:0%
home
Construction

01:24:59.570 --> 01:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
Construction
 
01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:01.490 align:start position:0%
Construction
contractors

01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
01:25:05.330 --> 01:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
and yes it's amazing how many
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
contractors come in and say that's a
 
01:25:09.530 --> 01:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
great idea to license us
 
01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and yet this committee's never
 
01:25:13.970 --> 01:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
passed it
 
01:25:16.490 --> 01:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
and why
 
01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
because we know that it's going to mean
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day means that you
 
01:25:25.729 --> 01:25:25.739 align:start position:0%
have limited the number of people who
 
01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
are contractors you have now take and
 
01:25:32.630 --> 01:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
you have no way to have the State
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
Licensing Bureau to ensure that the
 
01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
contractor is actually competent
 
01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
other than you've given them a license
 
01:25:41.930 --> 01:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
and then you have John Hunt's rule of
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
licensure is the only reason we give you
 
01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
a license and so we can take it away
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
when you've done something bad so I I
 
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
suggest the potential flaw in the
 
01:25:53.810 --> 01:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
illustration that you've given us
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
might be that with respect to the
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
contractors you have a lot of mom and
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
pop type handy men and women
 
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
out there who do these sorts of things
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
and so if you were to require a license
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
in order for anybody to do any of this
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
you you certainly would be foreclosing
 
01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
the the possibility that many would even
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
enter into the field of a handy person
 
01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
all right okay that's so so it would be
 
01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
uh prohibitive the legislation would
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
effect be prohibited and I am all I'm
 
01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
saying is that I'm unaware uh I need to
 
01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
be made aware of of repair shops that
 
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
that do glass replacement
 
01:26:39.649 --> 01:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
that would effectively be uh driven out
 
01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
of business if what everybody else is
 
01:26:46.490 --> 01:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
asking for uh were to be placed in
 
01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
statute if we were to try to pass
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
legislation for every time there's a
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
possibility that somebody could get the
 
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
wrong item
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
that statutes would we go forever I mean
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
it just it's innumerable let's just
 
01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
stick to the problems that we have to
 
01:27:07.129 --> 01:27:07.139 align:start position:0%
fix rather that's not create
 
01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
I mean and it'll have unintended
 
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
consequences and I I just I don't feel
 
01:27:12.649 --> 01:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
the compelling need for it I really
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
don't so in your view those who came and
 
01:27:20.410 --> 01:27:20.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:22.149 align:start position:0%
 
already

01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
a possible motive of these individuals
 
01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
is to preempt others from entering uh or
 
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
participating in the market I think
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
they're only here because he put the
 
01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
bill in if the bill hadn't come in if he
 
01:27:37.729 --> 01:27:37.739 align:start position:0%
had introduced the bill they they we
 
01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
never would have heard about this
 
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
they they would not put the bill in they
 
01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
don't they I mean if theoretically if
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
they saw this being a big problem and
 
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
they hire a big time lobbyist he would
 
01:27:56.450 --> 01:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
be running in here with this bill and
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
saying yeah this problem is huge you got
 
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
to take care of it but that's not what
 
01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
happened you know he put the bill in and
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
and uh and so they all say well yeah we
 
01:28:08.050 --> 01:28:08.060 align:start position:0%
agree yeah that's a good idea pass that
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
no I just don't pass things do we have
 
01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:12.780 align:start position:0%
any idea if there are I could be the
 
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
minority I could be the only person in
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
no no I just wonder are you aware of any
 
01:28:22.129 --> 01:28:22.139 align:start position:0%
deleterious consequences or unintended
 
01:28:27.709 --> 01:28:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.719 --> 01:28:29.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
so you're inclined to pass it is that of
 
01:28:33.770 --> 01:28:33.780 align:start position:0%
my hearing
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
are you inclined to pass it or are you
 
01:28:38.090 --> 01:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
inclined to maybe listen to well I don't
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
want to have to be put on this on the
 
01:28:41.209 --> 01:28:41.219 align:start position:0%
commission uh we're doing a small pool
 
01:28:41.219 --> 01:28:42.129 align:start position:0%
commission uh we're doing a small pool
now

01:28:42.129 --> 01:28:42.139 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
so I I just representative see this is
 
01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:55.990 align:start position:0%
so I I just representative see this is
harmless

01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:14.689 --> 01:29:14.699 align:start position:0%
vehicle and and that dealer walked me
 
01:29:17.090 --> 01:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
through everything
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
on my car because he said there's
 
01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:29.689 --> 01:29:29.699 align:start position:0%
not always so you're inclined that we
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
don't really need this legislation I
 
01:29:43.970 --> 01:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:45.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:47.290 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:29:47.290 --> 01:29:47.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:53.950 --> 01:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:55.729 --> 01:29:55.739 align:start position:0%
do you have something more you want to
 
01:29:58.129 --> 01:29:58.139 align:start position:0%
offer representative Gibbs I I did um uh
 
01:30:00.649 --> 01:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
I do in in reference to dealers walking
 
01:30:02.450 --> 01:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
people through it I'd like to go back to
 
01:30:04.189 --> 01:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
the point that I made earlier in the
 
01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
hearing and that is that
 
01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
um I recently found out that people are
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
now buying cars online and they don't
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a dealer to walk them
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
through it just as they may not any
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
longer have uh a manual for their new
 
01:30:22.970 --> 01:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
car so some people may find out and
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
other people may not
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay so irrespective of the question of
 
01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:28.310 align:start position:0%
okay so irrespective of the question of
fraud

01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
which is a which is a a technical
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
question and a legal question
 
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
um are we aware of anybody who is
 
01:30:39.649 --> 01:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
unhappy with the current state of
 
01:30:43.010 --> 01:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
affairs because they were harmed as a
 
01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:43.750 align:start position:0%
affairs because they were harmed as a
result

01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
result
 
01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
of the wrong glasses installed in their
 
01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:48.370 align:start position:0%
of the wrong glasses installed in their
vehicle

01:30:48.370 --> 01:30:48.380 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna so if we're gonna enact a
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
statute more often than not we do so
 
01:30:57.050 --> 01:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
because there's a problem
 
01:30:59.209 --> 01:30:59.219 align:start position:0%
so in the final analysis here we have
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
you're correct when you use the term
 
01:31:04.430 --> 01:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
prophylactic because but nobody has been
 
01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
harmed nobody has complained absolutely
 
01:31:08.990 --> 01:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
nobody has complained so we'd be making
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
a law
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
for a situation that doesn't even exist
 
01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
we don't have to remediate we don't have
 
01:31:18.530 --> 01:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
to remediate anything correct because
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to remediate
 
01:31:24.649 --> 01:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
that am I you following me yes yes I'm
 
01:31:26.209 --> 01:31:26.219 align:start position:0%
looking for a box I'm looking for a
 
01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's great that everybody already had
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
this but for the benefit of those who
 
01:31:37.970 --> 01:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
may be a little slower that's fine we
 
01:31:40.750 --> 01:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:43.030 align:start position:0%
 
sooner

01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
sooner
 
01:31:47.330 --> 01:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
you know my my in-laws are stuffers and
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
I'm a verbal processor so for the
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
benefit of any who are verbal processor
 
01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
it's all been laid out there for you
 
01:31:55.870 --> 01:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:31:58.490 --> 01:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
somebody who doesn't Express themselves
 
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
verbally didn't yes didn't somebody come
 
01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
to the sponsor and say this is a problem
 
01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:07.090 align:start position:0%
to the sponsor and say this is a problem
no

01:32:07.090 --> 01:32:07.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
this was something that happened to him
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
he had the phone call he was told on the
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
phone by no I I understood that part but
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
he also said that that wasn't and is he
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
still here evidently he left the room ah
 
01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
well okay uh then maybe maybe I missed
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
one of us misunderstood him because what
 
01:32:30.050 --> 01:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
I heard him say was this happened to me
 
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
but that wasn't why I brought the bill I
 
01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
brought the bill because somebody else
 
01:32:37.310 --> 01:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
came to me and told me about this
 
01:32:39.649 --> 01:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
problem and I don't remember him saying
 
01:32:39.659 --> 01:32:41.090 align:start position:0%
problem and I don't remember him saying
that

01:32:41.090 --> 01:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:43.490 --> 01:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
what he said was that this happened to
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
me and it could happen to somebody I
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
kept hearing they could but but I could
 
01:32:51.490 --> 01:32:51.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:54.410 --> 01:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
none of this even matters because just
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
put passing this bill doesn't fix the
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
problem even if you did pass the bill it
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't fix the problem okay because
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
there are so many other there's so many
 
01:33:05.930 --> 01:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
things I could not that can't get out
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%

01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
three four
 
01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:13.570 align:start position:0%
three four
okay

01:34:13.570 --> 01:34:13.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.970 --> 01:34:18.980 align:start position:0%
all right okay so uh that takes care of
 
01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
everything and
 
01:34:24.530 --> 01:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
um now looking at the room I'm seeing a
 
01:34:26.209 --> 01:34:26.219 align:start position:0%
lot of people here I think are all still
 
01:34:30.169 --> 01:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
here for 1 30. so or yeah 1 30. so just
 
01:34:33.290 --> 01:34:33.300 align:start position:0%
so you all know at this point 130 it
 
01:34:36.649 --> 01:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
will be on the calendar next Wednesday
 
01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
morning for a subcommittee and uh
 
01:34:42.169 --> 01:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
potentially exact
 
01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
Wednesday afternoon and at that time
 
01:34:46.850 --> 01:34:46.860 align:start position:0%
Wednesday morning the insurance
 
01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:49.860 align:start position:0%
department will tell us if there is a
 
01:34:52.970 --> 01:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
dramatic if there's a fiscal impact to
 
01:34:56.209 --> 01:34:56.219 align:start position:0%
patients with the amendment as we now
 
01:34:56.219 --> 01:35:05.689 align:start position:0%
patients with the amendment as we now
have

01:35:05.689 --> 01:35:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:10.370 --> 01:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
um I just assumed put it off for a week
 
01:35:13.850 --> 01:35:13.860 align:start position:0%
you know I I want I I appreciate your
 
01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
your diligence on that
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
factor but
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
um at this point I think it's fine to to
 
01:35:23.629 --> 01:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
put it off the next week
 
01:35:27.010 --> 01:35:27.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
172 we we're retaining that
 
01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
we've already retained that one that's
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
the one that was the one that repeals
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
the whole thing
 
01:35:35.159 --> 01:35:36.770 align:start position:0%
the whole thing
right

01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:36.780 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:38.360 align:start position:0%
that was the one that's going to repeal
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
repeal the drug afford it and we we
 
01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.129 --> 01:35:49.139 align:start position:0%
and you do have the amendment now Okay
 
01:35:49.139 --> 01:35:50.090 align:start position:0%
and you do have the amendment now Okay
so

01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:51.649 --> 01:35:51.659 align:start position:0%
certainly well the most important person
 
01:35:53.209 --> 01:35:53.219 align:start position:0%
is the insurance department because they
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:03.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
all right so we're we're all done until
 
03:23:23.389 --> 03:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:23.399 --> 03:23:27.469 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:23:27.469 --> 03:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:27.479 --> 03:23:33.050 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:23:33.050 --> 03:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:35.750 --> 03:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
so uh I guess
 
03:23:41.389 --> 03:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
uh first we we have some uh guests today
 
03:23:44.269 --> 03:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
active retirement Association and
 
03:23:45.950 --> 03:23:45.960 align:start position:0%

03:23:49.309 --> 03:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:23:49.319 --> 03:23:55.729 align:start position:0%
education
welcome

03:23:55.729 --> 03:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:58.010 --> 03:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
um this is actually a fun committee to
 
03:23:58.020 --> 03:23:59.450 align:start position:0%
um this is actually a fun committee to
be

03:23:59.450 --> 03:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:23:59.460 --> 03:24:01.070 align:start position:0%
be
yeah

03:24:01.070 --> 03:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:24:03.650 --> 03:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
because uh we usually get along pretty
 
03:24:06.650 --> 03:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
well our unbiased opinion and uh
 
03:24:09.410 --> 03:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
and I I said uh I've been my name is
 
03:24:10.910 --> 03:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
John Hunt I've been serving on this
 
03:24:10.920 --> 03:24:12.590 align:start position:0%
John Hunt I've been serving on this
committee

03:24:12.590 --> 03:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
um a long time I was first elected in 86
 
03:24:18.960 --> 03:24:22.010 align:start position:0%
um a long time I was first elected in 86
1886.

03:24:22.010 --> 03:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:24.889 --> 03:24:24.899 align:start position:0%
and uh my first term was science and
 
03:24:26.389 --> 03:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
technology which you're actually sitting
 
03:24:27.830 --> 03:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
on the science technology side of the
 
03:24:30.110 --> 03:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
cootie Roman
 
03:24:31.370 --> 03:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
um I couldn't get off that committee
 
03:24:33.950 --> 03:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
fast enough and uh because
 
03:24:36.110 --> 03:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
it was all anti-seabrook stuff but way
 
03:24:37.070 --> 03:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
back then
 
03:24:39.530 --> 03:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
and then but then there was this other
 
03:24:39.540 --> 03:24:40.910 align:start position:0%
and then but then there was this other
committee

03:24:40.910 --> 03:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:24:42.950 --> 03:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
um and that they seem to have a lot more
 
03:24:45.710 --> 03:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
fun and uh because it was Interstate
 
03:24:47.750 --> 03:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
banking was the big issue and they
 
03:24:50.150 --> 03:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
seemed to have an event every week they
 
03:24:53.630 --> 03:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
were at events and and um and so I said
 
03:24:55.610 --> 03:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
well I want to get on that committee and
 
03:24:57.969 --> 03:24:57.979 align:start position:0%
then in over the time over the years
 
03:25:00.889 --> 03:25:00.899 align:start position:0%
this committee has expanded in terms of
 
03:25:05.510 --> 03:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
its uh realm of issues so we picked up
 
03:25:05.520 --> 03:25:06.830 align:start position:0%
its uh realm of issues so we picked up
liquor

03:25:06.830 --> 03:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
liquor
 
03:25:11.570 --> 03:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
and condos and trusts so we it's a
 
03:25:13.370 --> 03:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
little bit of everything when it comes
 
03:25:15.950 --> 03:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
to this committee so um it might be a
 
03:25:17.690 --> 03:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
little hard to follow sometimes when we
 
03:25:19.429 --> 03:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
jump from subject matter to subject
 
03:25:20.570 --> 03:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
matter because we're going to go buy
 
03:25:23.210 --> 03:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
Bill numbers but
 
03:25:25.729 --> 03:25:25.739 align:start position:0%
um uh we do we we do have a method to
 
03:25:27.229 --> 03:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
our Madness
 
03:25:29.750 --> 03:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
Obsession and this is an exec session
 
03:25:31.849 --> 03:25:31.859 align:start position:0%
which is very important because this is
 
03:25:35.269 --> 03:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
the vote that the uh the house when the
 
03:25:37.670 --> 03:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
house takes up action this will be the
 
03:25:40.309 --> 03:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
vote that they will be ratifying which
 
03:25:41.630 --> 03:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
is another one of those confusing things
 
03:25:42.950 --> 03:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
when you see what happens on the house
 
03:25:45.469 --> 03:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
floor because you're there you don't
 
03:25:47.269 --> 03:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
vote up or down on a bill you vote on
 
03:25:49.370 --> 03:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
based on the committee's recommendation
 
03:25:51.050 --> 03:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
so we're going to be making a
 
03:25:52.910 --> 03:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation and then it's taken up by
 
03:25:54.650 --> 03:25:54.660 align:start position:0%
the house
 
03:25:59.690 --> 03:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
so having said that uh House Bill 42
 
03:26:02.510 --> 03:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
relative to the operation of certain
 
03:26:05.929 --> 03:26:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:07.780 --> 03:26:07.790 align:start position:0%
who's going to carry this bill forward
 
03:26:07.790 --> 03:26:09.830 align:start position:0%
who's going to carry this bill forward
[Music]

03:26:09.830 --> 03:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:26:12.290 --> 03:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
what do we have here this one
 
03:26:14.870 --> 03:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
we have just a straight
 
03:26:16.729 --> 03:26:16.739 align:start position:0%
uh we have an amendment this one we have
 
03:26:19.570 --> 03:26:19.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:24.530 --> 03:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
yeah 0286h okay Rippers
 
03:26:26.990 --> 03:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
to who wants to write the board now I
 
03:26:28.910 --> 03:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
could write the blurb on everyone excuse
 
03:26:30.769 --> 03:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
me the majority report but I really want
 
03:26:33.710 --> 03:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
everybody to volunteer here now you want
 
03:26:40.929 --> 03:26:40.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:43.969 --> 03:26:43.979 align:start position:0%
pretty much 100 a year that you got you
 
03:26:48.170 --> 03:26:48.180 align:start position:0%
here right all right okay
 
03:26:50.570 --> 03:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
so the homeowners association who has a
 
03:26:53.389 --> 03:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
condo what was it tell me is it do we
 
03:26:58.849 --> 03:26:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:58.859 --> 03:27:06.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:27:06.550 --> 03:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:15.610 --> 03:27:15.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:17.929 --> 03:27:17.939 align:start position:0%
do you like to make uh the right
 
03:27:20.690 --> 03:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
recommendations I can help you out when
 
03:27:24.590 --> 03:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:24.600 --> 03:27:26.210 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:27:26.210 --> 03:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:27:26.220 --> 03:27:27.410 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

03:27:27.410 --> 03:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:27:31.309 --> 03:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll move I'll move on
 
03:27:33.650 --> 03:27:33.660 align:start position:0%
exactly looking up the amendment when
 
03:27:35.870 --> 03:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
you when I didn't hear you okay so I'm
 
03:27:37.309 --> 03:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
really not ready to do that I'm sorry
 
03:27:37.319 --> 03:27:38.809 align:start position:0%
really not ready to do that I'm sorry
okay

03:27:38.809 --> 03:27:38.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:27:40.910 --> 03:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
um so I'll move and and representative
 
03:27:43.190 --> 03:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
Burroughs was second uh ought to pass on
 
03:27:44.590 --> 03:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment number
 
03:27:48.010 --> 03:27:48.020 align:start position:0%
0286 H
 
03:27:52.010 --> 03:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
and this amendment
 
03:28:00.410 --> 03:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:15.170 --> 03:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:15.180 --> 03:28:24.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:28:24.290 --> 03:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:27.170 --> 03:28:27.180 align:start position:0%
okay uh it does have my name on it so
 
03:28:27.180 --> 03:28:28.250 align:start position:0%
okay uh it does have my name on it so
okay

03:28:28.250 --> 03:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:28:31.309 --> 03:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
um so what this is this is the issue of
 
03:28:34.729 --> 03:28:34.739 align:start position:0%
of when you actually have a homeowners
 
03:28:39.290 --> 03:28:39.300 align:start position:0%
association and someone wants to try to
 
03:28:39.300 --> 03:28:40.150 align:start position:0%
association and someone wants to try to
um

03:28:40.150 --> 03:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:42.010 --> 03:28:42.020 align:start position:0%
uh end
 
03:28:45.830 --> 03:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
the uh Association and
 
03:28:48.969 --> 03:28:48.979 align:start position:0%
um that if the association was created
 
03:28:51.650 --> 03:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
by their planning board if the planning
 
03:28:53.630 --> 03:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
boards when they did the initial

okay
 
03:36:36.650 --> 03:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
yeah so retaining means uh the bill
 
03:36:38.630 --> 03:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
stays in committee does not go to the
 
03:36:42.650 --> 03:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
house floor uh and uh we would then uh
 
03:36:45.849 --> 03:36:45.859 align:start position:0%
come by the end of October of this year
 
03:36:49.130 --> 03:36:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh the committee will then have to have
 
03:36:51.550 --> 03:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
taken and will take action again
 
03:36:55.790 --> 03:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
and at that time we can uh either pass
 
03:36:57.710 --> 03:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
it or mend it work on it do something
 
03:37:00.110 --> 03:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
with it and then it would come out on
 
03:37:02.630 --> 03:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
the house floor the first week of
 
03:37:02.640 --> 03:37:03.950 align:start position:0%
the house floor the first week of
January

03:37:03.950 --> 03:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
January
 
03:37:05.870 --> 03:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
so I've always said that the most
 
03:37:08.510 --> 03:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
exciting week on the lettuce if you want
 
03:37:10.610 --> 03:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
to see the legislature in action is uh
 
03:37:12.530 --> 03:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
that first week of January because that
 
03:37:14.210 --> 03:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
means all those bills that didn't come
 
03:37:16.309 --> 03:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
out of committee that were because of
 
03:37:18.349 --> 03:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
whatever usually some controversy or
 
03:37:20.990 --> 03:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
some a lot of discussion going on that
 
03:37:22.670 --> 03:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
that then that excitement happens the
 
03:37:25.550 --> 03:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
first week of January
 
03:37:29.170 --> 03:37:29.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:32.150 --> 03:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
you've been there done that before
 
03:37:34.610 --> 03:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
actually the former chair with the
 
03:37:35.929 --> 03:37:35.939 align:start position:0%
Democratic chair of this committee who's
 
03:37:38.150 --> 03:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
not here anymore but he always used to
 
03:37:40.010 --> 03:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
go to New York that week and I always
 
03:37:43.010 --> 03:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
told us I said how can you go away the
 
03:37:45.170 --> 03:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
most exciting week of the year right
 
03:37:47.150 --> 03:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
there was his tradition to go to New
 
03:37:50.929 --> 03:37:50.939 align:start position:0%
York okay House Bill 225 relative to
 
03:37:52.849 --> 03:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the use of currency that
 
03:37:57.769 --> 03:37:57.779 align:start position:0%
could be detrimental to privacy rights
 
03:37:57.779 --> 03:37:59.990 align:start position:0%
could be detrimental to privacy rights
okay

03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:38:02.809 --> 03:38:02.819 align:start position:0%

all right
 
03:38:18.229 --> 03:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:21.590 --> 03:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon yes
 
03:38:21.600 --> 03:38:23.630 align:start position:0%

petusic yes Terry yes post yes Cole yes
 
03:38:34.990 --> 03:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
sellers yes Paxton yes Walsh yes
 
03:38:38.389 --> 03:38:38.399 align:start position:0%

03:39:01.190 --> 03:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
yep 19-0
 
03:39:05.090 --> 03:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
okay next up HB 227 relative to Fair
 
03:39:08.570 --> 03:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
access to financial services
 
03:39:10.070 --> 03:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
I would say that when we do all these
 
03:39:11.750 --> 03:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
retained motions
 
03:39:11.760 --> 03:39:12.889 align:start position:0%
retained motions
um

03:39:12.889 --> 03:39:12.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:15.469 --> 03:39:15.479 align:start position:0%
there's another uh concept that people
 
03:39:19.070 --> 03:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
say it's uh it's killing the bill gently
 
03:39:21.290 --> 03:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
and that is the bill doesn't totally die
 
03:39:22.610 --> 03:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
because it's still in the committee and
 
03:39:25.010 --> 03:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
we still work on it but
 
03:39:27.290 --> 03:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
um there is a there is a high
 
03:39:29.150 --> 03:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
probability that some of these bills
 
03:39:32.929 --> 03:39:32.939 align:start position:0%
come next January with the interim study
 
03:39:35.389 --> 03:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
and so they never actually get out of
 
03:39:35.399 --> 03:39:37.849 align:start position:0%
and so they never actually get out of
committee

03:39:37.849 --> 03:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:39:37.859 --> 03:39:41.929 align:start position:0%
committee
okay

03:39:41.929 --> 03:39:41.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:44.690 --> 03:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
that's gonna happen
 
03:39:44.700 --> 03:39:46.510 align:start position:0%
that's gonna happen
okay

03:39:46.510 --> 03:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:39:49.309 --> 03:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
03:39:51.769 --> 03:39:51.779 align:start position:0%
yeah so who made the motion again
 
03:39:54.950 --> 03:39:54.960 align:start position:0%

03:39:56.590 --> 03:39:56.600 align:start position:0%

03:39:58.429 --> 03:39:58.439 align:start position:0%

03:40:06.410 --> 03:40:06.420 align:start position:0%

legislate
 
03:41:41.570 --> 03:41:41.580 align:start position:0%

speak to his motion
 
03:41:45.170 --> 03:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chair um this bill has
 
03:41:46.550 --> 03:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
been before this committee at least
 
03:41:49.309 --> 03:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
seven times and every time the committee
 
03:41:51.650 --> 03:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
has it yelled it um
 
03:41:53.870 --> 03:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
my thinking is if
 
03:41:56.330 --> 03:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
we don't want the state to run a
 
03:41:58.729 --> 03:41:58.739 align:start position:0%
trucking company or any other type of
 
03:42:00.769 --> 03:42:00.779 align:start position:0%
Industry we wouldn't want the state to
 
03:42:03.590 --> 03:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
run a bank either so in that vein I
 
03:42:06.290 --> 03:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
would uh move to itl
 
03:42:08.030 --> 03:42:08.040 align:start position:0%

03:44:14.150 --> 03:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
prepaying it and so then uh twice a year
 
03:44:16.130 --> 03:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
they then write a check and pay for your
 
03:44:17.630 --> 03:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
pay your tax bill
 
03:44:19.610 --> 03:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
and the question that always comes up is
 
03:44:22.070 --> 03:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
if you're if that money if you're paying
 
03:44:24.050 --> 03:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
all that money into this account you
 
03:44:26.269 --> 03:44:26.279 align:start position:0%
should be earning interest on that money
 
03:44:28.729 --> 03:44:28.739 align:start position:0%
that's in the account uh the system
 
03:44:31.130 --> 03:44:31.140 align:start position:0%
under the current statute who is a very
 
03:44:33.650 --> 03:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
complicated convoluted and and
 
03:44:37.550 --> 03:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable for everybody involved and
 
03:44:40.790 --> 03:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
so uh we are now uh proposing that we're
 
03:44:44.510 --> 03:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
using a new rate uh rate uh chart that's
 
03:44:47.650 --> 03:44:47.660 align:start position:0%
actually put out by the FDIC
 
03:44:51.530 --> 03:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
and uh and uh they have created a system
 
03:44:54.349 --> 03:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
that is easy to reference what this
 
03:44:57.110 --> 03:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
amendment does is remove the last line
 
03:45:01.550 --> 03:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
in the bill that was proposed that had a
 
03:45:04.910 --> 03:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
minimum and a cap on on what the
 
03:45:06.769 --> 03:45:06.779 align:start position:0%
interest was
 
03:45:08.090 --> 03:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
um especially since right now we're
 
03:45:11.690 --> 03:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
starting to see caps start to to uh rise
 
03:45:12.889 --> 03:45:12.899 align:start position:0%
because interest Insurance interest
 
03:45:15.410 --> 03:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
rates are going up so we certainly
 
03:45:16.969 --> 03:45:16.979 align:start position:0%
um uh would be doing everybody a
 
03:45:18.650 --> 03:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
disservice and we didn't allow them to
 
03:45:20.570 --> 03:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
take advantage of that escalating
 
03:45:23.990 --> 03:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
interest that was available to them
 
03:45:25.910 --> 03:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
um but over the last couple years
 
03:45:27.889 --> 03:45:27.899 align:start position:0%
obviously uh for a fair amount of years
 
03:45:29.630 --> 03:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been any interest at all
 
03:45:33.229 --> 03:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
because uh the interest rates being so
 
03:45:33.239 --> 03:45:34.130 align:start position:0%
because uh the interest rates being so
low

03:45:34.130 --> 03:45:34.140 align:start position:0%
low
 
03:45:36.530 --> 03:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
so with that is there any more
 
03:45:41.510 --> 03:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:43.729 --> 03:45:43.739 align:start position:0%

03:56:42.349 --> 03:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon has a motion I have
 
03:56:43.969 --> 03:56:43.979 align:start position:0%
a motion
 
03:56:45.670 --> 03:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:56:48.650 --> 03:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
the motion is to retain second by
 
03:56:50.330 --> 03:56:50.340 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs and I'd like to
 
03:56:52.550 --> 03:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
speak to my motion
 
03:56:52.560 --> 03:56:53.809 align:start position:0%
speak to my motion
yes

03:56:53.809 --> 03:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:56:56.570 --> 03:56:56.580 align:start position:0%
so we could do this fast or we could do
 
03:56:58.969 --> 03:56:58.979 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
03:57:02.090 --> 03:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
we could do it right and uh in in recent
 
03:57:03.769 --> 03:57:03.779 align:start position:0%
discussions including with attorney
 
03:57:06.229 --> 03:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
Arden you're just at lunch today so just
 
03:57:08.750 --> 03:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
about an hour ago this is an update we
 
03:57:10.130 --> 03:57:10.140 align:start position:0%
would like to work on this over the
 
03:57:10.140 --> 03:57:11.090 align:start position:0%
would like to work on this over the
summer

03:57:11.090 --> 03:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
summer
 
03:57:12.950 --> 03:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:57:15.290 --> 03:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
my fear is that it takes a sense of
 
03:57:19.010 --> 03:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
urgency and uh that a retain is death
 
03:57:21.769 --> 03:57:21.779 align:start position:0%
With Dignity for a bill and I really
 
03:57:23.630 --> 03:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
hope this isn't the case with this bill
 
03:57:25.729 --> 03:57:25.739 align:start position:0%
because it's the very first
 
03:57:28.250 --> 03:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
recommendation on the governor's crypto
 
03:57:30.170 --> 03:57:30.180 align:start position:0%
uh commission cryptocurrency and digital
 
03:57:31.809 --> 03:57:31.819 align:start position:0%
asset commission that we spent a year
 
03:57:34.670 --> 03:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
developing so there's a lot of momentum
 
03:57:37.490 --> 03:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
for this and uh I think retain is the
 
03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
right way to go and instead of waiting
 
03:57:40.070 --> 03:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
until next week to announce that I'd
 
03:57:42.710 --> 03:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
like to do it today and uh you know for
 
03:57:44.990 --> 03:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
respect from for the for the committee's
 
03:57:47.630 --> 03:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
time so move to routine
 
03:57:49.490 --> 03:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
okay any discussion on the motion to
 
03:57:49.500 --> 03:57:50.990 align:start position:0%
okay any discussion on the motion to
retain

03:57:50.990 --> 03:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
retain
 
03:57:51.000 --> 03:58:01.990 align:start position:0%
retain
right

03:58:01.990 --> 03:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:09.950 --> 03:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:20.809 --> 03:58:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:22.910 --> 03:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
is it likely or is it under
 
03:58:25.130 --> 03:58:25.140 align:start position:0%
consideration a little closer to the mic
 
03:58:28.130 --> 03:58:28.140 align:start position:0%
if this were too
 
03:58:30.769 --> 03:58:30.779 align:start position:0%
um the amendment were to pass and
 
03:58:34.189 --> 03:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
and the bill to pass that we would find
 
03:58:35.929 --> 03:58:35.939 align:start position:0%
ourselves establishing
 
03:58:37.670 --> 03:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
a bank
 
03:58:43.189 --> 03:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:46.790 --> 03:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
can I answer that absolutely so if you
 
03:58:49.610 --> 03:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
use a dowel so
 
03:58:52.130 --> 03:58:52.140 align:start position:0%
the The Entity would be a limited
 
03:58:53.809 --> 03:58:53.819 align:start position:0%
liability Dao and that's what other
 
03:58:55.490 --> 03:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
states are doing
 
03:58:58.790 --> 03:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
um you would still have to apply for a
 
03:59:00.769 --> 03:59:00.779 align:start position:0%
license if you were a bank
 
03:59:02.630 --> 03:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
so you would still be subject to the
 
03:59:05.450 --> 03:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
banking walls as a Dell just like you
 
03:59:08.689 --> 03:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
would if you if you created an LLC you
 
03:59:09.769 --> 03:59:09.779 align:start position:0%
would also have you know if you were
 
03:59:11.750 --> 03:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
going to create a bank under an LLC or
 
03:59:13.370 --> 03:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
some other corporate structure you'd
 
03:59:15.290 --> 03:59:15.300 align:start position:0%
still be have to comply with the banking
 
03:59:18.650 --> 03:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
regulations well my my question is
 
03:59:21.110 --> 03:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
in other words I'm I'm taking that as a
 
03:59:26.689 --> 03:59:26.699 align:start position:0%
yes it could be that hey uh Dow might uh
 
03:59:28.670 --> 03:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
want to be involved in the banking
 
03:59:28.680 --> 03:59:31.010 align:start position:0%
want to be involved in the banking
business

03:59:31.010 --> 03:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:33.170 --> 03:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
a dow could be involved in just about
 
03:59:34.849 --> 03:59:34.859 align:start position:0%
anything a regular Corporation could be
 
03:59:37.610 --> 03:59:37.620 align:start position:0%
involved in even uh private charity
 
03:59:39.110 --> 03:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
or some kind of uh you know
 
03:59:41.510 --> 03:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit purpose so anything that
 
03:59:45.050 --> 03:59:45.060 align:start position:0%
a corporation uh might consider as part
 
03:59:48.650 --> 03:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
of their mission a dow could also do
 
03:59:50.870 --> 03:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
something similar provided that they
 
03:59:53.510 --> 03:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
follow existing regulations for our
 
03:59:55.550 --> 03:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
highly regulated Industries all right
 
03:59:55.560 --> 03:59:56.710 align:start position:0%
highly regulated Industries all right
insurance

03:59:56.710 --> 03:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
04:00:00.550 --> 04:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
I just want the public to know that uh
 
04:00:04.670 --> 04:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:08.809 --> 04:00:08.819 align:start position:0%
those and and also cryptos
 
04:00:12.349 --> 04:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
desires to do banking transactions it is
 
04:00:14.990 --> 04:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
quite likely that one of those one of
 
04:00:20.389 --> 04:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:23.950 --> 04:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative Philip hello
 
04:00:26.990 --> 04:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh we'll get there
 
04:00:30.170 --> 04:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
uh I think it would be it's possible but
 
04:00:33.490 --> 04:00:33.500 align:start position:0%
difficult for a dow to create a bank
 
04:00:36.349 --> 04:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
that blockchain could create a ledger
 
04:00:39.710 --> 04:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
and ledgers are a means of tracking
 
04:00:42.769 --> 04:00:42.779 align:start position:0%
deposits deposits would be in the form
 
04:00:45.710 --> 04:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
of a currency and currencies are what
 
04:00:47.750 --> 04:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
governments issue
 
04:00:50.689 --> 04:00:50.699 align:start position:0%
that's an ideal way to keep a ledger of
 
04:00:52.849 --> 04:00:52.859 align:start position:0%
deposits and withdrawals would be in the
 
04:00:55.550 --> 04:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
form of blockchain and blockchain would
 
04:00:58.130 --> 04:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
actually be great for a ledger of
 
04:00:59.750 --> 04:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
deposits and withdrawals because it's
 
04:00:59.760 --> 04:01:00.769 align:start position:0%
deposits and withdrawals because it's
immutable

04:01:00.769 --> 04:01:00.779 align:start position:0%
immutable
 
04:01:02.689 --> 04:01:02.699 align:start position:0%
what better way to keep track of your
 
04:01:04.910 --> 04:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
money than something that could never be
 
04:01:07.250 --> 04:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
changed like blockchain
 
04:01:11.330 --> 04:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
but Banks work in currency and one
 
04:01:13.849 --> 04:01:13.859 align:start position:0%
entity issues currency which is a
 
04:01:16.370 --> 04:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
government the difficulty however would
 
04:01:19.490 --> 04:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
be where do you store said currency if
 
04:01:20.389 --> 04:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
you are
 
04:01:22.969 --> 04:01:22.979 align:start position:0%
uh a Dao where you have no physical
 
04:01:25.790 --> 04:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
existence if they can overcome that
 
04:01:28.370 --> 04:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
difficulty then they may be able to do
 
04:01:30.650 --> 04:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
so however given that we're moving
 
04:01:32.929 --> 04:01:32.939 align:start position:0%
towards a digital economy I don't
 
04:01:34.790 --> 04:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
actually hold any of the cash that I
 
04:01:36.469 --> 04:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
have despite the fact that I actually
 
04:01:39.469 --> 04:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
have money in my accounts I think that
 
04:01:42.410 --> 04:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
that could be overcome now I think the
 
04:01:45.110 --> 04:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
undertone may be are they going to work
 
04:01:48.170 --> 04:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
in blockchain or the Bitcoin or other
 
04:01:48.180 --> 04:01:49.790 align:start position:0%
in blockchain or the Bitcoin or other
cryptocurrencies

04:01:49.790 --> 04:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrencies
 
04:01:53.269 --> 04:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
they could given that those are a form
 
04:01:56.510 --> 04:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
of security get but they could work in
 
04:01:58.370 --> 04:01:58.380 align:start position:0%
any form of security they could decide
 
04:02:00.530 --> 04:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
that they want to trade in Coca-Cola or
 
04:02:03.110 --> 04:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
anything else that's traded on the NYSE
 
04:02:05.450 --> 04:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
if they were to get a license as a
 
04:02:07.130 --> 04:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
Securities broker
 
04:02:11.450 --> 04:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
they can do anything under the sun just
 
04:02:14.150 --> 04:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
as anybody can do anything under the sun
 
04:02:16.729 --> 04:02:16.739 align:start position:0%
you can do good things you can do bad
 
04:02:18.650 --> 04:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
things it's up to you as an individual
 
04:02:21.410 --> 04:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
we hope that they do good sometimes
 
04:02:23.689 --> 04:02:23.699 align:start position:0%
people do bad things that's their fault
 
04:02:25.309 --> 04:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
and then we go after them and the state
 
04:02:27.469 --> 04:02:27.479 align:start position:0%
has that power
 
04:02:29.510 --> 04:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that's great yeah but I would say
 
04:02:32.450 --> 04:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
in just a to having a little experience
 
04:02:35.570 --> 04:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
with the banking statute
 
04:02:37.309 --> 04:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
um that there are some other
 
04:02:39.349 --> 04:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
requirements of thresholds today would
 
04:02:40.910 --> 04:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
have to overcome that would be somewhat
 
04:02:43.910 --> 04:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
complicated for instance uh the banking
 
04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
department requires you to you if you
 
04:02:48.349 --> 04:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
get a license to to be a bank you have
 
04:02:51.110 --> 04:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
to have a physical location and so they
 
04:02:53.570 --> 04:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
can go audit your business and so the
 
04:02:56.210 --> 04:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
books have to be audible so there will
 
04:02:59.450 --> 04:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
be a lot of uh threshold uh things that
 
04:03:02.870 --> 04:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:04.610 --> 04:03:04.620 align:start position:0%
I correct that also to have a bank you'd
 
04:03:06.170 --> 04:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
also need to have a certain amount in
 
04:03:08.269 --> 04:03:08.279 align:start position:0%
your initial assets to be a bank which
 
04:03:10.429 --> 04:03:10.439 align:start position:0%
is going to be pretty difficult for many
 
04:03:12.110 --> 04:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
organizations to overcome in the first
 
04:03:13.550 --> 04:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
place because you need to have insurable
 
04:03:16.309 --> 04:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
assets right you know and and we talk
 
04:03:18.670 --> 04:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
about depository Banks
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
so yeah and you've got to have actual
 
04:03:24.290 --> 04:03:24.300 align:start position:0%
real dollars behind it to to open up the
 
04:03:27.050 --> 04:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
bank so I still have concerns in that
 
04:03:31.929 --> 04:03:31.939 align:start position:0%
regard starting with the fact that uh
 
04:03:34.849 --> 04:03:34.859 align:start position:0%
monetary Sovereign Nation it's it's one
 
04:03:37.969 --> 04:03:37.979 align:start position:0%
nation one money and if we have a
 
04:03:39.650 --> 04:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
situation where we have a private
 
04:03:45.550 --> 04:03:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:49.790 --> 04:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
that that's my concern and I'm okay that
 
04:03:51.889 --> 04:03:51.899 align:start position:0%
is fine we appreciate that you are
 
04:03:53.330 --> 04:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
willing to share us why you have
 
04:03:53.340 --> 04:03:57.070 align:start position:0%
willing to share us why you have
concerns

04:03:57.070 --> 04:03:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:59.570 --> 04:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
so one interesting thing to consider
 
04:04:01.670 --> 04:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
about a dow that operates on a
 
04:04:04.910 --> 04:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
blockchain in smart contracts is the the
 
04:04:07.250 --> 04:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
activity of the Dow is
 
04:04:09.349 --> 04:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
open to the public and it's auditable
 
04:04:12.950 --> 04:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
and it's uh in a format where the code
 
04:04:14.929 --> 04:04:14.939 align:start position:0%
can be reviewed the transactions can be
 
04:04:16.670 --> 04:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
reviewed that's different than a private
 
04:04:18.050 --> 04:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
organization so
 
04:04:21.170 --> 04:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
this the spirit of 645 is to leverage
 
04:04:24.110 --> 04:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
that transparency so that we have uh you
 
04:04:26.510 --> 04:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
know we can weed out the Bad actors by
 
04:04:29.570 --> 04:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
having lots of eyeballs on that activity
 
04:04:31.910 --> 04:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
that that is open to the public so it's
 
04:04:33.830 --> 04:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit different than a a private
 
04:04:36.110 --> 04:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
company that has the book secret the
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
decision making is secret and so we want
 
04:04:41.389 --> 04:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
to facilitate that because sunlight is
 
04:04:43.849 --> 04:04:43.859 align:start position:0%
the best disinfectant so and that would
 
04:04:45.710 --> 04:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
be their marketing right marketing
 
04:04:48.110 --> 04:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
approach okay the motion is to retain
 
04:04:49.849 --> 04:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
any more discussion on the motion seen
 
04:04:53.570 --> 04:04:53.580 align:start position:0%

Seventeen two yep right okay about 17-2
 
04:05:42.050 --> 04:05:42.060 align:start position:0%
all right house bill 173 relative to
 
04:05:43.849 --> 04:05:43.859 align:start position:0%
toilet facilities provided by
 
04:05:43.859 --> 04:05:45.170 align:start position:0%
toilet facilities provided by
restaurants

04:05:45.170 --> 04:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
04:05:51.349 --> 04:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:53.450 --> 04:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
no this is retained because this this
 
04:05:53.460 --> 04:05:54.590 align:start position:0%
no this is retained because this this
bill

04:05:54.590 --> 04:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:05:57.349 --> 04:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
this bill he wanted us to he wanted us
 
04:06:00.110 --> 04:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
actually to repeal the law the guy from
 
04:06:02.210 --> 04:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
the bill the bill he wanted us to repeal
 
04:06:05.210 --> 04:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
it but not yet until they've approved
 
04:06:07.550 --> 04:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
the Knicks round of Boca
 
04:06:09.349 --> 04:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
um and then and then then we'll get to
 
04:06:11.210 --> 04:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
repeal it so we'll hold on to it and
 
04:06:14.990 --> 04:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
this will come out in January with a uh
 
04:06:17.030 --> 04:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
an amendment that will repeal the whole
 
04:06:18.530 --> 04:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
statute altogether
 
04:06:20.990 --> 04:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay so I guess I would put that under
 
04:06:23.090 --> 04:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
my name okay
 
04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%

04:06:32.510 --> 04:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
right and this is two to retain
 
04:06:32.520 --> 04:06:34.429 align:start position:0%
right and this is two to retain
okay

04:06:34.429 --> 04:06:34.439 align:start position:0%

um the retain is due to the fact that

I have a question oh
 
04:09:43.790 --> 04:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert despite the fact
 
04:09:45.469 --> 04:09:45.479 align:start position:0%
that we're going to do what you want to
 
04:09:50.090 --> 04:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
do the uh it still is allowable that
 
04:09:52.969 --> 04:09:52.979 align:start position:0%
somebody on doing it on a farmer's
 
04:09:55.550 --> 04:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
market or a something like that level
 
04:09:59.090 --> 04:09:59.100 align:start position:0%
that's being a certified kitchen and yes
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's good the answer to your question
 
04:10:05.750 --> 04:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
is no they they need to be licensed as a
 
04:10:07.250 --> 04:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
certified kitchen
 
04:10:10.429 --> 04:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
yes virtual kitchen if you're going to
 
04:10:12.010 --> 04:10:12.020 align:start position:0%
sell it if you're going to give away
 
04:10:14.630 --> 04:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried food for free unless you
 
04:10:14.640 --> 04:10:16.790 align:start position:0%
freeze-dried food for free unless you
why

04:10:16.790 --> 04:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:10:19.910 --> 04:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
if you live in the 10 towns that have
 
04:10:22.250 --> 04:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
kind of of code that will allow them to
 
04:10:23.570 --> 04:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
have those commercial kitchens in their
 
04:10:24.530 --> 04:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
own homes
 
04:10:26.570 --> 04:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
you may do that otherwise it has to be
 
04:10:27.710 --> 04:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
in a commercial kitchen if you don't
 
04:10:29.929 --> 04:10:29.939 align:start position:0%
live in those 10 Towns
 
04:10:33.290 --> 04:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
no big well let's just say the state law
 
04:10:34.990 --> 04:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
which is what we deal with we don't
 
04:10:38.870 --> 04:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
state law right now requires that if you
 
04:10:40.969 --> 04:10:40.979 align:start position:0%
want to sell
 
04:10:45.130 --> 04:10:45.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:47.870 --> 04:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
a commit kitchen that has been approved
 
04:10:52.729 --> 04:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
uh by the HHS okay I just yeah I just
 
04:10:54.110 --> 04:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
thought you know
 
04:10:56.210 --> 04:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
it would make a good small business if
 
04:10:57.950 --> 04:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted to do it and could put
 
04:11:00.349 --> 04:11:00.359 align:start position:0%
the money up I just that's my only
 
04:11:02.630 --> 04:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
concern that we kind of squelched no
 
04:11:05.389 --> 04:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:05.399 --> 04:11:09.650 align:start position:0%

04:11:09.650 --> 04:11:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:09.660 --> 04:11:12.610 align:start position:0%

they can find somebody in New Hampshire

Massachusetts for too long so but
 
04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise the money goes into a fund and

then we distribute the money and it's a
 
04:13:58.189 --> 04:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
major the suspense is to maintain the
 
04:14:00.170 --> 04:14:00.180 align:start position:0%

representative hunt moves to retain
 
04:18:20.330 --> 04:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
5 44.
 
04:18:21.710 --> 04:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
and representative Philly I was
 
04:18:24.170 --> 04:18:24.180 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak to his motion
 
04:18:27.530 --> 04:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
this uh Bill sought to legalize cannabis
 
04:18:29.150 --> 04:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
in the state as overseen by The Liquor
 
04:18:30.590 --> 04:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
Commission however we've had another
 
04:18:32.210 --> 04:18:32.220 align:start position:0%
bill that has come to this committee and
 
04:18:33.650 --> 04:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
has now been passed to the house which
 
04:18:36.050 --> 04:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
sought to do the same thing and has a
 
04:18:37.670 --> 04:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support
 
04:18:39.650 --> 04:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
uh retaining this bill would allow us to
 
04:18:42.349 --> 04:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
take a wait and see approach and then
 
04:18:44.630 --> 04:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
pass this bill next year potentially if
 
04:18:46.969 --> 04:18:46.979 align:start position:0%
the the current bill were to fail either
 
04:18:49.969 --> 04:18:49.979 align:start position:0%
in the house or elsewhere so I think
 
04:18:51.830 --> 04:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
taking this would allow us to get a
 
04:18:53.330 --> 04:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
second bite of the Apple if we need to
 
04:18:55.550 --> 04:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
do so
 
04:18:55.560 --> 04:18:57.650 align:start position:0%
do so
excellent

04:18:57.650 --> 04:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
04:19:00.110 --> 04:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
any more discussion on the motion to
 
04:19:02.630 --> 04:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
retain Representatives would you like to
 
04:19:05.630 --> 04:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
weigh in yes I would I'd like to make a
 
04:19:08.150 --> 04:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
motion to itl this we have a pending
 
04:19:09.729 --> 04:19:09.739 align:start position:0%
motion so all right
 
04:19:14.150 --> 04:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:16.729 --> 04:19:16.739 align:start position:0%
you can speak against the pending motion
 
04:19:18.469 --> 04:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
all right I'd like to speak against it
 
04:19:22.269 --> 04:19:22.279 align:start position:0%
and uh as an esteemed colleague had said
 
04:19:25.790 --> 04:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
previously if we don't want the state
 
04:19:29.030 --> 04:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
having control over bank I don't think
 
04:19:30.950 --> 04:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
we should have the state controlling an
 
04:19:34.550 --> 04:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
illegal drug if the federal government
 
04:19:37.610 --> 04:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
is important enough as to what their
 
04:19:40.010 --> 04:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
opinion is for pfas I would think it's
 
04:19:42.110 --> 04:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
also important that they have not
 
04:19:44.269 --> 04:19:44.279 align:start position:0%
legalized cannabis
 
04:19:44.279 --> 04:19:47.510 align:start position:0%

just just 400 affiliate
 
04:25:50.210 --> 04:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
I'd move that we would ought to pass
 
04:25:52.309 --> 04:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
this uh motion this bill because it
 
04:25:54.649 --> 04:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
merely cease to create a study committee
 
04:25:56.870 --> 04:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
for an all-pare system as we've seen
 
04:25:58.610 --> 04:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
from Maryland an all-payer system could
 
04:26:00.590 --> 04:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost of Health Care in the
 
04:26:00.600 --> 04:26:01.370 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost of Health Care in the
state

04:26:01.370 --> 04:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
while that may not work in New Hampshire
 
04:26:05.630 --> 04:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
a committee would simply seek to
 
04:26:07.849 --> 04:26:07.859 align:start position:0%
determine whether it would or not and
 
04:26:09.410 --> 04:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
whether what the New Hampshire way would
 
04:26:11.450 --> 04:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
be for doing this it would create a
 
04:26:14.149 --> 04:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
bipartisan committee to study this and
 
04:26:15.950 --> 04:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
there's no loss in creating a study to
 
04:26:17.389 --> 04:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
determine if this would work in New
 
04:26:20.689 --> 04:26:20.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or not yeah the problem is a I
 
04:26:22.130 --> 04:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
don't know there could be bipartisan
 
04:26:26.510 --> 04:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
because you're you have one you have one
 
04:26:26.520 --> 04:26:27.969 align:start position:0%
because you're you have one you have one
senator

04:26:27.969 --> 04:26:27.979 align:start position:0%
senator
 
04:26:31.849 --> 04:26:31.859 align:start position:0%
and four is it four representatives and
 
04:26:33.229 --> 04:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
then you get all these other people who
 
04:26:35.030 --> 04:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
are being appointed we have no idea what
 
04:26:37.729 --> 04:26:37.739 align:start position:0%
their political persuasion is so the
 
04:26:41.030 --> 04:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
idea is and I'm committed to uh finding
 
04:26:44.149 --> 04:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
someone who is an expert on their system
 
04:26:47.149 --> 04:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
and have them come in and speak to the
 
04:26:49.189 --> 04:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
committee and just be with this
 
04:26:50.929 --> 04:26:50.939 align:start position:0%
committee rather than having the
 
04:26:52.610 --> 04:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
governor and the speaker and all these
 
04:26:55.429 --> 04:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
other appointments when when when the
 
04:26:57.290 --> 04:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
idea is just to be educated about what
 
04:26:59.510 --> 04:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
it is so I think it's worthwhile to just
 
04:27:04.729 --> 04:27:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:07.849 --> 04:27:07.859 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman we also heard testimony
 
04:27:12.410 --> 04:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
that um these systems were being passed
 
04:27:14.090 --> 04:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
or had implemented in other states but
 
04:27:15.830 --> 04:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
we don't really have any solid evidence
 
04:27:17.510 --> 04:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
that effect so no it's just Maryland
 
04:27:18.950 --> 04:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
there's more work that needs to be done
 
04:27:22.490 --> 04:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
on this thank you what's up okay
 
04:27:25.729 --> 04:27:25.739 align:start position:0%

my notes say we have I tailed it oh this
 
04:28:57.950 --> 04:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
is us this year is it this is this is
 
04:28:59.870 --> 04:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
the committee that this is runs on the
 
04:29:05.590 --> 04:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
idea that you're going to create find a
 
04:29:08.110 --> 04:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
a health plan
 
04:29:12.649 --> 04:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
that has the same mandates the same
 
04:29:14.809 --> 04:29:14.819 align:start position:0%
requirements the same everything same
 
04:29:17.210 --> 04:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
same same and that you're going to find
 
04:29:20.210 --> 04:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
multiple states that are going to have
 
04:29:23.090 --> 04:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
that same thing so I can tell you you
 
04:29:26.269 --> 04:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
know on on the face of this is that just
 
04:29:28.130 --> 04:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
in our New England states each of us
 
04:29:30.469 --> 04:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
have different mandates we have written
 
04:29:33.410 --> 04:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
our mandates differently so to get all
 
04:29:35.389 --> 04:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
the New England states to all come up
 
04:29:38.990 --> 04:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
with the same mandate so just the same
 
04:29:42.530 --> 04:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
language the same requirements
 
04:29:44.510 --> 04:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
um it's impossible
 
04:29:46.250 --> 04:29:46.260 align:start position:0%

and and the 172 was to study uh whether
 
04:34:49.310 --> 04:34:49.320 align:start position:0%

benefit managers
 
04:35:50.510 --> 04:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
this is a retain
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:55.199 --> 04:36:02.090 align:start position:0%
 
second

04:36:02.090 --> 04:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:05.209 --> 04:36:05.219 align:start position:0%
okay any discussion on the motion
 
04:36:07.849 --> 04:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
I have a question yes
 
04:36:07.859 --> 04:36:11.410 align:start position:0%
I have a question yes
um

04:36:11.410 --> 04:36:11.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:14.449 --> 04:36:14.459 align:start position:0%
if I know anything about
 
04:36:16.490 --> 04:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
benefits managers
 
04:36:20.090 --> 04:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
uh being able to find out how they come
 
04:36:22.250 --> 04:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
up with their pricing is damn near
 
04:36:22.260 --> 04:36:23.349 align:start position:0%
up with their pricing is damn near
impossible

04:36:23.349 --> 04:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
04:36:27.529 --> 04:36:27.539 align:start position:0%
so uh I can see the the need to do it
 
04:36:29.209 --> 04:36:29.219 align:start position:0%
but I don't uh
 
04:36:32.390 --> 04:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard anything now yet that
 
04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
would give me the return of confidence
 
04:36:37.010 --> 04:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
that we would actually get to the main
 
04:36:37.020 --> 04:36:39.349 align:start position:0%
that we would actually get to the main
meal

04:36:39.349 --> 04:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
meal
 
04:36:43.070 --> 04:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so you're suggested we
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
should kill this bill yeah okay so this
 
04:36:48.289 --> 04:36:48.299 align:start position:0%
bill is actually it's it's a it's sort
 
04:36:50.510 --> 04:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
of a misnomer in terms of the standard
 
04:36:53.150 --> 04:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
for pharmacy benefit managers what this
 
04:36:55.970 --> 04:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
is is that if you're a independent
 
04:36:55.980 --> 04:36:57.529 align:start position:0%
is is that if you're a independent
pharmacist

04:36:57.529 --> 04:36:57.539 align:start position:0%
pharmacist
 
04:37:00.650 --> 04:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
and you have decided that you want to
 
04:37:02.750 --> 04:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
keep all your customers because you're
 
04:37:04.670 --> 04:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
in a small town and you don't want them
 
04:37:07.490 --> 04:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
to go mail order you don't want them to
 
04:37:12.131 --> 04:37:12.141 align:start position:0%
go travel to one of those big overpriced
 
04:37:14.631 --> 04:37:14.641 align:start position:0%
well let's say the pharmacy that's way
 
04:37:15.949 --> 04:37:15.959 align:start position:0%
in the back of the store and you have to
 
04:37:17.929 --> 04:37:17.939 align:start position:0%
go buy through all that groceries to get
 
04:37:17.939 --> 04:37:18.970 align:start position:0%
go buy through all that groceries to get
there

04:37:18.970 --> 04:37:18.980 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:37:22.789 --> 04:37:22.799 align:start position:0%
so you're uh and the irritation by these
 
04:37:26.869 --> 04:37:26.879 align:start position:0%
independent pharmacists is that when it
 
04:37:29.510 --> 04:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
comes time to get reimbursed their
 
04:37:32.631 --> 04:37:32.641 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is uh is lower than their
 
04:37:36.529 --> 04:37:36.539 align:start position:0%
actual cost because they were not in the
 
04:37:38.449 --> 04:37:38.459 align:start position:0%
network and not getting that same
 
04:37:41.209 --> 04:37:41.219 align:start position:0%
pricing and so this was the I think
 
04:37:42.230 --> 04:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
there was something in the bill about
 
04:37:46.029 --> 04:37:46.039 align:start position:0%
this minimum price level and some some
 
04:37:49.551 --> 04:37:49.561 align:start position:0%
bizarre description like that and that
 
04:37:53.510 --> 04:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
um and so the idea was that uh they that
 
04:37:56.510 --> 04:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
if if the PBM can actually find it at a
 
04:37:58.150 --> 04:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
cheap node that is in a cheaper price
 
04:38:01.189 --> 04:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
that they would pass that information on
 
04:38:03.349 --> 04:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
to the pharmacist which probably won't
 
04:38:04.849 --> 04:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
be much good because the pharmacist
 
04:38:06.650 --> 04:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
really can't do business with that
 
04:38:08.689 --> 04:38:08.699 align:start position:0%
wholesaler because they don't do enough
 
04:38:08.699 --> 04:38:09.650 align:start position:0%
wholesaler because they don't do enough
volume

04:38:09.650 --> 04:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
volume
 
04:38:11.869 --> 04:38:11.879 align:start position:0%
so that is what the issue of this bill
 
04:38:13.789 --> 04:38:13.799 align:start position:0%
is about and certainly it's going to
 
04:38:15.289 --> 04:38:15.299 align:start position:0%
take some head scratching to figure out
 
04:38:16.551 --> 04:38:16.561 align:start position:0%
how we're going to solve this problem
 
04:38:16.561 --> 04:38:21.470 align:start position:0%
how we're going to solve this problem
okay

04:38:21.470 --> 04:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:24.289 --> 04:38:24.299 align:start position:0%
okay about 383 and it sounded to me like
 
04:38:26.769 --> 04:38:26.779 align:start position:0%
you were talking about 426.
 
04:38:29.929 --> 04:38:29.939 align:start position:0%
no I'm talking about 383. the pharmacist
 
04:38:31.730 --> 04:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
in charge is a whole another another
 
04:38:33.590 --> 04:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's actually a bigger Pharmacy
 
04:38:35.929 --> 04:38:35.939 align:start position:0%
problem it's not that's not the
 
04:38:38.689 --> 04:38:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:42.170 --> 04:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
okay 383 is the problem I just described
 
04:38:45.349 --> 04:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion is to retain
 
04:38:48.170 --> 04:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
all right question clear clerk will call
 
04:38:49.789 --> 04:38:49.799 align:start position:0%

all right
 
04:55:16.730 --> 04:55:16.740 align:start position:0%
ready to vote
 
04:55:19.788 --> 04:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
okay moves uh in expedient to legislate
 
04:55:21.650 --> 04:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
and recommend a sphere representative
 
04:55:24.470 --> 04:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
Spears recognize you speak to her motion
 
04:55:29.270 --> 04:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh this this bill was to uh require a
 
04:55:33.350 --> 04:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
law actually that if a windshield was
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
replaced on a car that had driver
 
04:55:38.628 --> 04:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
assistance for uh
 
04:55:41.690 --> 04:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
speed or some other collision avoidance
 
04:55:43.970 --> 04:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
system that they might have that they
 
04:55:46.970 --> 04:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
would be told that the
 
04:55:49.070 --> 04:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
repair facility had to tell them whether
 
04:55:53.030 --> 04:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
or not they could calibrate the the
 
04:55:55.550 --> 04:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
the the the the the camera that's on the
 
04:55:58.010 --> 04:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
front windshield
 
04:56:02.030 --> 04:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh the problem with it once this there's
 
04:56:04.270 --> 04:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
a number of problems with it but
 
04:56:07.670 --> 04:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
replacing I mean calibrating the camera
 
04:56:10.070 --> 04:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
can be the result of much more than just
 
04:56:12.230 --> 04:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
replacing the glass that can be the
 
04:56:15.110 --> 04:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
result of uh driving on through a
 
04:56:16.670 --> 04:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
pothole there's a there's a number of
 
04:56:19.190 --> 04:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
things so it just got bigger and bigger
 
04:56:21.890 --> 04:56:21.900 align:start position:0%
and bigger and so it just became
 
04:56:24.590 --> 04:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
unwieldy yes unwielded it would be
 
04:56:24.600 --> 04:56:25.990 align:start position:0%
unwieldy yes unwielded it would be

04:58:10.490 --> 04:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
full faith that by the time we get get
 
04:58:13.128 --> 04:58:13.138 align:start position:0%
to these bills and come October we'll
 
04:58:15.650 --> 04:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
have a better resolution rather than
 
04:58:18.708 --> 04:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
just uh keep kicking the can but you
 
04:58:21.590 --> 04:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
