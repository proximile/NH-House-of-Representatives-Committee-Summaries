domestic violence advocacy project at
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legal assistance we
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
represent low-income victims and
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
survivors of domestic violence sexual
 
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
assault and stalking in their High
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
lethality protective order cases and

family law cases including divorce and
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
parenting I am here today to testify in
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
opposition of House Bill 547 first I
 
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
just want to thank and appreciate the
 
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.860 align:start position:0%
sponsor for his efforts to make things
 
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
better and safer for victims of domestic
 
00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:33.419 align:start position:0%
violence and their children in the
 
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
family court system
 
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
there are pieces of this bill that I
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
think are worth considering but
 
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
generally speaking this bill is a
 
00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
complete overhaul of the parental rights
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
and responsibility statute that we
 
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
currently have which if this bill is
 
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
passed would dramatically change the
 
00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
landscape of parental rights and
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in our state
 
00:07:59.450 --> 00:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
and those could have some negative
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
consequences for victims and practically
 
00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:04.979 align:start position:0%
speaking there are some things in this
 
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
bill which are not possible to implement
 
00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to go through the bill
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
line by line but I don't think even
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
within the three minutes that the
 
00:08:15.409 --> 00:08:15.419 align:start position:0%
committee has time to hear of that but I
 
00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
am happy to answer any questions that
 
00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:20.039 align:start position:0%
you may have I'm also happy to be a
 
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
resource on the family court system at
 
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
another time if that's helpful to the
 
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
committee but quickly I would like to go
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
over some of the major issues that we
 
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
found were problematic with this bill
 
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
first this bill requires a parent who is
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
found to be abusive to have supervised
 
00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
visitation with their children at a
 
00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:44.039 align:start position:0%
supervised visitation center using a
 
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
metal detector I am fully supportive of
 
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:50.300 align:start position:0%
the use of supervised visitation centers
 
00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:53.459 align:start position:0%
sadly we only have one left in our state
 
00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:56.519 align:start position:0%
which is in Dover that uses a metal
 
00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:00.740 align:start position:0%
detector and follows best practices
 
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
so practically speaking this would not
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
be a possibility for every parent who
 
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
has been found to abuse their partner or
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
their child to go to the one Center in
 
00:09:12.839 --> 00:09:14.570 align:start position:0%
their child to go to the one Center in
Dover

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
Dover
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
um secondly it requires the therapist to
 
00:09:20.329 --> 00:09:20.339 align:start position:0%
essentially clear an abusive parent for
 
00:09:20.339 --> 00:09:21.430 align:start position:0%
essentially clear an abusive parent for
visitation

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
visitation
 
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
no therapist will in my experience or
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
should ever uh clear somebody for
 
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.650 align:start position:0%
should ever uh clear somebody for
um

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
or state whether or not somebody has the
 
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
potential to abuse in the future
 
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
lastly this bill requires a restraining
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
order to be entered in all cases with no
 
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
exceptions for co-parenting contact
 
00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
again I'm supportive of the use of
 
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
marital and parenting restraining orders
 
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
but this would effectively elimit the
 
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
ability of parents to co-parent so it
 
00:09:58.730 --> 00:09:58.740 align:start position:0%
says in all cases there shall be a
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
restraining order entered so that means
 
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
if the restraining order is in place and
 
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
there's no provision for contact between
 
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
the parents regarding the children that
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
let's say Johnny wants to go to a play
 
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
date at Chuck E cheese Dad can't contact
 
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:19.740 align:start position:0%
mom to say I will pick up Johnny at
 
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
Chuck E cheese at four o'clock it would
 
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
eliminate any contact between the
 
00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:28.019 align:start position:0%
parties which again would make
 
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
co-parenting extremely difficult
 
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.090 align:start position:0%
co-parenting extremely difficult
um

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
again I I'm happy to answer any
 
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
questions these are the three major
 
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
issues that we saw with the bill there
 
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
are other issues so at this point we are
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
requesting the committee to vote in
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate or at the very
 
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
least push to a study committee to
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not changes to our
 
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
parental rights and responsibilities
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
statute need to be made and if so what
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
those changes might be thank you for
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
00:11:04.449 --> 00:11:04.459 align:start position:0%
um Bill writing 101.
 
00:11:08.449 --> 00:11:08.459 align:start position:0%
uh I see no co-sponsors so I do not see
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort at least in the
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
list of sponsors did the sponsor of the
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
bill reach out to you for your input
 
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
along the way no I'm going to ask that
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
of everybody who's going to come up and
 
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.449 align:start position:0%
of everybody who's going to come up and
speak

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:23.459 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:11:26.449 --> 00:11:26.459 align:start position:0%
um to your knowledge was their access of
 
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
what other states do
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know any of the background
 
00:11:32.569 --> 00:11:32.579 align:start position:0%
related to this bill we have 50 states
 
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:35.700 align:start position:0%
50 experiments in democracy we're not
 
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
the only ones who face this problem so
 
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
this is for anybody who cares to listen
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
collaborative efforts in terms of
 
00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:46.279 align:start position:0%
asking me to ask the committee
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
researcher what do other states do is
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
always important any questions of uh
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
Miss Justina yes welcome back thank you
 
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
did you work last night I did not I
 
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
worked uh day shift yesterday you're all
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
sparkly and fresh that's correct thank
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering how they would
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
prove that domestic violence happened
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's one of the issues that I
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
have with this bill that you have to
 
00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:21.899 align:start position:0%
prove and domestic violence can be very
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
difficult to prove agreed
 
00:12:26.449 --> 00:12:26.459 align:start position:0%
um there are some Provisions to show
 
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
that abuse occurred
 
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
um under 173b or 169 C uh I can't say
 
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
whether it requires that somebody get a
 
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:38.700 align:start position:0%
domestic violence protective order and
 
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
as we know even if somebody doesn't get
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
a domestic violence protective order
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that they are not a
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
victim of domestic violence sometimes it
 
00:12:48.889 --> 00:12:48.899 align:start position:0%
is not always the safest option for
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
somebody to seek a protective order
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
under 173b or 633 a which is our
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
stocking statute
 
00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
sometimes in Family Court
 
00:13:01.079 --> 00:13:01.970 align:start position:0%
sometimes in Family Court
um

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
people are able to testify to abuse that
 
00:13:06.889 --> 00:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
has occurred whether that be verbal
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
emotional physical abuse and the court
 
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
is able to make a finding of abuse and
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
they will use that finding to determine
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
decision making and residential
 
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.110 align:start position:0%
decision making and residential
responsibility

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
so it's unclear to answer your question
 
00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
more directly it is unclear in this bill
 
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
what would be required in order to make
 
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
those findings which would then lead to
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
the supervised visitation and then a
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
therapist determining somebody is
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
cleared uh for future visitation
 
00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:39.250 align:start position:0%
cleared uh for future visitation
unsupervised

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:39.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:42.899 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
 
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
um is it attorney Justina no I'm a
 
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:51.740 align:start position:0%
paralegal only then paralegal Ms Justine
 
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
although I am able to represent clients
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
in court now under the new rule that you
 
00:13:58.009 --> 00:13:58.019 align:start position:0%
all and law that you came up with last
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
session so thank you very much you're
 
00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:00.889 align:start position:0%
session so thank you very much you're
welcome

00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:00.899 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
and that's not under appeal right it is
 
00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
not okay I represented my first client
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
last Thursday congratulations thank you
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
um a question relative to
 
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
um the statement that's
 
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
written multiple times here rebuttable
 
00:14:16.139 --> 00:14:18.650 align:start position:0%
written multiple times here rebuttable
presumption

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
presumption
 
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
my understand my personal understanding
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
on reading legalese is that that gives
 
00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:25.019 align:start position:0%
would give the authority having
 
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction the judge the ability to
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
make a decision without having testimony
 
00:14:32.449 --> 00:14:32.459 align:start position:0%
from each one or both parties is that
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
correct or what's your guidance on that
 
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
no I would believe that they would have
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
testimony from both sides um in a full
 
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
evidentiary hearing both sides will be
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
able to provide their testimony and then
 
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
the judge would make a decision one way
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
or the other it doesn't mean that they
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
can't provide evidence or testimony it's
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
just that would be essentially the
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
default and then somebody and then if
 
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
there was evidence to the contrary and
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
the judge made findings would be able to
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
make a different determination okay
 
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:08.339 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman oh
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I missed where exactly the
 
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
your three points are in the bill could
 
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
you tell me where those are
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
okay so to the first point
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
um requiring um the parents to have
 
00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:36.610 align:start position:0%
um requiring um the parents to have
um

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:36.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
supervised visitation line 21
 
00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
of page one
 
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
section five after if after a full
 
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
is fine if I just okay
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
um the court order supervised the
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
visitation it shall order that such
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
visitation shall take place only at a
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
visitation center using a metal
 
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
detection device
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
it is also on page two
 
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh my second Point requiring a therapist
 
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
to essentially clear and clear is my
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
I think it was in another section as
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
well I'm just quickly looking
 
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.509 align:start position:0%
well I'm just quickly looking
foreign

00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
and then uh the piece about the
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
restraining order is on page four
 
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:00.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:06.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
and there are some repetitive sections
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
in the bill as well so this may be
 
00:17:10.679 --> 00:17:12.710 align:start position:0%
in the bill as well so this may be
repeated

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
repeated
 
00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:17.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your testimony
 
00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I appreciate your
 
00:17:23.939 --> 00:17:25.850 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I appreciate your
time

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
and by the way I took the practice LSAT
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
section on children and family law and
 
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
aced it so maybe we can go to law school
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Randall Collier
 
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
to come up and speak
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
please sir no you have you have now
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
three minutes we're into the
 
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
three-minute rule here and I enforce it
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
thank you committee and the chair my
 
00:17:57.529 --> 00:17:57.539 align:start position:0%
name is Randall Collier
 
00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
um I have a lot of problems with with
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.950 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.690 align:start position:0%
um
primarily

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
primarily
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
I have a lawsuit pending because of
 
00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
these statues
 
00:18:06.059 --> 00:18:06.710 align:start position:0%
these statues
um

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
and a lot of them don't make any sense
 
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
whereas it seems that the family court
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
judge it's an equity court and the only
 
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
the only way to actually take your
 
00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:18.020 align:start position:0%
rights away is to
 
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
be in a criminal court in a criminal
 
00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:24.419 align:start position:0%
proceeding with Jerry by appears and
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
three elements to a crime
 
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
um and to the ladies speaking about
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
um the evidence of being a victim of
 
00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:33.419 align:start position:0%
domestic violence you're right you know
 
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
it's hard to tell
 
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
um however
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
um you know when testimony contradicts
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
evidence and the judge goes with the you
 
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
know testimony it's hard for for someone
 
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
to rebut
 
00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:51.980 align:start position:0%
um being found under a criminal statue
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
but not actually in a criminal court so
 
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
there's obviously a conflict interest
 
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
using criminal statues uh not in a
 
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.390 align:start position:0%
using criminal statues uh not in a
criminal

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:11.220 align:start position:0%
next time you come back I owe you one
 
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
minute and 55 seconds extra thank you
 
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:15.539 align:start position:0%
sir that very succinct and much
 
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
appreciated and Dana Albrecht Mr
 
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:26.270 align:start position:0%
appreciated and Dana Albrecht Mr
Albrecht

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Dana Albrecht Nashua
 
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:32.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I have some exhibits you
 
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:34.940 align:start position:0%
can look at them later just in support
 
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
uh I'm strongly opposed to this bill is
 
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
written it relies on uh RSA 173b
 
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:47.220 align:start position:0%
uh which at this time I believe is an
 
00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:51.740 align:start position:0%
unmitigated disaster in practice
 
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
as actually implemented right now
 
00:19:59.450 --> 00:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
uh it's an Unholy obligation of civil
 
00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:03.419 align:start position:0%
and criminal law where the defendant has
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
is subject to all the penalties of
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
criminal law and none of the protections
 
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919 align:start position:0%
traditionally afforded a criminal
 
00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:12.169 align:start position:0%
traditionally afforded a criminal
defendant

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:12.179 align:start position:0%
defendant
 
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
in particular no right to an attorney
 
00:20:20.409 --> 00:20:20.419 align:start position:0%
uh RSA 173 B
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh right now is essentially used in two
 
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.070 align:start position:0%
uh right now is essentially used in two
capacities

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
capacities
 
00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:27.020 align:start position:0%
again in practice
 
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
uh one is to issue legitimate orders of
 
00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:33.419 align:start position:0%
protection that are badly needed
 
00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
uh and we hope the victims get those
 
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh and the other is that it is often
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
used by plaintiffs acting in extremely
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
poor Faith to gain the system
 
00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.110 align:start position:0%
poor Faith to gain the system
uh

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
to uh to that point of a gaming the
 
00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.690 align:start position:0%
to uh to that point of a gaming the
system

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:56.700 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
I have just two examples for you here
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
a number exhibit a is a pending court
 
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
case up at the New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.930 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
and from that we have a letter from the
 
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
defendant in jail
 
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
it may not uh go down in history like
 
00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
Gideon V Wainwright or Martin Luther
 
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
King's letter but it's definitely worth
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
reading I'd encourage you to do that
 
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
uh he's been there since December 20th
 
00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:39.059 align:start position:0%
and uh his position is all he's done
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
wrong is send a non-petroning test text
 
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
message about parenting to their child's
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
mother and he's still in jail for that
 
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
and you have one minute left
 
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.510 align:start position:0%
and you have one minute left
um

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
exhibit B we have a case where somebody
 
00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:57.980 align:start position:0%
wants to game the system
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
can uh we have a registered sex offender
 
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
here who went in as the plaintiff and
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
basically got
 
00:22:12.649 --> 00:22:12.659 align:start position:0%
judge Lemaire to
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
give him an order of protection
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
and not sure how that happened mistakes
 
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
were made
 
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
but she's given some great testimony
 
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
before this committee before so
 
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.169 align:start position:0%
before this committee before so
also

00:22:29.169 --> 00:22:29.179 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
gaming the system here so I would in
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
conclusion just suggest that we would
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
really need a complete overall of 173b
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
before even
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
going anywhere with a bill of this
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
nature thank you very much so much any

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and members of the
 
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
committee I just wanted to speak today
 
00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.049 align:start position:0%
committee I just wanted to speak today
quickly

00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:15.059 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
um because a lot of the things that you
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
guys are discussing in this bill I
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
really disagree with because just a
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
quick story here my ex tried to put a
 
00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:27.539 align:start position:0%
false police report on me so I could
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
lose my children he's still trying to
 
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
fight Soul custody with my children
 
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
and he will try to find any way possible
 
00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
to try to put a domestic violence not
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
only on me but he's constantly
 
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
constantly trying to go around the
 
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.570 align:start position:0%
constantly trying to go around the
system

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
to get sole responsibility of my
 
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
children and I have Primary Residential
 
00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:51.299 align:start position:0%
so passing this bill I just wanted to
 
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
say that it really should be
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
reconsidered and looking at some of the
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
the verbiage in here I just really
 
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
disagree with that's all thank you so
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
much any questions
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
Richard head that's Attorney Richard
 
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:18.649 --> 00:24:18.659 align:start position:0%

00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:29.990 align:start position:0%
okay Richard is fine too though thank
you

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Richard head I'm
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
the government Affairs coordinator for
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch I do want to just
 
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
point out some some aspects of this bill
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
that are problematic in terms of how
 
00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:45.059 align:start position:0%
they can be implemented
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
um some of it's definitional I won't go
 
00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:48.419 align:start position:0%
in into a lot of the details there's the
 
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
bill uses the term Family Violence
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not a specifically
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
defined term so if we take the
 
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
definition of family and the definition
 
00:25:00.169 --> 00:25:00.179 align:start position:0%
of violence within sort of the domestic
 
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
violence context it's a fairly broad
 
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
term I think although although not
 
00:25:06.649 --> 00:25:06.659 align:start position:0%
specifically defined so it would be
 
00:25:06.659 --> 00:25:07.669 align:start position:0%
specifically defined so it would be
subject

00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
subject
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
to some level of interpretation as to
 
00:25:12.169 --> 00:25:12.179 align:start position:0%
what is intended by Family Violence but
 
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:15.260 align:start position:0%
that may have some fairly broad scope
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
and then the implications as it flows
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
through this bill as you've already
 
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
heard and I won't repeat become very
 
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.649 align:start position:0%
heard and I won't repeat become very
broad

00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
broad
 
00:25:24.659 --> 00:25:25.730 align:start position:0%
broad
um

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:25.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
we agree with the with the point of uh
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
Aaron Justina regarding the the
 
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
um visitation centers he would become uh
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
sort of a functional
 
00:25:39.649 --> 00:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
um ban
 
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
um based on the fact that there's only
 
00:25:42.769 --> 00:25:42.779 align:start position:0%
one supervision Center that meets the
 
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
criteria uh in the state
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of the bill is it
 
00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
creates prohibitions based on Family
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
Violence but it doesn't give a time
 
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
frame so it doesn't say when the Family
 
00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
Violence may have may have occurred what
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances may have have related to
 
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.269 align:start position:0%
circumstances may have have related to
it

00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:06.059 align:start position:0%
um so there's there's no sort of
 
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
consideration in the bill for
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
um discretion with the with the court to
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
evaluate all the facts and circumstances
 
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
and to establish an order that that
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
meets the needs of an abused victim the
 
00:26:24.529 --> 00:26:24.539 align:start position:0%
children and the parents so
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
um the the phrasing of the bill is
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
frequently in the context of shall it
 
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
creates a an absolute mandate without
 
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.010 align:start position:0%
creates a an absolute mandate without
exceptions

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
um as and as an example of that on page
 
00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:40.220 align:start position:0%
two beginning at line 31
 
00:26:42.649 --> 00:26:42.659 align:start position:0%
talking about and determining parental
 
00:26:44.409 --> 00:26:44.419 align:start position:0%
rights and responsibilities
 
00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:47.700 align:start position:0%
created presumption that the presence of
 
00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:51.419 align:start position:0%
of child abuse under 169 C or domestic
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
violence creates a rebuttable
 
00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
presumption and it goes on
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
and again doesn't talk about time frame
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
or any attenuating circumstances or sort
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
of a a what is the nature of the balance
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
where where it becomes somewhat more
 
00:27:12.649 --> 00:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
problematic is in the uh going from page
 
00:27:15.649 --> 00:27:15.659 align:start position:0%
two line 36 if there are two instances
 
00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:18.299 align:start position:0%
of continued abuse in or around the
 
00:27:21.169 --> 00:27:21.179 align:start position:0%
exchange of the supervised visitation of
 
00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:22.340 align:start position:0%
the child
 
00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
under the statutes the court shall
 
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
suspend visitation altogether and again
 
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's a mandate without sort of an
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation of the of the of what's going
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
on and it's not clear
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
exactly as to how that would be
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
presented to the court the way it's
 
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.510 align:start position:0%
presented to the court the way it's
phrased

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
phrased
 
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.230 align:start position:0%
phrased
um

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
so there is because of the absolute
 
00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.769 align:start position:0%
so there is because of the absolute
mandate

00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
stated in here there is a risk as you
 
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
heard from some of the other testimony
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
about the statute becoming weaponized
 
00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
and and the
 
00:27:59.450 --> 00:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
um in in in the allegations there may be
 
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
an encouragement to create an allegation
 
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
um because the statute as written
 
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
creates a uh an absolute requirement of
 
00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:12.539 align:start position:0%
shall suspend in that then you know sort
 
00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:15.539 align:start position:0%
of becomes a process within within a
 
00:28:15.539 --> 00:28:17.269 align:start position:0%
of becomes a process within within a
case

00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
um my last uh
 
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
point is
 
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
um all right two more points I apologize
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
page two beginning at line one inserts a
 
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
new uh introduction to paragraph Roman
 
00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
one it is essentially the exact same
 
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
thing with with a statutory change as
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph three which would be deleted
 
00:28:39.649 --> 00:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
once you start moving paragraphs around
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
within a statute you then have a sort of
 
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
a carry along of every time a section is
 
00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.590 align:start position:0%
a carry along of every time a section is
referenced

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
referenced
 
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
that needs to follow along if we have a
 
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
form that references it that needs to
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
sort of get changed and it becomes sort
 
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
of an unnecessary complication when all
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
you're doing is changing a word within
 
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
the within the section my last point is
 
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
more or less an educational Point I've
 
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
made this point a lot last session I've
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
had to do it fewer times this session
 
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
is the effective date and it says 60
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
days after passage there's a statute
 
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
which I handed out
 
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:17.870 align:start position:0%
which I handed out
um

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
and you may hear me reference it
 
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
relative to other other bills RSA 14
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
colon 9-a is a statute that governs
 
00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:27.980 align:start position:0%
effective dates it has a very specific
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
requirement relative to anything that
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
affects judicial processes essentially
 
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
um and it says that they shall become
 
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
effective on January 1 on the January 1
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
following passage and that's under RSA
 
00:29:47.409 --> 00:29:47.419 align:start position:0%
14 colon 9-a paragraph Roman 2 small a
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
so any of these bills that impact the
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
judicial branch that have an effective
 
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
date other than January 1 we just ask
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
that those get changed with that I would
 
00:29:57.289 --> 00:29:57.299 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony I'd be happy to
 
00:29:59.930 --> 00:29:59.940 align:start position:0%

00:30:03.649 --> 00:30:03.659 align:start position:0%

I was going to say pardon the French but
 
00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:28.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
three months in Germany okay yeah no not
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%

members of the committee my name is

Pamela kylig and I am the public policy
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
specialist at the New Hampshire
 
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:44.220 align:start position:0%
Coalition against Domestic and Sexual
 
00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.470 align:start position:0%
Coalition against Domestic and Sexual
Violence

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
Violence
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
um the Coalition as some of you might
 
00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
know is the umbrella Organization for 12
 
00:30:51.289 --> 00:30:51.299 align:start position:0%
community-based crisis centers who
 
00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
provide free and confidential services
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
to nearly 15 000 survivors of sexual and
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
domestic violence annually I'm here to
 
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
speak and I'll keep it brief because I
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
Echo the concern shared by attorney head
 
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
and Aaron Jacina we oppose the bill as
 
00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
written and because of the significant
 
00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:10.980 align:start position:0%
changes it would make to the statute
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
um we really appreciate the sponsors
 
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
sponsors efforts to recognize the
 
00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
importance of protecting victims and
 
00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
their children when determining parental
 
00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
rights and responsibilities in domestic
 
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
violence cases however
 
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
um while there are some positive things
 
00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
that could come from this legislation we
 
00:31:29.149 --> 00:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
are really concerned about some
 
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
significant unintended consequences that
 
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
could come that could be at the
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
detriment of victims and their children
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
and we find it really important to
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
strike the right balance in the law so
 
00:31:42.049 --> 00:31:42.059 align:start position:0%
we would just ask the committee to
 
00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:45.059 align:start position:0%
consider at the very least allowing us
 
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
to further study what changes could be
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
made if there are any to ensure that the
 
00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
appropriate protections are in place but
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
at this time we find the bill in
 
00:31:57.049 --> 00:31:57.059 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and would like
 
00:31:59.210 --> 00:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
you to consider that as well
 
00:32:00.889 --> 00:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
will you take questions
 
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
um absolutely thank you any questions
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
did the sponsor consult with you
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
um no okay thank you
 
00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
and that concludes the uh hearing the
 
00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:16.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
with the approval of ranking member I
 
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on Bill 547 and now
 
00:32:33.409 --> 00:32:33.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
while we have the last handout coming
 
00:32:36.720 --> 00:33:01.490 align:start position:0%
while we have the last handout coming
around

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:15.169 --> 00:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
okay folks before I'm ready to entertain
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
a motion just anybody's thoughts on the
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
build before us anybody wanna
 
00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:27.889 --> 00:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
I think representative Bickford does
 
00:33:27.899 --> 00:33:30.110 align:start position:0%
I think representative Bickford does
okay

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
um he's getting ready
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
language that they're working with here
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
this language that we put together in
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
2005 from the family law task force and
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
they're looking to be looked at to amend
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
that and I have to agree I'm I'm not
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
favorable to it after
 
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
just reading it uh you may be going too
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
far and yeah it sure will weaponize
 
00:33:53.039 --> 00:33:54.470 align:start position:0%
far and yeah it sure will weaponize
things

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.130 align:start position:0%
things
um

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
that's my estimation I didn't hear
 
00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
anything about the guardian lighting
 
00:33:59.870 --> 00:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
list I
 
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
was sort of interested in how that might
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh play out
 
00:34:04.559 --> 00:34:05.630 align:start position:0%
uh play out
um

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:05.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
I I do wish we could exec it a different
 
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
time because
 
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:11.210 align:start position:0%
time because
um

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
people write in up till noon time
 
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
to send us information on these things
 
00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:18.419 align:start position:0%
and we're not getting the opportunity to
 
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
look at those things that's my little
 
00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:21.409 align:start position:0%
look at those things that's my little
protest

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:21.419 align:start position:0%
protest
 
00:34:21.419 --> 00:34:22.970 align:start position:0%
protest
okay

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:25.849 --> 00:34:25.859 align:start position:0%
anyone else any thoughts about the bill
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
I hear from other committee chairs that
 
00:34:39.970 --> 00:34:39.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
well my thoughts there was no
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
consultation with either the executive
 
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
department or judicial Department
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
relative to the bill
 
00:34:59.810 --> 00:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
there were no co-sponsors so it hasn't
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
seemingly been hashed out with other
 
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
legislators willing to put their name on
 
00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:04.970 align:start position:0%
legislators willing to put their name on
it

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
there's no documentation of what other
 
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
states do
 
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
sponsor even is not present besides
 
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
being noticed in the calendar I sent out
 
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
an email to ahead of the calendar to
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
people letting them know when their bill
 
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
will be heard
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
I think it's not just one but maybe two
 
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
bridges too far there's good stuff in it
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
and even everyone who spoke here
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
thoughts so uh this is the kind of uh
 
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
situation where I'm very tempted to say
 
00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
let's sit on this for a bit and rewrite
 
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
it except this is an early bill and it's
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
got to get out the door fairly quickly I
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
don't think there's time to rewrite an
 
00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
amendment big enough
 
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
to consult with everybody and get the
 
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
research and and Deuce the things that
 
00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:55.140 align:start position:0%
would make us have a good uh possible
 
00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
Amendment and if it's big enough it
 
00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
might be arguably in part non-germaine
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
which means the speaker has to rule on
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
it and so on so we have a clock issue as
 
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.150 align:start position:0%
it and so on so we have a clock issue as
well

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:08.870 align:start position:0%
well
um

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
I would entertain
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
um I would entertain a motion I think
 
00:36:14.569 --> 00:36:14.579 align:start position:0%
you know where I'm going I can make the
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
motion I'd rather not would somebody
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:22.820 align:start position:0%
can we make a motion to Ito
 
00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:27.500 align:start position:0%
representative Levesque I saw your hand
 
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:29.940 align:start position:0%

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:32.760 align:start position:0%

00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
Perez said I was going to make a motion
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
to ITF all right we have a motion from
 
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton
 
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
to itl do I hear a second
 
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:49.140 align:start position:0%

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
Greg excuse me chair chairman I was the
 
00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
one who made the motion to Ito you did

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:00.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
like I I had my hand and I say can we
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
don't hear Spanish quite as well but I'm
 
00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:10.619 align:start position:0%
working on it as you know I can roll my
 
00:37:13.849 --> 00:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
Arts that's okay okay so that was
 
00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
representative Perez I misread where
 
00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
your finger was pointing I apologize for
 
00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.089 align:start position:0%
your finger was pointing I apologize for
that

00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:20.099 align:start position:0%

has the policy changed about starting
 
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:37.380 align:start position:0%

00:48:47.089 --> 00:48:47.099 align:start position:0%
to be served there has to be process
 
00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:49.740 align:start position:0%
um frequently you see
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
um uh dates from Return of service for
 
00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:55.140 align:start position:0%
example so that all the parties now have
 
00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
noticed that they uh that there's a
 
00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
proceeding and that a hearing is going
 
00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
to be scheduled
 
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
the the time frames are not necessarily
 
00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
cons so this relates to temporary orders
 
00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
um and talks about the after filing of a
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
petition concerning a minor child the
 
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
court and then it says shall issue
 
00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
orders instead of a May taking away that
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
discretion from the court with such
 
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
conditions and limitations it's not
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
consistent with some of the other
 
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
Provisions within RSA 461a such as 461 a
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
colon 9 which talks about ex parte
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
temporary orders requires a hearing
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
within five days so that does fit
 
00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:38.339 align:start position:0%
however it's only if there is a specific
 
00:49:40.609 --> 00:49:40.619 align:start position:0%
request for a hearing ultimately there
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
may not be a request for a hearing this
 
00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
bill would mandate a hearing where the
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
parties do not actually necessarily want
 
00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
one or have not requested one
 
00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:53.300 align:start position:0%
um it's also inconsistent with
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
461-8 colon 9. um which talks about 30
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
actually not necessarily inconsistent
 
00:50:02.089 --> 00:50:02.099 align:start position:0%
but that's an example of of where we
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
have 30 days from service
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
we do have concerns generally about
 
00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
bills there are a number of bills this
 
00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
session that impose mandatory deadlines
 
00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
on the court for hearings we have
 
00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
one of our most valuable assets is our
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
docket we have a docket that every judge
 
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
has it cannot be longer than seven and a
 
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
half hours while the court is open and
 
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
they get filled and we're talking about
 
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
circuit court so we're talking about
 
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
Family Division cases and District
 
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
division cases and they fill a docket
 
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:43.140 align:start position:0%
and they're as we add more and more
 
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
mandatory hearings into our docket
 
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
that creates fewer openings for all of
 
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
the cases that don't have a strict
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory deadline and there are a large
 
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
number of of statutory constitutional
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
Provisions that set requirements so that
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
then ends up creating just significant
 
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
operational limitations from for courts
 
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
Court staff and the judges to implement
 
00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
or or to put together a daily docket
 
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
so we do have significant concerns about
 
00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:20.780 align:start position:0%
any time we we start putting in
 
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
mandatory 30-day 45-day deadlines and
 
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
without sort of exceptions if the
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
parties ask for more time it's not
 
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
allowed for in here if the parties
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
um have some sort of have a have a
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
mutual agreement they don't need
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
hearings that's not accounted for
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
hearing in this in this process so
 
00:51:44.569 --> 00:51:44.579 align:start position:0%
there's just a a lot of
 
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
things that have Ripple effects in the
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
system that have not been contemplated
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
in this bill and we think that just in
 
00:51:52.849 --> 00:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
and of itself creates some some
 
00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
significant operational problems for the
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
from the Court's perspective with that
 
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
I'll conclude my comments but would be
 
00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thank you
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
attorney head for taking my question and
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
to Mr chairman for noticing my lien
 
00:52:20.569 --> 00:52:20.579 align:start position:0%
trying to get around the corner here my
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
question is regarding
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
um situations where
 
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:29.220 align:start position:0%
um service is not happening so where a
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
party has filed in court and then
 
00:52:35.569 --> 00:52:35.579 align:start position:0%
um they've attempted to uh serve the
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
other party and it it doesn't work what
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
typically happens then and would this
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
bill make any changes to that because as
 
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
I was reading it I was thinking that
 
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
might be where this person was trying to
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
go with the bill
 
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:50.220 align:start position:0%
um so I don't read it that it would make
 
00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:51.170 align:start position:0%
um so I don't read it that it would make
changes

00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
um to the service aspect of of so
 
00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
problematic service where person has
 
00:52:56.569 --> 00:52:56.579 align:start position:0%
moved we don't know where they are
 
00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
necessarily or whatever maybe limiting
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
service it would be a request to the
 
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
court for alternative service so
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
publication something else
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
um but there there would be sort of a
 
00:53:08.809 --> 00:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
process that would go before the judge
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
just asking for alternate native service
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
and and and I apologize to take another
 
00:53:17.049 --> 00:53:17.059 align:start position:0%
Point anytime the courts receive
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
requests for temporary orders they are
 
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
evaluated in terms of is there an
 
00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
emergency situation is there a
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
circumstance where speed is appropriate
 
00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the factors the court
 
00:53:32.569 --> 00:53:32.579 align:start position:0%
would take into account so if there's a
 
00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
Need for Speed the court will will
 
00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:36.900 align:start position:0%
schedule stuff quickly
 
00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
um and and if the need is there in less
 
00:53:41.089 --> 00:53:41.099 align:start position:0%
than 30 days so I'm not saying that
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
these are not important
 
00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
orders but the the sort of strict
 
00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
deadlines without consideration of the
 
00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:50.660 align:start position:0%
consequence of the of the circumstances
 
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
creates sort of an unnecessary burden
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
um anytime we're dealing with temporary
 
00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
orders those tend to be sort of the
 
00:53:59.690 --> 00:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
higher priority
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
um types of requests within the system
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
but they don't all need necessarily to
 
00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
I'm just reading ahead in the 461
 
00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
section here and it looks like it
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
expands on what you're saying is if
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
speed is necessary speed is possible
 
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
speed is absolutely possible and I I
 
00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
should have just started with that I
 
00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
have it in my mind it's just implied and
 
00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
I forget to vocalize things sometimes
 
00:54:33.049 --> 00:54:33.059 align:start position:0%
but there is language already about
 
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
exercising you know appropriate speed
 
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
and it is it is no you know the clerks
 
00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:41.579 align:start position:0%
do that when they receive these these
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
types of of requests so it's it's built
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
into the system already
 
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
um it but but the lack of discretion
 
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
either by the parties or the court sort
 
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
of creates unnecessary limitations and
 
00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:54.410 align:start position:0%
of creates unnecessary limitations and
burdens

00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
burdens
 
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
I think you'll understand we Face much
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
the same thing in scheduling and moving
 
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
bills through absolutely absolutely
 
00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you and the
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Vivian Gerard she says
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
she wants to speak for one minute in
 
00:55:14.329 --> 00:55:14.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chair members of the admittee
 
00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
um I have to strongly agree with um
 
00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
Richard head on this one because when
 
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
you're throwing a 30-day limit in the
 
00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
court systems as we all know speed does
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
not equal Court
 
00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
um if a judge is supposed to be getting
 
00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
an order out in 30 days we can't even
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
get that out of them so how are they
 
00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
going to come up with a 30-day window on
 
00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:38.839 align:start position:0%
a temporary
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
hearing and all those other cases like
 
00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
myself I've been in the court system for
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
nine years so that just keeps bumping
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
other cases like mine where you don't
 
00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
get an answer and the only people that
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
suffer is the family and the children
 
00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:57.650 --> 00:55:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.349 --> 00:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much and Mr
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
Randall Collier welcome back
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
representing yourself in opposition to
 
00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:11.569 --> 00:56:11.579 align:start position:0%
thank you committee and the chair and
 
00:56:15.049 --> 00:56:15.059 align:start position:0%
let me uh speak in opposing this bill uh
 
00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
461 A8 uh just kind of curious I agree
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
with the uh other speakers uh regarding
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
the time frames
 
00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
um if anyone's ever been on the other
 
00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
side of this uh waiting 30 days or even
 
00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
45 days or
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
any amount of time to be without your
 
00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.530 align:start position:0%
any amount of time to be without your
kid

00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
kid
 
00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:37.140 align:start position:0%
um is detrimental to their well-being as
 
00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
well as the parent
 
00:56:38.819 --> 00:56:39.710 align:start position:0%
well as the parent
um

00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
understanding it says the orders may be
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
issued ex parte I'm kind of confused how
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
the due process and the evidence to
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
defend if if it's an ex parte in one
 
00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
party is not there to represent and
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
defend themselves
 
00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
seems unconstitutional to put that in
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
um we've we could take a continuing
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
education moment to could we explain
 
00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
your question his question about ex
 
00:57:14.329 --> 00:57:14.339 align:start position:0%
parte and some of those little nuances
 
00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
of law
 
00:57:17.329 --> 00:57:17.339 align:start position:0%
and thank you thank you for raising that
 
00:57:17.339 --> 00:57:23.030 align:start position:0%
and thank you thank you for raising that
point

00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman just and I'll
 
00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
talk generally about ex parte requests
 
00:57:29.809 --> 00:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
um next parte request is typically filed
 
00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
with a court where
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
um circumstances may be so urgent that
 
00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:36.780 align:start position:0%
there's insufficient time to bring the
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
other party into the uh into the court
 
00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
to provide them notice opportunity to be
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
heard but circumstances are such that on
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
that day a party is looking for some
 
00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:51.180 align:start position:0%
sort of uh relief from the court whether
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
it be protection whether whatever it may
 
00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:54.970 align:start position:0%
it be protection whether whatever it may
be

00:57:54.970 --> 00:57:54.980 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
it may be relative to access to Children
 
00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
you know broad scope of potential issues
 
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
that may appear before the before the
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
court on a ex-bar team meaning no notice
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
to the other side and the court would
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
review that particular request they may
 
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
or may not ask him for more information
 
00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:17.220 align:start position:0%
if the pleading is insufficient and in
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
order would get issued and if the order
 
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
is to Grant the motion for ex parte
 
00:58:23.809 --> 00:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
relief the court also then would be
 
00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:25.980 align:start position:0%
scheduling a hearing typically within
 
00:58:28.609 --> 00:58:28.619 align:start position:0%
five days to allow for the party to get
 
00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
notice it may be even shorter and an
 
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come in and provide
 
00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:37.140 align:start position:0%
their version their view of of the facts
 
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
and circumstances and then the court
 
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
would reevaluate its ex parte order now
 
00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
that's had an opportunity to hear from
 
00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
from all the parties it may or may not
 
00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
issue a a new modified or or withdraw
 
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
the order depending on the additional
 
00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
facts that it may learn
 
00:58:57.650 --> 00:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
ex parte simply meaning by the part one
 
00:58:59.450 --> 00:58:59.460 align:start position:0%
party is present the other is not
 
00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:01.140 align:start position:0%
exactly I mean it's just the filing
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
party the other party may not even know
 
00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
that that there's a request filed at
 
00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
that point
 
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
good any further questions during our
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
continuing education session Vice
 
00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
chairman long
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I mean we we do
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
get numbers on parenting petitions and
 
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:19.740 align:start position:0%
all that I I'm wondering if there is
 
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
there a number of how many of these EX
 
00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
parte's with no notice
 
00:59:28.849 --> 00:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
uh in a qualification that it is five
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
days and it's not 10 or 20. it is five
 
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
days it is at least so so it depends on
 
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
the statute so if we're talking about
 
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
under 461a it's five days okay so so
 
00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
just the number of how many of these
 
00:59:43.849 --> 00:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
under 461. where there's no notice I
 
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
will check if we if we if it pops out of
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
if we can extract it and I'll send an
 
00:59:50.089 --> 00:59:50.099 align:start position:0%
email to the committee thank you
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh stipulating that the prime sponsor
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
may have a point
 
00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:55.849 align:start position:0%
may have a point
um

00:59:55.849 --> 00:59:55.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
and also stipulating that the difficulty
 
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
is as you had said what is a possible
 
01:00:05.089 --> 01:00:05.099 align:start position:0%
Third Way
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
to see what would we need to do to honor
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
the speed that is requested in the bill
 
01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:15.380 align:start position:0%
and yet make it possible without
 
01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
inconveniencing others as Mr Rod pointed
 
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
out is there a possible remedy down the
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
road in your opinion so I guess I I'm
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
unsure as to whether there's a problem
 
01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
in the first place
 
01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:30.839 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know of I'm not sure what
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
the problem is we're trying to address
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
in order to put language in that that
 
01:00:37.849 --> 01:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
fixes it because I think as appropriate
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
we are scheduling hearings quickly there
 
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
you know to the extent there are delays
 
01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:45.660 align:start position:0%
it tends to be because
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
the docket day seven and a half hours
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
for that judge is just full and we're
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
trying to put it in
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
um if it needs to be we will
 
01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
there some parties May view theirs as
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
needing and in fact you know 40 days may
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
be sufficient or nobody's requested
 
01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
anything we don't need to and the
 
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
parties have an agreement
 
01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
we don't want to hold a hearing fill up
 
01:01:09.049 --> 01:01:09.059 align:start position:0%
a docket time when all of the parties
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
have filed a stipulation of agreement
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
um so I I you know
 
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
I don't so I to your question I don't
 
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
know what the exact problem is we're
 
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
trying to address in terms of of
 
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
scenarios that could then translate into
 
01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
policy language
 
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:28.609 --> 01:01:28.619 align:start position:0%
and thank you for our continuing ed
 
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
session thank you and I think we may
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
need a few more in the course of the day
 
01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
to fill up the time we're here and uh
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
make some notes and let's see what we
 
01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:39.299 align:start position:0%
can do
 
01:01:42.289 --> 01:01:42.299 align:start position:0%
you got it chair recognizes Dana
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
Albrecht he asked for one minute he is
 
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill
 
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
maybe this can answer part of our
 
01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.049 align:start position:0%
maybe this can answer part of our
question

01:01:51.049 --> 01:01:51.059 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
how about I say I Dana Albright for the
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
record how about if I say I'm in strong
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
support of the bill with appropriate
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
language cleanup to address a lot of the
 
01:02:00.839 --> 01:02:02.329 align:start position:0%
language cleanup to address a lot of the
concerns

01:02:02.329 --> 01:02:02.339 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:02:04.849 --> 01:02:04.859 align:start position:0%
uh by case has dragged on for six and a
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
half years I currently have an appeal
 
01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.490 align:start position:0%
half years I currently have an appeal
docket

01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:09.500 align:start position:0%
docket
 
01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
2022-0517 raising claims of
 
01:02:13.849 --> 01:02:13.859 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional delay
 
01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
over going over two and a half years
 
01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
without getting a hearing on a simple
 
01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
motion for enforcement
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
most parents don't have the luxury of
 
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
kind of doing that though so I think we
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
really do need to get into statute
 
01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:33.059 align:start position:0%
some kind of
 
01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
language to implement uh reasonable time
 
01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
frames to get uh parenting petitions
 
01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:41.390 align:start position:0%
frames to get uh parenting petitions
done

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:45.299 align:start position:0%
uh in particular I point out that uh all
 
01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
DV requests actually happen ex parte
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
with no notice and have to be heard
 
01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:53.900 align:start position:0%
within 30 days
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
and if we're doing DB petitions
 
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
why can't we do something similar for
 
01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:02.650 align:start position:0%
why can't we do something similar for
parenting

01:03:02.650 --> 01:03:02.660 align:start position:0%
parenting
 
01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:04.309 align:start position:0%
parenting
and

01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:06.299 align:start position:0%
at the moment that creates even a bigger
 
01:03:09.309 --> 01:03:09.319 align:start position:0%
problem because as mentioned earlier
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
certain unsavory plaintiffs might wish
 
01:03:15.049 --> 01:03:15.059 align:start position:0%
to use the DV mechanism
 
01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:19.079 align:start position:0%
to kind of do an end run around all of
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
this and
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
get some of the things that this bill I
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
believe is meant to have happened the
 
01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
right way and they get to do that the
 
01:03:32.089 --> 01:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
wrong way and that's about all I'll say
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
seeing hearing none thank you so much
 
01:03:42.289 --> 01:03:42.299 align:start position:0%
and I just under the wire another pink
 
01:03:43.690 --> 01:03:43.700 align:start position:0%
card you
 
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
could you recognize me just briefly get
 
01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
rid of the ex parte language thank you
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:01.730 --> 01:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
I was reading I was reading exactly this
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chairman and and Aaron
 
01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
Justina uh Justina corrected me and
 
01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
she's absolutely right so what I testify
 
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
two is it's five days for
 
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
um ex parte it's five days if requested
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
30 days if the request is not received
 
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
so my mistake and I apologize for that
 
01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
that's 461 A9 Roman free and following
 
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
that's correct I think that's right but
 
01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:35.579 align:start position:0%
well I have the book so I haven't I
 
01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
don't have it in front of me so that's
 
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
correct I'll I'll rely on that but so I
 
01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
apologize for the error
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:56.589 --> 01:04:56.599 align:start position:0%
this closes the hearing on House Bill
 
01:05:00.289 --> 01:05:00.299 align:start position:0%
600 and I now open the exact session
 
01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:04.140 align:start position:0%
with the agreement of the ranking member
 
01:05:08.089 --> 01:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.609 --> 01:05:10.619 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have a little sense of the
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
meeting discussion before I receive a
 
01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
motion so
 
01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:16.130 align:start position:0%
motion so
um

01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:16.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
I'd like to speak
 
01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton thank you Mr
 
01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
chairman I do agree with the first
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
person that spoke I forget
 
01:05:31.849 --> 01:05:31.859 align:start position:0%
who I forget what his name was but
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
regarding that there's there's
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
other deadlines like the person needs to
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
be served and you don't necessarily know
 
01:05:42.289 --> 01:05:42.299 align:start position:0%
what the parenting plan needs to say
 
01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
until the time has elapsed and you've
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
fleshed out some of the issues
 
01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:49.370 align:start position:0%
fleshed out some of the issues
um

01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
you do need that time so these short
 
01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
time frames while they might provide
 
01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
some level of benefit it might end up in
 
01:05:57.890 --> 01:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
incomplete temporary parenting orders
 
01:05:59.809 --> 01:05:59.819 align:start position:0%
and that might end up elongating the
 
01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
process in the long run
 
01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:05.700 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else wish to speak
 
01:06:09.309 --> 01:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
on the committee so
 
01:06:15.010 --> 01:06:15.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:22.210 align:start position:0%
three that has been referenced in this
uh

01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:22.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
469- a colon 9 sub-roman III if
 
01:06:30.289 --> 01:06:30.299 align:start position:0%
temporary orders are made ex parte the
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
party against whom the orders are issued
 
01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
May file a written request with the
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
clerk of the court and request a hearing
 
01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
thereon such a hearing shall be held no
 
01:06:44.089 --> 01:06:44.099 align:start position:0%
later than five days after the request
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
is received by the clerk
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman may I speak you on
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
one condition is that you turn on your
 
01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:58.970 --> 01:06:58.980 align:start position:0%
you're welcome sometimes I use my mama
 
01:07:03.049 --> 01:07:03.059 align:start position:0%
voice and don't think I need one anyway
 
01:07:05.289 --> 01:07:05.299 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
46983 blah blah it already answers to
 
01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:10.910 align:start position:0%
46983 blah blah it already answers to
this

01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%

okay thank you
 
01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:37.140 align:start position:0%

01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:39.529 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:07:39.529 --> 01:07:39.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
these bills that we have today uh seem
 
01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
to be entering into the realm of the
 
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
machinations of the court of which I
 
01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
don't really know the details of how the
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
court needs to file etc etc and I would
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
before I could
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
pass these I would want to have a
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
minimum subcommittee to help me
 
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
understand like you need somebody from
 
01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:02.930 align:start position:0%
understand like you need somebody from
judiciary

01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
judiciary
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
augment or help understand
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
the problem that we're trying to solve
 
01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
so one of the Motions that we may
 
01:08:20.209 --> 01:08:20.219 align:start position:0%
consider is the motion to retain which
 
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
means we hold on to this
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh individuals may meet I may appoint a
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and in the fall we come
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
back and consider based on that group of
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
people's work I hope in consultation
 
01:08:39.169 --> 01:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
with the Judiciary so retain is a motion
 
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
we don't have to pass it we don't have
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
to kill it we can keep it so just for
 
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:46.799 align:start position:0%
when it's time to make a motion that
 
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
would that speak to what you just said I
 
01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
think so it is also in terms study you
 
01:08:54.289 --> 01:08:54.299 align:start position:0%
want to retain that would be a
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittees thing it could be I've
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
kind of forgotten the
 
01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
the various ways well it kind of yeah
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
yeah anyway I'm stuck with that I
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
I just don't know enough about the
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
system to be able to make an intelligent
 
01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
decision on this
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
I might suggest to those of you
 
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
considering writing bills for next time
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
you do that work up front there's a lot
 
01:09:20.809 --> 01:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
of prep work before you start to see the
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
grounds floor of a skyscraper they go
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
down several floors to build the
 
01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
foundations that's the foundation of
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
good bill writing is to check with the
 
01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:31.259 align:start position:0%
people who know to ask the questions
 
01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
that need to be asked to have them give
 
01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
information we didn't know how to ask
 
01:09:38.809 --> 01:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
but given that that may not have
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
happened here I don't know
 
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
we can keep it ourselves and do that
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
yes representative Vice chairman long
 
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
um with respect to retaining
 
01:10:00.169 --> 01:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
I mean it's difficult to know what the
 
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
intent is when you don't when the
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor is not giving you what the
 
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
intent is it may be a good intent I
 
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
don't know what it is but we have to
 
01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
remember that if we retain this
 
01:10:13.729 --> 01:10:13.739 align:start position:0%
this becomes our bill it is our bill now
 
01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
sir we do and we do what we want with it
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
and you know is that what we want to do
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
as a committee start taking bills and
 
01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
sort of twisting and turning them as to
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
where we think they ought to be going so
 
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:30.830 align:start position:0%
where we think they ought to be going so
um

01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:32.689 --> 01:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
you know as the chairman mentioned that
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
you know there is a due diligence
 
01:10:37.729 --> 01:10:37.739 align:start position:0%
process that gives us the information
 
01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
and even if we were to retain it I don't
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
even know what the intent of the bill is
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
so where would I stocked
 
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
um so what's that if I'm not mistaken
 
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
once the bill has been assigned to this
 
01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
committee it is no longer the sponsor's
 
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
bill it is our bill
 
01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
so we can do with it as we wish we can
 
01:10:59.209 --> 01:10:59.219 align:start position:0%
change it as we wish this is a platform
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
for our going somewhere and we really
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily need to know what the
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor's intent and we can ask we don't
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
have to we can take it and make it
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
something should we choose to
 
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
and that's a little work group and it
 
01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
reports back when we come back in
 
01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
September October and then we decide
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
what to do and on it goes on its merry
 
01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
way till next year
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:11:30.770 --> 01:11:30.780 align:start position:0%
any thoughts anybody wish to make let me
 
01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
ask you this before we do it because
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
it's easier to do it when we're not
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
doing it officially
 
01:11:36.719 --> 01:11:37.910 align:start position:0%
doing it officially
um

01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
how does the idea of retain and work on
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
it strike you this is not an official
 
01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
I don't see hands
 
01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
do I see hands for retaining
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
okay do I see hands for passing the bill
 
01:12:03.169 --> 01:12:03.179 align:start position:0%

01:34:43.729 --> 01:34:43.739 align:start position:0%
you do not say in your pink card whether
 
01:34:50.209 --> 01:34:50.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.530 --> 01:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
turn your mic on oh thank you
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
forgive me uh Dana Albrecht I believe
 
01:35:00.050 --> 01:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill like the one we
 
01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
just heard or one of the intents is to
 
01:35:05.209 --> 01:35:05.219 align:start position:0%
ensure that things that need to happen
 
01:35:08.209 --> 01:35:08.219 align:start position:0%
in Family Court proceedings happen in a
 
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
timely fashion and I think that that
 
01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:13.250 align:start position:0%
timely fashion and I think that that
intent

01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
is a extremely laudable goal and I think
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's something that the committee
 
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
should try to do right now we have a
 
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of DVS that are handled
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
in an ex parte fashion no notice to the
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
other party while other stuff can
 
01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
languish on the docket so I just
 
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to vote at a
 
01:35:35.450 --> 01:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
minimum to retain something
 
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh is a vehicle just to make sure we get
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
things done in family court in a timely
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
fashion uh and that's all I have on this
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
unless there's questions
 
01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
and she says three slash four I'm going
 
01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
to say that's three to four minutes not
 
01:36:09.649 --> 01:36:09.659 align:start position:0%
45 seconds three or four minutes correct
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
got it
 
01:36:12.290 --> 01:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and members of the
 
01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:13.189 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and members of the
committee

01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
um so this one actually has a very
 
01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:18.110 align:start position:0%
um so this one actually has a very
strong

01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
strong
 
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
it leaves it leaves a strong effect here
 
01:36:24.110 --> 01:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
because if you're allowing people to do
 
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
non-payment for child support filed by
 
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
the other parent what happens when you
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
have a parent that intentionally
 
01:36:37.850 --> 01:36:37.860 align:start position:0%
short pays the child support arrears
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
every month so for instance if I brought
 
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
my ex in there because child support
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
hasn't been taken out the full amount
 
01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
and he just kind of pays what he wants
 
01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
when he feels like it
 
01:36:50.890 --> 01:36:50.900 align:start position:0%
um I I don't understand
 
01:36:55.129 --> 01:36:55.139 align:start position:0%
how that really can play into effect and
 
01:36:57.410 --> 01:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
as far as being able to go
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
schedule like a mediation
 
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
these arrears should not be up for
 
01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
debate what they owe they owe
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
and I noticed in the past because of my
 
01:37:12.770 --> 01:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
own case a lot of these
 
01:37:14.570 --> 01:37:14.580 align:start position:0%
um arrears
 
01:37:17.209 --> 01:37:17.219 align:start position:0%
once they go up for appeals they
 
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
actually disappear
 
01:37:21.050 --> 01:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
again something else that I don't
 
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
understand so if somebody has all these
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
Escape goats all the way around to get
 
01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
away from paying their child support
 
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
especially when somebody makes a hundred
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
and fifty thousand dollars a year and
 
01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
he's taken extravagant vacations and
 
01:37:38.930 --> 01:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
buying extravagant property
 
01:37:40.970 --> 01:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
I mean this actually does cause a very
 
01:37:43.250 --> 01:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
big strain on children
 
01:37:47.209 --> 01:37:47.219 align:start position:0%
so having the your numbers for arrears
 
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
being mediated
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
um it just doesn't seem like that makes
 
01:37:52.669 --> 01:37:52.679 align:start position:0%
sense I mean that's going to be
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
um violating some kind of federal law
 
01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:57.179 align:start position:0%
here for the child support
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
um I I was looking at the um the RSA 461
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
A14 that you're referencing here but it
 
01:38:05.689 --> 01:38:05.699 align:start position:0%
seems like
 
01:38:10.490 --> 01:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
so why should it get mediated if
 
01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
somebody willfully does not want to pay
 
01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
their child support payments and why is
 
01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
people not being held accountable so if
 
01:38:24.110 --> 01:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
you have working class people that are
 
01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
making a true
 
01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
um effort to pay their child support
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
why are they being held to the highest
 
01:38:37.129 --> 01:38:37.139 align:start position:0%
standard when you have a white collar
 
01:38:39.290 --> 01:38:39.300 align:start position:0%
person like my ex
 
01:38:42.649 --> 01:38:42.659 align:start position:0%
um that he has no ramifications for not
 
01:38:44.689 --> 01:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
pain and support
 
01:38:48.410 --> 01:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
so here we are now looking at former
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
judge intercasso she owes the the state
 
01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
seventy eight thousand dollars in her in
 
01:38:57.530 --> 01:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
her settlement nobody's holding her
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
accountable for her debts that is still
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
a state debt so why are all these
 
01:39:07.729 --> 01:39:07.739 align:start position:0%
um a rear is just getting forgiven and
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
just kind of getting pushed off the
 
01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:10.910 align:start position:0%
just kind of getting pushed off the
books

01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
books
 
01:39:13.729 --> 01:39:13.739 align:start position:0%
my ex is the only person I've ever met
 
01:39:16.729 --> 01:39:16.739 align:start position:0%
that the arrears go away
 
01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
and and this is a true problem here we
 
01:39:23.689 --> 01:39:23.699 align:start position:0%
are struggling to support the family and
 
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
somebody just can walk over and mediate
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
their arrears
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
from what I understand arrears should
 
01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
never go away
 
01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
um I do have uh some handouts that I'd
 
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
like to give to you guys because I I
 
01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:41.159 align:start position:0%
strongly believe that numbers speak a
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
thousand words and where you're looking
 
01:39:46.490 --> 01:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
at two different income class people and
 
01:39:48.410 --> 01:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
looking at the arrears and their form of
 
01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
payments I think that this will really
 
01:39:53.149 --> 01:39:53.159 align:start position:0%
give you an eye-opener of what the child
 
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
support Bureau does and one of the
 
01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:57.229 align:start position:0%
support Bureau does and one of the
concerns

01:39:57.229 --> 01:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:40:00.410 --> 01:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
um somewhat unrelated to this bill is
 
01:40:02.209 --> 01:40:02.219 align:start position:0%
the fact that why are they not
 
01:40:04.910 --> 01:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
collecting based on the the court orders
 
01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
why are they collecting what they feel
 
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
like and not following the court orders
 
01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
and why all those arrears
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
not being calculated properly so I do I
 
01:40:18.649 --> 01:40:18.659 align:start position:0%
do want to pass this out and I I would
 
01:40:20.810 --> 01:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
like to find out how
 
01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:22.860 align:start position:0%
multiple people are not being treated
 
01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:25.070 align:start position:0%
multiple people are not being treated
equally

01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
equally
 
01:40:27.649 --> 01:40:27.659 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh both
 
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%

01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:33.649 align:start position:0%
oral and written and are there any
questions

01:40:33.649 --> 01:40:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:36.649 --> 01:40:36.659 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone

thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%

against this bill
 
01:40:45.110 --> 01:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
I am against the Bill thank you ma'am
 
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
if you could hand that to representative
 
01:41:08.770 --> 01:41:08.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:16.129 --> 01:41:16.139 align:start position:0%
saying none will await her written
 
01:41:16.139 --> 01:41:31.850 align:start position:0%
saying none will await her written
testimony

01:41:31.850 --> 01:41:31.860 align:start position:0%

01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
I think so
 
01:42:37.609 --> 01:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:43.260 align:start position:0%

contradiction to uh trucks for verse
 
01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
Granville 530 us 57 year 2000 in case
 
01:43:10.189 --> 01:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
we're Supreme Court of the United States
 
01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
citing constitutional right of parental
 
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
rights to the director upbringing the
 
01:43:15.410 --> 01:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
children struck down in Washington state
 
01:43:17.450 --> 01:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
law aloud any third party to petition
 
01:43:19.070 --> 01:43:19.080 align:start position:0%

01:43:22.729 --> 01:43:22.739 align:start position:0%
and parental objections unless
 
01:43:22.739 --> 01:43:23.870 align:start position:0%
and parental objections unless
um

01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:26.530 --> 01:43:26.540 align:start position:0%
unless obviously in a court of law
 
01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
illegal search and seizure for child
 
01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:29.689 align:start position:0%
illegal search and seizure for child
support

01:43:29.689 --> 01:43:29.699 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:43:31.970 --> 01:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
um has to have due process
 
01:43:34.729 --> 01:43:34.739 align:start position:0%
um and speaking to the lady behind me
 
01:43:37.310 --> 01:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
um just to help her
 
01:43:40.729 --> 01:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
um about the payments of Child Support
 
01:43:43.370 --> 01:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
the way I understand reading all the
 
01:43:46.729 --> 01:43:46.739 align:start position:0%
federal rules that if you cash a check
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
for payment then that's a payment it may
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
not be in full but that is a payment for
 
01:43:52.850 --> 01:43:52.860 align:start position:0%
child support and if it's cash then it's
 
01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:55.739 align:start position:0%
a legal tender I don't know her case but
 
01:43:58.370 --> 01:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to speak on that so anyway
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to oppose the bill for
 
01:44:01.970 --> 01:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
child support and arrears as Supreme
 
01:44:04.669 --> 01:44:04.679 align:start position:0%
Court ruled down that without proper due
 
01:44:04.679 --> 01:44:05.930 align:start position:0%
Court ruled down that without proper due
process

01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:06.950 align:start position:0%
process
um

01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:11.330 --> 01:44:11.340 align:start position:0%
the court has no interest in child care
 
01:44:12.770 --> 01:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
any questions for Mr Collier
 
01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Attorney Richard head
 
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
from the judicial branch to speak to the
 
01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:31.070 align:start position:0%
from the judicial branch to speak to the
bill

01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Richard head I'm
 
01:44:35.689 --> 01:44:35.699 align:start position:0%
the government Affairs coordinator for
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch truthfully I I don't
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
understand this bill at all the the bill
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
does two things it inserts a new
 
01:44:47.090 --> 01:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
paragraph Roman one in 461 A14 and
 
01:44:51.550 --> 01:44:51.560 align:start position:0%
repeals RSA 461 A14
 
01:44:54.830 --> 01:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph 18.
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
um and and I know Mr chairman you have a
 
01:44:58.970 --> 01:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
copy of the statute in front of you if
 
01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
you look at paragraph 18 which is the
 
01:45:04.129 --> 01:45:04.139 align:start position:0%
same section so 461 A14
 
01:45:08.090 --> 01:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
paragraph 18 which would be
 
01:45:09.290 --> 01:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:45:11.570 --> 01:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
Roman 18 yes so last paragraph in that
 
01:45:13.729 --> 01:45:13.739 align:start position:0%
last part in that section at least I
 
01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
went through it word for word and it's
 
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
the exact same as the section that's
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
being added to pair F1 so as near as I
 
01:45:22.209 --> 01:45:22.219 align:start position:0%
can tell this bill
 
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:25.380 align:start position:0%
repeals 18 and inserts it instead as
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph Roman 1.
 
01:45:29.629 --> 01:45:29.639 align:start position:0%
and I don't know why and I'm not sure
 
01:45:32.109 --> 01:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
what the goal was in in doing that
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not paragraph 18 needs
 
01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:36.530 align:start position:0%
whether or not paragraph 18 needs
Amendment

01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
um or changes you know that's a policy
 
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
issue but as near as I can tell the bill
 
01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
goes word for word and just inserts a
 
01:45:46.970 --> 01:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
new paragraph one it creates
 
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
complications I'm not sure if paragraph
 
01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
18 is cited anywhere but if it is any
 
01:45:54.109 --> 01:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
citation to paragraph 18 now has to be
 
01:45:56.209 --> 01:45:56.219 align:start position:0%
paragraph one
 
01:45:56.219 --> 01:45:56.990 align:start position:0%
paragraph one
um

01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:58.970 --> 01:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
so I can't I honestly don't know what
 
01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
the what the intent of doing that was
 
01:46:03.050 --> 01:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
just for reference moving something from
 
01:46:04.850 --> 01:46:04.860 align:start position:0%
18 to 1 doesn't give it any more
 
01:46:04.860 --> 01:46:06.109 align:start position:0%
18 to 1 doesn't give it any more
priority

01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
priority
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
um they're all important so we just
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
don't understand it
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
anyway that I would conclude my comments
 
01:46:14.450 --> 01:46:14.460 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions I
 
01:46:16.729 --> 01:46:16.739 align:start position:0%
will agree with you counselor that what
 
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
I read 18 Roman 18 to be is the wording
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
of the paragraph that is inserted and to
 
01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
my reading
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
um I see the bill changes absolutely
 
01:46:30.530 --> 01:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
nothing I couldn't find anything myself
 
01:46:33.169 --> 01:46:33.179 align:start position:0%
either um so if it does I got it here
 
01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:35.699 align:start position:0%
and I I also have it and I I've looked
 
01:46:37.490 --> 01:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
at it and I can't find it so if there is
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
a change it's subtle
 
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
um uh and but I couldn't find it
 
01:46:46.189 --> 01:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
so it
 
01:46:48.830 --> 01:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
May create I just don't know if we have
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
a form that cites to this paragraph if
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know what we have and it moves one
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
to be one a it it creates a new one
 
01:46:58.910 --> 01:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
which is paragraph 18 and then shifts
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
everything down so or shifts one into
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
one a so you don't have to renumber
 
01:47:05.689 --> 01:47:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
with the Indulgence of the committee I'm
 
01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
doing a side by side at much slower
 
01:47:13.790 --> 01:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
speed than I did initially to make sure
 
01:47:16.609 --> 01:47:16.619 align:start position:0%
that there is absolutely nothing done it
 
01:47:18.169 --> 01:47:18.179 align:start position:0%
five times very slowly and I because
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
every time I do it I think I'm missing
 
01:47:19.679 --> 01:47:26.870 align:start position:0%
every time I do it I think I'm missing
something

01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:28.729 --> 01:47:28.739 align:start position:0%
you know you keep this up I will go to
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:36.239 --> 01:47:55.550 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:59.270 --> 01:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
they look dead on word for word so the
 
01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
same punctuation appears the same
 
01:48:06.649 --> 01:48:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
thank you any any questions for attorney
 
01:48:09.239 --> 01:48:11.930 align:start position:0%
thank you any any questions for attorney
head

01:48:11.930 --> 01:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you sir thank you I see no more
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
cards are there any more cards that want
 
01:48:27.890 --> 01:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on House Bill 404
 
01:48:35.810 --> 01:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
and open the exact session on the same
 
01:48:40.010 --> 01:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
again we find that the prime sponsor is
 
01:48:44.930 --> 01:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
absent there is no co-sponsor there is
 
01:48:47.090 --> 01:48:47.100 align:start position:0%
no one present to testify in favor of
 
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
the bill the testimony is as you heard
 
01:48:54.290 --> 01:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
it paragraph one of the existing law is
 
01:48:57.290 --> 01:48:57.300 align:start position:0%
simply renumbered paragraph 1A
 
01:49:00.530 --> 01:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
the new paragraph one is word for word
 
01:49:06.410 --> 01:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
identical to 461 A14 Roman 18 which is
 
01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:08.450 align:start position:0%
identical to 461 A14 Roman 18 which is
repealed

01:49:08.450 --> 01:49:08.460 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:10.679 align:start position:0%

I've been asked to read
 
01:51:53.229 --> 01:51:53.239 align:start position:0%
house committee temporary replacement
 
01:51:58.550 --> 01:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
policy we will be having next week a a
 
01:52:02.209 --> 01:52:02.219 align:start position:0%
morning of executing some bills
 
01:52:04.430 --> 01:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
I'll send you all an email ahead of the
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
calendar so if you are not going to be
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
here or you're going to want to spend
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
time elsewhere listen to this any House
 
01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
member unable to participate in a
 
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
scheduled policy committee meeting may
 
01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:22.679 align:start position:0%
be replaced on a temporary basis using
 
01:52:25.010 --> 01:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
the following protocol
 
01:52:27.770 --> 01:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
how to notify of your absence
 
01:52:31.149 --> 01:52:31.159 align:start position:0%
contact your chair or designee
 
01:52:34.490 --> 01:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
of the chair or your ranking member
 
01:52:37.490 --> 01:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
Democrats to let that person know you
 
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
cannot participate in an upcoming
 
01:52:41.810 --> 01:52:41.820 align:start position:0%
executive session and do that as soon as
 
01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
possible your chair or ranking member
 
01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
will then determine if a replacement is
 
01:52:52.669 --> 01:52:52.679 align:start position:0%
necessary not all meetings necessitate a
 
01:52:57.649 --> 01:52:57.659 align:start position:0%
replacement if we plan on not executing
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
if it looks like the bills are
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
controversial enough that we will not
 
01:53:04.810 --> 01:53:04.820 align:start position:0%
exec immediately
 
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
you don't have to worry but if we are
 
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
going to exec or it looks like we're
 
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
going to exec and that's not always easy
 
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
to determine you'll want to contact us
 
01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
if it has been determined that a
 
01:53:19.129 --> 01:53:19.139 align:start position:0%
placement is necessary
 
01:53:22.609 --> 01:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
this person will notify your respective
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
caucus office either the house
 
01:53:26.930 --> 01:53:26.940 align:start position:0%
Republican office or house Democratic
 
01:53:29.629 --> 01:53:29.639 align:start position:0%
office so that the staff there may begin
 
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
the process of identifying a member to
 
01:53:34.250 --> 01:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
replace you for the day on your
 
01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:35.750 align:start position:0%
replace you for the day on your
committee

01:53:38.689 --> 01:53:38.699 align:start position:0%
the caucus office then submits a written
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
request to the speaker's office who
 
01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
approves the request and notifies the
 
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
proper entities to make sure that the
 
01:53:48.890 --> 01:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
replacement is on file with officers who
 
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
manage the meetings and keep the records
 
01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:53.330 align:start position:0%
manage the meetings and keep the records
deadline

01:53:53.330 --> 01:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
01:53:55.850 --> 01:53:55.860 align:start position:0%
with house committees requiring an
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
in-person attendance by legislators
 
01:54:01.250 --> 01:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
staff must be given the appropriate time
 
01:54:04.490 --> 01:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
to identify a replacement which may be
 
01:54:07.850 --> 01:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
one of many vacancies they're trying to
 
01:54:12.169 --> 01:54:12.179 align:start position:0%
fill on any given day therefore all
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
requests for temporary Replacements must
 
01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
be received by the house Republican or
 
01:54:21.649 --> 01:54:21.659 align:start position:0%
Democratic offices no later than 4 pm on
 
01:54:24.169 --> 01:54:24.179 align:start position:0%
the day prior to the meeting and by the
 
01:54:26.290 --> 01:54:26.300 align:start position:0%
way if you have to
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
Notify myself or vice chairman long you
 
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
got to do it before then because then
 
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
we've got to make the call by 4 pm is a
 
01:54:36.229 --> 01:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
Committee Member it is extremely
 
01:54:38.090 --> 01:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
important to notify your chair or
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
ranking member as soon as possible don't
 
01:54:43.010 --> 01:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
wait for the deadline because your
 
01:54:44.689 --> 01:54:44.699 align:start position:0%
caucus office will still need to
 
01:54:47.209 --> 01:54:47.219 align:start position:0%
identify a replacement contact the
 
01:54:49.609 --> 01:54:49.619 align:start position:0%
speaker's office and notify the proper
 
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
entities which takes time
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
when can I be replaced most Replacements
 
01:54:59.090 --> 01:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
happen when executive sessions are
 
01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:00.229 align:start position:0%
happen when executive sessions are
expected

01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
expected
 
01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:02.340 align:start position:0%
or properly noticed in the house
 
01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
calendar to ensure each party's vote
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
counts are not affected by absences keep
 
01:55:11.450 --> 01:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
an eye out for executive session notices
 
01:55:13.370 --> 01:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
in the calendar and I will try to let
 
01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
you know ahead of that time and stay in
 
01:55:18.169 --> 01:55:18.179 align:start position:0%
contact with your chair or ranking
 
01:55:20.209 --> 01:55:20.219 align:start position:0%
member to determine if votes may be
 
01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
taken on any given meeting day you
 
01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
cannot be replaced
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
due to conflicts with other business in
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
the state house or the lob if you're in
 
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
the building you cannot be replaced no
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
matter what else you're doing for
 
01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:36.890 align:start position:0%
matter what else you're doing for
example

01:55:36.890 --> 01:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:55:39.530 --> 01:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
you cannot be replaced in your Committee
 
01:55:42.350 --> 01:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
in order to introduce a bill in another
 
01:55:45.890 --> 01:55:45.900 align:start position:0%
committee or attend another hearing or
 
01:55:48.770 --> 01:55:48.780 align:start position:0%
in the house or Senate however you can
 
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
be replaced if you serve on two
 
01:55:53.410 --> 01:55:53.420 align:start position:0%
committees that happen to have
 
01:55:57.950 --> 01:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
conflicting executive sessions scheduled
 
01:56:01.010 --> 01:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
can you be replaced for partial day no
 
01:56:03.649 --> 01:56:03.659 align:start position:0%
if you seek to be replaced you are
 
01:56:05.629 --> 01:56:05.639 align:start position:0%
replaced for the day
 
01:56:07.729 --> 01:56:07.739 align:start position:0%
how long is the replacement good for
 
01:56:10.370 --> 01:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
members are typically replaced one day
 
01:56:13.970 --> 01:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
at a time however if you expect to be an
 
01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:17.580 align:start position:0%
ex in an extended absence you're having
 
01:56:19.310 --> 01:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
surgery you know you'll be out for a
 
01:56:22.010 --> 01:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
couple weeks your caucus office can
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
indicate the period of an extended
 
01:56:27.649 --> 01:56:27.659 align:start position:0%
absence or replacement if necessary can
 
01:56:30.050 --> 01:56:30.060 align:start position:0%
I request to replace myself with someone
 
01:56:34.430 --> 01:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
of my own choosing no only the
 
01:56:37.070 --> 01:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
Republican or Democratic leader can
 
01:56:39.770 --> 01:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
request that a member be temporarily
 
01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:41.090 align:start position:0%
request that a member be temporarily
replaced

01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:41.100 align:start position:0%

01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
please work with your caucus office to
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
determine the best way to handle your
 
01:56:48.290 --> 01:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
replacement any questions on the
 
01:56:51.010 --> 01:56:51.020 align:start position:0%
replacement policy
 
01:56:54.169 --> 01:56:54.179 align:start position:0%
representative side down I knew that
 
01:56:55.850 --> 01:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
before you did that
 
01:56:58.750 --> 01:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
um on the 24 hour or 4 pm the day before
 
01:57:01.370 --> 01:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
if it's the holiday on Monday where we
 
01:57:02.570 --> 01:57:02.580 align:start position:0%
meet Tuesday morning would it have to be
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
the Friday previous or is it still that
 
01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:09.109 align:start position:0%
the Friday previous or is it still that
Monday

01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
01:57:13.609 --> 01:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
that's a good question you want their
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
home phone numbers
 
01:57:17.870 --> 01:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
actually that did come up once and I did
 
01:57:20.930 --> 01:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
call uh one of the members of in my case
 
01:57:26.270 --> 01:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
the Republican office on his cell phone
 
01:57:28.850 --> 01:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
and I didn't know what he said after he
 
01:57:30.530 --> 01:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
hung up but he was very polite while I
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
was he was on the phone with me
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
so I don't know yeah do you see that
 
01:57:37.790 --> 01:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:40.729 --> 01:57:40.739 align:start position:0%
okay it's in in general hypothetical
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay that's a good thing to ask
 
01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:50.330 --> 01:57:50.340 align:start position:0%
um sure thank you Mr chairman
 
01:57:51.290 --> 01:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:57:53.410 --> 01:57:53.420 align:start position:0%
well I want to apologize for being late
 
01:57:56.750 --> 01:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
however every Tuesday there's a chair
 
01:57:59.450 --> 01:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
and vice chair meeting and
 
01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:00.229 align:start position:0%
and vice chair meeting and
um

01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:02.330 --> 01:58:02.340 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and I have decided that
 
01:58:04.729 --> 01:58:04.739 align:start position:0%
we're going to take turns
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
um he stayed last one I stayed this one
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
so and representative DeSimone it would
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
also be late because she's a vice chair
 
01:58:15.410 --> 01:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
on another committee uh so you know just
 
01:58:19.189 --> 01:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
to let you know that on Tuesdays from 9
 
01:58:22.810 --> 01:58:22.820 align:start position:0%
15 to 9 45 I believe
 
01:58:26.089 --> 01:58:26.099 align:start position:0%
so one of us will be late and that's the
 
01:58:28.189 --> 01:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
reason why we call them the designated
 
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
Survivor okay
 
01:58:32.290 --> 01:58:32.300 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want the people in the
 
01:58:37.129 --> 01:58:37.139 align:start position:0%
audience to understand that we mean
 
01:58:40.250 --> 01:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
absolutely no disrespect we understand
 
01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
that the uh bills will be called when
 
01:58:45.950 --> 01:58:45.960 align:start position:0%

01:58:48.589 --> 01:58:48.599 align:start position:0%

01:58:54.649 --> 01:58:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:56.689 --> 01:58:56.699 align:start position:0%

bypassed this committee
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
and is going directly to
 
01:59:41.209 --> 01:59:41.219 align:start position:0%
house finance
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%

I've been asked to entertain a motion to
retain

01:59:54.770 --> 01:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
retain
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%

02:00:12.169 --> 02:00:12.179 align:start position:0%
something goes wrong in the process
 
02:00:14.030 --> 02:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
we'll have it in our pocket to deal with
 
02:00:16.669 --> 02:00:16.679 align:start position:0%
if everything goes right and is signed
 
02:00:19.609 --> 02:00:19.619 align:start position:0%

February at the latest
 
02:00:25.729 --> 02:00:25.739 align:start position:0%

03:46:39.170 --> 03:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
sure they come down keep those cards and
 
03:46:43.370 --> 03:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
I just have one which could mean I've
 
03:46:48.530 --> 03:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
lost several others
 
03:46:53.469 --> 03:46:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
well I should
 
03:47:02.269 --> 03:47:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:07.910 --> 03:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:09.650 --> 03:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
didn't look I had a meeting over the
 
03:47:13.610 --> 03:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:17.210 --> 03:47:17.220 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on House Bill 411 the
 
03:47:20.050 --> 03:47:20.060 align:start position:0%
chair calls representative testerman the
 
03:47:23.269 --> 03:47:23.279 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill
 
03:47:25.610 --> 03:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
saying that representative testerman is
 
03:47:25.620 --> 03:47:27.050 align:start position:0%
saying that representative testerman is
absent

03:47:27.050 --> 03:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
absent
 
03:47:29.570 --> 03:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
Vice chairman long
 
03:47:31.790 --> 03:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Mr chairman I'd
 
03:47:33.729 --> 03:47:33.739 align:start position:0%
like to introduce House Bill
 
03:47:36.710 --> 03:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
411--f-n relative to the mediation of
 
03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
cases involving children
 
03:47:42.950 --> 03:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:47:45.469 --> 03:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
you have the bill before you it is very
 
03:47:50.290 --> 03:47:50.300 align:start position:0%
very small it repeals RSA
 
03:47:52.790 --> 03:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
461 for
 
03:47:55.370 --> 03:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
I mean a seven
 
03:47:58.429 --> 03:47:58.439 align:start position:0%
and instead we read
 
03:48:00.769 --> 03:48:00.779 align:start position:0%
the court May recommend mediation and
 
03:48:02.630 --> 03:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
give parents referrals of certified
 
03:48:06.309 --> 03:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
mediators but the court shall not order
 
03:48:09.349 --> 03:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
mediation that's what this bill seeks to
 
03:48:12.830 --> 03:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
do simply is to take away ordered
 
03:48:15.889 --> 03:48:15.899 align:start position:0%
mediation chair recognizes Attorney
 
03:48:18.290 --> 03:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
Richard head from the judicial branch to
 
03:48:18.300 --> 03:48:19.309 align:start position:0%
Richard head from the judicial branch to
speak

03:48:19.309 --> 03:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
speak
 
03:48:24.830 --> 03:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:26.570 --> 03:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you members
 
03:48:27.950 --> 03:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Richard head
 
03:48:29.570 --> 03:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
I'm the government Affairs coordinator
 
03:48:32.450 --> 03:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch
 
03:48:34.190 --> 03:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
um with this bill I do sort of
 
03:48:37.130 --> 03:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
understand I think the the idea that is
 
03:48:39.590 --> 03:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
behind it um the bill itself is very
 
03:48:42.469 --> 03:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
short the section though it seeks to
 
03:48:45.290 --> 03:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
repeal and replace is actually a fairly
 
03:48:48.410 --> 03:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
long and detailed and sort of talks
 
03:48:52.849 --> 03:48:52.859 align:start position:0%
about mediation in under 461 a
 
03:48:52.859 --> 03:48:53.510 align:start position:0%
about mediation in under 461 a
um

03:48:53.510 --> 03:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:55.490 --> 03:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
I did want to talk about our mediation
 
03:48:57.950 --> 03:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
program why it is it gets issued as an
 
03:49:00.170 --> 03:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
order and what some of the consequences
 
03:49:04.250 --> 03:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
would be of not allowing these to be
 
03:49:07.370 --> 03:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
issued by by an order first just in
 
03:49:10.790 --> 03:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
terms of the concept of mediation
 
03:49:13.190 --> 03:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's ordered or whether it is
 
03:49:13.200 --> 03:49:14.410 align:start position:0%
whether it's ordered or whether it is
simply

03:49:14.410 --> 03:49:14.420 align:start position:0%
simply
 
03:49:17.330 --> 03:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
created by the parties themselves not
 
03:49:18.650 --> 03:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
through an order
 
03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
the mediation itself is a a process that
 
03:49:25.309 --> 03:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
does not require the parties to reach
 
03:49:27.830 --> 03:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
agreement it is an opportunity to reach
 
03:49:29.929 --> 03:49:29.939 align:start position:0%
agreement and it's an opportunity to
 
03:49:32.330 --> 03:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
reach agreement on some or all of the
 
03:49:34.849 --> 03:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
issues that may be coming before the the
 
03:49:37.969 --> 03:49:37.979 align:start position:0%
court in their particular case
 
03:49:40.510 --> 03:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
the court and and
 
03:49:44.530 --> 03:49:44.540 align:start position:0%
uh the judges and the staff we do
 
03:49:49.010 --> 03:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
strongly encourage parties to mediate we
 
03:49:51.170 --> 03:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
have as you've heard me say and you'll
 
03:49:54.050 --> 03:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
continue to hear me say in extremely
 
03:49:57.889 --> 03:49:57.899 align:start position:0%
busy system and the more the parties are
 
03:50:01.010 --> 03:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
able to reach agreement the more issues
 
03:50:03.710 --> 03:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
they can resolve on their own the fewer
 
03:50:05.870 --> 03:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
that are in before a judge
 
03:50:08.150 --> 03:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the and when you're in front of a
 
03:50:11.389 --> 03:50:11.399 align:start position:0%
judge it is going to be adversarial
 
03:50:13.429 --> 03:50:13.439 align:start position:0%
um it is the nature of the proceeding so
 
03:50:17.269 --> 03:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
the the goal is wherever possible and
 
03:50:19.490 --> 03:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
whenever possible to have the parties
 
03:50:21.769 --> 03:50:21.779 align:start position:0%
reach agreement and if they are unable
 
03:50:24.469 --> 03:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
to do so on their own they do it with
 
03:50:26.389 --> 03:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
the help of a mediator
 
03:50:28.910 --> 03:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
so why is it that we order mediation
 
03:50:31.130 --> 03:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
which in and of itself is not a process
 
03:50:33.170 --> 03:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
that requires the parties to reach
 
03:50:35.690 --> 03:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
agreement it seems a little almost
 
03:50:37.670 --> 03:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
contradictory in the in the sense of
 
03:50:39.170 --> 03:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
well when you get there you don't have
 
03:50:40.729 --> 03:50:40.739 align:start position:0%
to actually reach agreement but you're
 
03:50:42.590 --> 03:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
being ordered to go there
 
03:50:44.450 --> 03:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
and there are some very practical
 
03:50:46.190 --> 03:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
reasons associated with that at some
 
03:50:49.190 --> 03:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
level one is
 
03:50:53.150 --> 03:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
um payment so if the parties are free to
 
03:50:56.030 --> 03:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
go out and select their own mediator
 
03:51:00.229 --> 03:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
um and and and pay their whatever it is
 
03:51:02.570 --> 03:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
they're going to charge the mediator can
 
03:51:05.269 --> 03:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
charge whatever they want to charge and
 
03:51:08.809 --> 03:51:08.819 align:start position:0%
the court is not going to help fund that
 
03:51:11.809 --> 03:51:11.819 align:start position:0%
even order is issued under this
 
03:51:14.990 --> 03:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
statutory provision the rule kicks in
 
03:51:17.330 --> 03:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
regarding how much the mediator is going
 
03:51:19.550 --> 03:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
to be paid and the mediator is going to
 
03:51:22.849 --> 03:51:22.859 align:start position:0%
be paid for 300 for up to four sessions
 
03:51:25.670 --> 03:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
plus an hour of and for at one hour
 
03:51:28.429 --> 03:51:28.439 align:start position:0%
sessions plus one hour of administration
 
03:51:28.439 --> 03:51:29.570 align:start position:0%
sessions plus one hour of administration
time

03:51:29.570 --> 03:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:51:33.170 --> 03:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
that is just sort of baked into the fee
 
03:51:36.410 --> 03:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
so unlike some who might charge 300 an
 
03:51:40.309 --> 03:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
hour 300 for a half day whatever it may
 
03:51:43.490 --> 03:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
be the fee is set by rule if it's issued
 
03:51:44.690 --> 03:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
as an order
 
03:51:47.269 --> 03:51:47.279 align:start position:0%
if the parties are Indigent and unable
 
03:51:50.210 --> 03:51:50.220 align:start position:0%
to pay again if it's issued as an order
 
03:51:52.610 --> 03:51:52.620 align:start position:0%
the Court's arbitration and mediation
 
03:51:54.790 --> 03:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
fund will pay for that
 
03:51:57.110 --> 03:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
but it still has to be issued as an
 
03:51:59.630 --> 03:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
order we're not going to pay the private
 
03:52:02.570 --> 03:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
mediator 300 an hour we're going to pay
 
03:52:05.150 --> 03:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
the mediator it's on the list under the
 
03:52:07.330 --> 03:52:07.340 align:start position:0%
court schedule the 300
 
03:52:09.710 --> 03:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
for four hours plus one hour of
 
03:52:12.650 --> 03:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
administration time so there is sort of
 
03:52:14.570 --> 03:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
a practical reason we do an order
 
03:52:16.550 --> 03:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes the parties will come to the
 
03:52:18.290 --> 03:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
court and say we want to mediate great
 
03:52:20.030 --> 03:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to issue an order of demediate
 
03:52:21.650 --> 03:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
because then they get into the system
 
03:52:23.990 --> 03:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
they get into that process that without
 
03:52:25.849 --> 03:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
the order they're simply not going to be
 
03:52:29.870 --> 03:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
eligible for it so there is sort of a
 
03:52:32.510 --> 03:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
very uh practical reason why we do this
 
03:52:35.389 --> 03:52:35.399 align:start position:0%
as as an order
 
03:52:37.910 --> 03:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the mediation process
 
03:52:40.910 --> 03:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
itself we do sort of evaluate whether or
 
03:52:42.410 --> 03:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
not it's working how it's working what
 
03:52:45.110 --> 03:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
the feedback is and the parties the
 
03:52:47.030 --> 03:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
participants in a in a mediation are
 
03:52:48.830 --> 03:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
asked to complete a survey it's
 
03:52:50.630 --> 03:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
completely voluntary they choose to
 
03:52:53.090 --> 03:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
great if they choose not to
 
03:52:55.550 --> 03:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
um then that's their decision so we have
 
03:52:59.929 --> 03:52:59.939 align:start position:0%
like survey results from 2021
 
03:53:01.729 --> 03:53:01.739 align:start position:0%
um I think it's 2021 I might be wrong
 
03:53:05.210 --> 03:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
about that we had 127 people participate
 
03:53:06.550 --> 03:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
in the survey
 
03:53:09.229 --> 03:53:09.239 align:start position:0%
and it was a pretty even split in terms
 
03:53:12.650 --> 03:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
of how they resolved about half of them
 
03:53:15.170 --> 03:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
settled all the issues about 22 percent
 
03:53:17.210 --> 03:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
settled some of the issues and about 23
 
03:53:19.729 --> 03:53:19.739 align:start position:0%
percent subtle no issues so you get a
 
03:53:21.729 --> 03:53:21.739 align:start position:0%
mix within the people
 
03:53:25.309 --> 03:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
of of who's providing feedback so the
 
03:53:27.530 --> 03:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
question uh on the survey did the
 
03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
mediator explain the process clearly 98
 
03:53:33.229 --> 03:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
said yes I was treated fairly and with
 
03:53:35.929 --> 03:53:35.939 align:start position:0%
respect 98 percent and said yes the
 
03:53:38.150 --> 03:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
mediator was impartial and treated all
 
03:53:40.990 --> 03:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
parties equally 95 percent said yes
 
03:53:44.269 --> 03:53:44.279 align:start position:0%
mediator helped us explore options 91
 
03:53:46.929 --> 03:53:46.939 align:start position:0%
percent said yes
 
03:53:49.309 --> 03:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
and then probably the most important I
 
03:53:51.889 --> 03:53:51.899 align:start position:0%
would use mediation again if needed in
 
03:53:56.269 --> 03:53:56.279 align:start position:0%
this or any other case 91 said yes it is
 
03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
a a at least the feedback we receive is
 
03:54:02.450 --> 03:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
very positive very favorably obviously
 
03:54:04.070 --> 03:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:54:04.080 --> 03:54:07.389 align:start position:0%
you know
oh

03:54:07.389 --> 03:54:07.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:10.010 --> 03:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
they get positive feedback
 
03:54:14.269 --> 03:54:14.279 align:start position:0%
it is a beneficial process because it
 
03:54:16.670 --> 03:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
does resolve issues it brings people
 
03:54:18.710 --> 03:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
together in front of a professional
 
03:54:22.250 --> 03:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
mediator who then is able to help people
 
03:54:25.070 --> 03:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
identify the issues see if there's areas
 
03:54:27.110 --> 03:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
of agreement see if their areas where
 
03:54:30.229 --> 03:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
simply you cannot agree and narrow
 
03:54:32.689 --> 03:54:32.699 align:start position:0%
potentially or eliminate the issues that
 
03:54:34.370 --> 03:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
are going to be brought before a judge
 
03:54:37.370 --> 03:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
in a adversarial proceeding with
 
03:54:39.650 --> 03:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
Witnesses with testimony whatever it may
 
03:54:39.660 --> 03:54:40.570 align:start position:0%
Witnesses with testimony whatever it may
be

03:54:40.570 --> 03:54:40.580 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:54:43.010 --> 03:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
so the the
 
03:54:43.020 --> 03:54:44.750 align:start position:0%
so the the
the

03:54:44.750 --> 03:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:54:44.760 --> 03:54:46.429 align:start position:0%
the
the bill

03:54:46.429 --> 03:54:46.439 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:54:50.269 --> 03:54:50.279 align:start position:0%
simply eliminates all of that and says
 
03:54:52.670 --> 03:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
parties use the free market decide
 
03:54:55.250 --> 03:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
whether or not you're going to be
 
03:54:58.370 --> 03:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
mediating and you lose an awful lot by
 
03:54:59.689 --> 03:54:59.699 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
03:54:59.699 --> 03:55:00.650 align:start position:0%
doing that
um

03:55:00.650 --> 03:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:00.660 --> 03:55:01.910 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:55:01.910 --> 03:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:55:04.610 --> 03:55:04.620 align:start position:0%
we do not support the bill is written
 
03:55:07.729 --> 03:55:07.739 align:start position:0%
because we really do need to have all of
 
03:55:10.370 --> 03:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
the tools available to us to be able to
 
03:55:13.250 --> 03:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
try to resolve issues and bring parties
 
03:55:16.030 --> 03:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
to agreement as opposed to
 
03:55:18.950 --> 03:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
the adversarial process that that you
 
03:55:21.889 --> 03:55:21.899 align:start position:0%
see in a courtroom with that I'll
 
03:55:23.450 --> 03:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
conclude my comments I'd be happy to
 
03:55:24.950 --> 03:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
03:55:28.849 --> 03:55:28.859 align:start position:0%
attorney had a Euro would you guess
 
03:55:32.210 --> 03:55:32.220 align:start position:0%
along with me that perhaps the reason
 
03:55:36.550 --> 03:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
for this bill is that there may be
 
03:55:39.769 --> 03:55:39.779 align:start position:0%
circumstances where it would be a bad
 
03:55:42.590 --> 03:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
idea to
 
03:55:46.010 --> 03:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
order mediation and with that in mind
 
03:55:51.229 --> 03:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with 461 a 7 Roman 5
 
03:55:54.590 --> 03:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
which reads the court shall not order
 
03:55:56.689 --> 03:55:56.699 align:start position:0%
mediation if there's a finding of
 
03:55:58.969 --> 03:55:58.979 align:start position:0%
domestic violence that is to say the
 
03:56:02.330 --> 03:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
existing law takes into account reasons
 
03:56:05.870 --> 03:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
why this shouldn't happen so a blanket
 
03:56:08.990 --> 03:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
statement is overreach
 
03:56:10.309 --> 03:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question I think
 
03:56:11.809 --> 03:56:11.819 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes
 
03:56:13.130 --> 03:56:13.140 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:56:13.140 --> 03:56:15.650 align:start position:0%
um and
the

03:56:15.650 --> 03:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:56:19.010 --> 03:56:19.020 align:start position:0%
it is extremely important and difficult
 
03:56:21.469 --> 03:56:21.479 align:start position:0%
because there's some that are we know
 
03:56:24.349 --> 03:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
there's been a DV petition filed
 
03:56:24.359 --> 03:56:25.130 align:start position:0%
there's been a DV petition filed
um

03:56:25.130 --> 03:56:25.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
then there you get into some that are
 
03:56:29.210 --> 03:56:29.220 align:start position:0%
more difficult the judge may not have
 
03:56:31.670 --> 03:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
affirmatively heard from a party that
 
03:56:36.170 --> 03:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:39.290 --> 03:56:39.300 align:start position:0%
a goal to make sure that if there's an
 
03:56:41.269 --> 03:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
to give everyone the opportunity to do
 
03:56:43.070 --> 03:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
that it's also through the mediation
 
03:56:46.729 --> 03:56:46.739 align:start position:0%
process and have the mediator and the
 
03:56:48.830 --> 03:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
mediators are knowledgeable about
 
03:56:51.710 --> 03:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not parties should be in
 
03:56:55.130 --> 03:56:55.140 align:start position:0%
mediation or if there's an undisclosed
 
03:56:57.290 --> 03:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
domestic violence issue or some other
 
03:56:59.150 --> 03:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
issue that
 
03:57:01.790 --> 03:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
if brought together create a greater
 
03:57:04.370 --> 03:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
risk and creates more problems whether
 
03:57:06.229 --> 03:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
you know that aspect of it can be done
 
03:57:08.269 --> 03:57:08.279 align:start position:0%
better or worse this build is simply
 
03:57:10.969 --> 03:57:10.979 align:start position:0%
does not address that and creates more
 
03:57:13.309 --> 03:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
problems because it takes the court out
 
03:57:18.590 --> 03:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:23.809 --> 03:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:26.870 --> 03:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone thank you Mr
 
03:57:26.880 --> 03:57:30.710 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone thank you Mr
chairman

03:57:30.710 --> 03:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:35.689 --> 03:57:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:39.050 --> 03:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure where this bill is
 
03:57:42.769 --> 03:57:42.779 align:start position:0%
headed but when I read
 
03:57:42.779 --> 03:57:44.170 align:start position:0%
headed but when I read
um

03:57:44.170 --> 03:57:44.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:51.650 --> 03:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
RSA 461 A7 and if I go to Roman 4 it
 
03:57:54.769 --> 03:57:54.779 align:start position:0%
gives a list of reasons uh the court may
 
03:57:58.610 --> 03:57:58.620 align:start position:0%
choose not to order mediation that
 
03:58:01.429 --> 03:58:01.439 align:start position:0%
include but are not limited to
 
03:58:05.710 --> 03:58:05.720 align:start position:0%
and I I can't imagine
 
03:58:08.510 --> 03:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
inserting anything else than this in
 
03:58:11.929 --> 03:58:11.939 align:start position:0%
this laundry list of undue hardship
 
03:58:15.349 --> 03:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
an agreement between the parties which
 
03:58:17.710 --> 03:58:17.720 align:start position:0%
would mean there's no need for mediation
 
03:58:22.849 --> 03:58:22.859 align:start position:0%
uh allegations of abuse alcoholism
 
03:58:24.790 --> 03:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
drug abuse
 
03:58:27.830 --> 03:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
psychological or emotional abuse
 
03:58:27.840 --> 03:58:29.269 align:start position:0%
psychological or emotional abuse
uh

03:58:29.269 --> 03:58:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:58:34.790 --> 03:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:37.729 --> 03:58:37.739 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this cover the gamut in your
 
03:58:40.429 --> 03:58:40.439 align:start position:0%
opinion so thank you for the question I
 
03:58:43.670 --> 03:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
think so if if we thought there should
 
03:58:45.290 --> 03:58:45.300 align:start position:0%
be other reasons one there's nothing
 
03:58:48.830 --> 03:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
stopping us from saying it's not on the
 
03:58:51.110 --> 03:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
list but for whatever reason these
 
03:58:52.849 --> 03:58:52.859 align:start position:0%
parties in front of us should not be
 
03:58:55.370 --> 03:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
together in a room in a mediation the
 
03:58:58.969 --> 03:58:58.979 align:start position:0%
the list is not limited to
 
03:59:02.870 --> 03:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
um so absolutely so I'm to answer your
 
03:59:04.849 --> 03:59:04.859 align:start position:0%
question no I'm unaware of any other
 
03:59:06.830 --> 03:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
specific circumstances where it would be
 
03:59:10.010 --> 03:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
helpful to include in the list and the
 
03:59:13.490 --> 03:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
list is uh is sufficiently brought to
 
03:59:15.889 --> 03:59:15.899 align:start position:0%
allow us to go outside of it if there
 
03:59:18.590 --> 03:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
are instances where
 
03:59:20.990 --> 03:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
parties have been ordered into mediation
 
03:59:22.910 --> 03:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
where they shouldn't have been
 
03:59:25.189 --> 03:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
we need to hear about those instances
 
03:59:27.530 --> 03:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
and as to what happened and why so that
 
03:59:29.410 --> 03:59:29.420 align:start position:0%
we can learn from them
 
03:59:32.510 --> 03:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean that we should as
 
03:59:35.269 --> 03:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
a blanket rule eliminate the court from
 
03:59:37.309 --> 03:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
being involved in ordering mediation I
 
03:59:39.710 --> 03:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
think that's a just a different
 
03:59:42.830 --> 03:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
step that that is really a not even just
 
03:59:44.689 --> 03:59:44.699 align:start position:0%
an overreach but is ultimately harmful
 
03:59:46.790 --> 03:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
to the process
 
03:59:48.170 --> 03:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:59:50.330 --> 03:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford thank you Mr
 
03:59:50.340 --> 03:59:51.710 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford thank you Mr
chairman

03:59:51.710 --> 03:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:59:54.290 --> 03:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
what I didn't notice in here uh the
 
03:59:54.300 --> 03:59:55.610 align:start position:0%
what I didn't notice in here uh the
statue

03:59:55.610 --> 03:59:55.620 align:start position:0%
statue
 
03:59:58.670 --> 03:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
is anything about those that may have
 
04:00:00.830 --> 04:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
agreed upon all their points some people
 
04:00:02.510 --> 04:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
do I know
 
04:00:04.790 --> 04:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh they just say well we just want a
 
04:00:06.769 --> 04:00:06.779 align:start position:0%
park company and we've already made our
 
04:00:07.969 --> 04:00:07.979 align:start position:0%
agreement how we're going to split up
 
04:00:10.250 --> 04:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
things do they need to go through the
 
04:00:13.010 --> 04:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
mediation they don't so we do so thank
 
04:00:15.950 --> 04:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
you for the question the there are a
 
04:00:15.960 --> 04:00:17.210 align:start position:0%
you for the question the there are a
significant

04:00:17.210 --> 04:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
significant
 
04:00:20.750 --> 04:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
percentage of cases
 
04:00:23.689 --> 04:00:23.699 align:start position:0%
by significant truth I I'll say 20 in
 
04:00:25.790 --> 04:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
the 20 some odd percent and I might be
 
04:00:27.229 --> 04:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
completely wrong about that so don't
 
04:00:28.969 --> 04:00:28.979 align:start position:0%
hold on don't write it down okay just
 
04:00:31.429 --> 04:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
don't write that one down but it it it's
 
04:00:33.950 --> 04:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
not it's a substantial number who
 
04:00:36.650 --> 04:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
are going through this process are able
 
04:00:38.650 --> 04:00:38.660 align:start position:0%
to reach full agreements and file
 
04:00:42.349 --> 04:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
agreements and they have almost no court
 
04:00:42.359 --> 04:00:43.910 align:start position:0%
agreements and they have almost no court
interaction

04:00:43.910 --> 04:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
interaction
 
04:00:47.269 --> 04:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
well if I may follow through but I don't
 
04:00:49.070 --> 04:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
see it in the statute that says they
 
04:00:50.870 --> 04:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
would be excused from
 
04:00:53.090 --> 04:00:53.100 align:start position:0%
um mediation and that was my point I
 
04:00:55.210 --> 04:00:55.220 align:start position:0%
guess do we need anything like that so
 
04:00:58.370 --> 04:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
should I say
 
04:00:58.380 --> 04:00:59.570 align:start position:0%
should I say
um

04:00:59.570 --> 04:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:02.389 --> 04:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to find it under they
 
04:01:04.309 --> 04:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
don't they do not I've only got seven in
 
04:01:05.450 --> 04:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
front of me uh I don't know if there's
 
04:01:07.969 --> 04:01:07.979 align:start position:0%
something before that or not if if the
 
04:01:10.309 --> 04:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
parties have reached agreement so the
 
04:01:14.630 --> 04:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
other aspect of this is so at uh at the
 
04:01:18.050 --> 04:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
first session they are there's a there's
 
04:01:20.330 --> 04:01:20.340 align:start position:0%
a Corp there's somebody in the court
 
04:01:22.550 --> 04:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
system that's assigned to their case and
 
04:01:25.309 --> 04:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
we'll meet with them and if they're
 
04:01:27.410 --> 04:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
reaching an agreement on their own
 
04:01:29.750 --> 04:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
without the need for a mediator
 
04:01:31.550 --> 04:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
they are not going to be forced into
 
04:01:33.170 --> 04:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
into a mediation where they've already
 
04:01:35.510 --> 04:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
resolved all the problems sometimes the
 
04:01:37.849 --> 04:01:37.859 align:start position:0%
parties are able to reach agreement they
 
04:01:39.590 --> 04:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
just don't know how to sort of document
 
04:01:41.389 --> 04:01:41.399 align:start position:0%
it so they go okay we'll either work
 
04:01:43.550 --> 04:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
with the court staff person and sort of
 
04:01:46.130 --> 04:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
then document it or maybe they need to
 
04:01:48.950 --> 04:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
use the mediator to sort of finalize the
 
04:01:52.250 --> 04:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
individual terms but no parties are able
 
04:01:55.429 --> 04:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
to and do reach agreement without going
 
04:01:59.510 --> 04:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
through a court-ordered mediation
 
04:02:02.570 --> 04:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative DeSimone I
 
04:02:05.570 --> 04:02:05.580 align:start position:0%
think you had a point of information
 
04:02:08.330 --> 04:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
um I did find a point of information to
 
04:02:10.729 --> 04:02:10.739 align:start position:0%
your question
 
04:02:13.729 --> 04:02:13.739 align:start position:0%
um representative Bickford it does
 
04:02:13.739 --> 04:02:15.469 align:start position:0%
um representative Bickford it does
discuss

04:02:15.469 --> 04:02:15.479 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
04:02:17.689 --> 04:02:17.699 align:start position:0%
um the court shall not order mediation
 
04:02:19.610 --> 04:02:19.620 align:start position:0%
if there is a finding of domestic
 
04:02:23.870 --> 04:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
violence as defined in 173 B colon 1
 
04:02:28.610 --> 04:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
unless all parties agreed to mediation
 
04:02:30.469 --> 04:02:30.479 align:start position:0%
but that's under that
 
04:02:32.929 --> 04:02:32.939 align:start position:0%
if I made the the that's under the
 
04:02:34.849 --> 04:02:34.859 align:start position:0%
domestic violence part I was speaking
 
04:02:37.429 --> 04:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
broadly about not people necessarily
 
04:02:39.590 --> 04:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
coming under that umbrella thank you
 
04:02:43.929 --> 04:02:43.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:47.269 --> 04:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
in going to the the uh representative
 
04:02:49.790 --> 04:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
desimone's point in the list it's not
 
04:02:51.950 --> 04:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
limited to this list so if the parties
 
04:02:53.809 --> 04:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
come to the judge and say we've got
 
04:02:55.610 --> 04:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
everything reached you know we're done
 
04:02:57.889 --> 04:02:57.899 align:start position:0%
we're not gonna We're Not Gonna force
 
04:03:00.710 --> 04:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
him into a process that they don't need
 
04:03:03.889 --> 04:03:03.899 align:start position:0%
um and in that circumstance we just we
 
04:03:06.769 --> 04:03:06.779 align:start position:0%
do though if there are issues we do
 
04:03:08.809 --> 04:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
pretty strongly encourage people into
 
04:03:08.819 --> 04:03:10.490 align:start position:0%
pretty strongly encourage people into
mediation

04:03:10.490 --> 04:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
mediation
 
04:03:14.809 --> 04:03:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:17.570 --> 04:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
further questions anyone
 
04:03:19.610 --> 04:03:19.620 align:start position:0%
representative Simoni what was the
 
04:03:25.849 --> 04:03:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.859 --> 04:03:45.590 align:start position:0%
 
7.

04:03:45.590 --> 04:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:45.600 --> 04:03:50.210 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:03:50.210 --> 04:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:00.229 --> 04:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:02.330 --> 04:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
with the concurrence I almost said
 
04:04:04.849 --> 04:04:04.859 align:start position:0%
complicity concurrence
 
04:04:08.150 --> 04:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
of the ranking member I closed the
 
04:04:11.269 --> 04:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:12.710 --> 04:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:04:12.720 --> 04:04:14.870 align:start position:0%
this bill
411

04:04:14.870 --> 04:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
411
 
04:04:19.429 --> 04:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
and open the exact section session on
 
04:04:20.870 --> 04:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
the same
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:40.010 --> 04:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
once again the sponsor
 
04:04:43.010 --> 04:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
is not here nor is there any co-sponsor
 
04:04:46.729 --> 04:04:46.739 align:start position:0%
who could answer any questions there has
 
04:04:49.610 --> 04:04:49.620 align:start position:0%
been no positive testimony on this
 
04:04:53.410 --> 04:04:53.420 align:start position:0%
and as we heard section
 
04:04:59.330 --> 04:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
RSA 461 A7 opened up we understood that
 
04:05:01.849 --> 04:05:01.859 align:start position:0%
there are reasons where the court would
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
not order this and I think we understand
 
04:05:08.330 --> 04:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
that a domestic violence situation is
 
04:05:11.929 --> 04:05:11.939 align:start position:0%
well within that boundary we also saw
 
04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
that there's numbers of reasons why the
 
04:05:16.490 --> 04:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
court might choose not to
 
04:05:20.689 --> 04:05:20.699 align:start position:0%
we also knew that uh know that if both
 
04:05:24.010 --> 04:05:24.020 align:start position:0%
parties are Indigent I'm quoting the law
 
04:05:26.809 --> 04:05:26.819 align:start position:0%
then the mediator should be paid to set
 
04:05:26.819 --> 04:05:27.790 align:start position:0%
then the mediator should be paid to set
free

04:05:27.790 --> 04:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
free
 
04:05:31.550 --> 04:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
it seems that any to my mind possible
 
04:05:35.330 --> 04:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
reason why we should in a blanket way
 
04:05:40.309 --> 04:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
strike the Court's duty to get mediation
 
04:05:42.590 --> 04:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
going on have been answered in the law
 
04:05:42.600 --> 04:05:43.670 align:start position:0%
going on have been answered in the law
already

04:05:43.670 --> 04:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:05:46.429 --> 04:05:46.439 align:start position:0%
and that there's nothing to be gained by
 
04:05:49.309 --> 04:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
this bill and there's quite a bit that
 
04:05:52.429 --> 04:05:52.439 align:start position:0%
could be lost that's just my two cents
 
04:05:58.490 --> 04:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:01.309 --> 04:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
chair will entertain a
 
04:06:01.319 --> 04:06:03.229 align:start position:0%
chair will entertain a
motion

04:06:03.229 --> 04:06:03.239 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:06:06.590 --> 04:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
from representative
 
04:06:08.689 --> 04:06:08.699 align:start position:0%
are you making a motion I'm not making
 
04:06:10.370 --> 04:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
motion I wanted to make a comment I'll
 
04:06:12.650 --> 04:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
just entertain your comment excellent
 
04:06:14.990 --> 04:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:06:15.000 --> 04:06:15.910 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

04:06:15.910 --> 04:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:20.150 --> 04:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
I have concerns that we would be tying
 
04:06:23.090 --> 04:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
the Court's hands with this bill as
 
04:06:25.070 --> 04:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to it seems like the court has
 
04:06:27.769 --> 04:06:27.779 align:start position:0%
adequate discretion at this point with
 
04:06:29.990 --> 04:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
the current law so so I'm essentially
 
04:06:32.269 --> 04:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
echoing what you were saying before but
 
04:06:33.469 --> 04:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to let you know I'm in
 
04:06:33.479 --> 04:06:34.790 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to let you know I'm in
agreement

04:06:34.790 --> 04:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
agreement

04:06:41.630 --> 04:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:47.090 --> 04:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:52.210 --> 04:06:52.220 align:start position:0%

agree there should be
 
04:35:15.359 --> 04:35:25.390 align:start position:0%
agree there should be
um

04:35:25.390 --> 04:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:28.970 --> 04:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
the whole point of parenting plans and
 
04:35:32.689 --> 04:35:32.699 align:start position:0%
children's uh best interests once again
 
04:35:35.330 --> 04:35:35.340 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court has ruled that um
 
04:35:39.170 --> 04:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
Troxel versus gavel in 2000 that um the
 
04:35:42.590 --> 04:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
courts don't have any uh interest in
 
04:35:46.070 --> 04:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
in family as Equity is is property and
 
04:35:48.709 --> 04:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
finances and not actual people
 
04:35:48.719 --> 04:35:49.609 align:start position:0%
finances and not actual people
um

04:35:49.609 --> 04:35:49.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:52.670 --> 04:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry clarify that I'm trying to get
 
04:35:54.529 --> 04:35:54.539 align:start position:0%
my mind around you're saying that the
 
04:35:56.330 --> 04:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
court would that be the U.S Supreme
 
04:35:58.730 --> 04:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
Court the family court the family court
 
04:36:01.250 --> 04:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire correct or any family
 
04:36:03.410 --> 04:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
court it's not a criminal court right
 
04:36:05.750 --> 04:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
right so they to the Supreme Court the
 
04:36:07.609 --> 04:36:07.619 align:start position:0%
U.S Supreme Courts ruled that the family
 
04:36:11.051 --> 04:36:11.061 align:start position:0%
courts don't have any ground or interest
 
04:36:13.910 --> 04:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
in the family issues um
 
04:36:15.529 --> 04:36:15.539 align:start position:0%
because for the child's best interest
 
04:36:19.310 --> 04:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
it's not to have a third party arbiter
 
04:36:21.529 --> 04:36:21.539 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of the kid especially
 
04:36:23.170 --> 04:36:23.180 align:start position:0%
when the judge doesn't know either party
 
04:36:25.250 --> 04:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
would you give the Supreme Court
 
04:36:25.260 --> 04:36:27.170 align:start position:0%
would you give the Supreme Court
citation

04:36:27.170 --> 04:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
citation
 
04:36:29.330 --> 04:36:29.340 align:start position:0%

04:36:41.869 --> 04:36:41.879 align:start position:0%
uh Supreme Court Troxell versus
 
04:36:46.429 --> 04:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
Granville 530 U.S 57 in year 2000 where
 
04:36:47.990 --> 04:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court said that uh family

04:36:49.320 --> 04:36:52.189 align:start position:0%
courts
um

04:36:52.189 --> 04:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:52.199 --> 04:36:54.769 align:start position:0%

thank you sir okay uh stating that it's
 
04:37:20.631 --> 04:37:20.641 align:start position:0%

um
 
04:37:36.470 --> 04:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
I hate to use this as my case because
 
04:37:38.689 --> 04:37:38.699 align:start position:0%
it's an ongoing thing
 
04:37:38.699 --> 04:37:41.150 align:start position:0%
it's an ongoing thing
um

04:37:41.150 --> 04:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:43.310 --> 04:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
the the judge or the family court
 
04:37:44.631 --> 04:37:44.641 align:start position:0%
doesn't have
 
04:37:44.641 --> 04:37:45.530 align:start position:0%
doesn't have
um

04:37:45.530 --> 04:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:45.540 --> 04:37:47.631 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

04:37:47.631 --> 04:37:47.641 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:37:49.849 --> 04:37:49.859 align:start position:0%
with the evidence submitted such as like
 
04:37:51.650 --> 04:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
psychological records and psychiatric
 
04:37:51.660 --> 04:37:53.029 align:start position:0%
psychological records and psychiatric
records

04:37:53.029 --> 04:37:53.039 align:start position:0%
records
 
04:37:53.039 --> 04:37:54.289 align:start position:0%
records
um

04:37:54.289 --> 04:37:54.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:56.570 --> 04:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
my judge decided to contradict both
 
04:37:58.010 --> 04:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
medical records and then give me
 
04:38:01.070 --> 04:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
counseling for 25 different hypothetical
 
04:38:01.080 --> 04:38:02.810 align:start position:0%
counseling for 25 different hypothetical
orders

04:38:02.810 --> 04:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
orders
 
04:38:04.609 --> 04:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
um the very first reason the judge gave
 
04:38:06.590 --> 04:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
me for supervised visits and this was 12
 
04:38:08.390 --> 04:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
04:38:10.670 --> 04:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
um was so my son doesn't lose memory of
 
04:38:12.131 --> 04:38:12.141 align:start position:0%
his good relationship with his father
 
04:38:14.330 --> 04:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
that was the number one reason I got
 
04:38:16.010 --> 04:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
supervised visits through the family
 
04:38:18.830 --> 04:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:21.470 --> 04:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
not only that the judge said that I was
 
04:38:23.510 --> 04:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
confused which which is kind of weird
 
04:38:25.070 --> 04:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
because he's practicing medicine without
 
04:38:27.109 --> 04:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
a medical license and they didn't really
 
04:38:28.849 --> 04:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
04:38:30.470 --> 04:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
um so anyway
 
04:38:32.810 --> 04:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
um yeah I agree that it should be
 
04:38:35.330 --> 04:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
appealed uh or repealed
 
04:38:35.340 --> 04:38:35.929 align:start position:0%
appealed uh or repealed
um

04:38:35.929 --> 04:38:35.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:38.209 --> 04:38:38.219 align:start position:0%
and there there is no best interest of
 
04:38:40.910 --> 04:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
the kid when there's title 40 incentives
 
04:38:42.949 --> 04:38:42.959 align:start position:0%
uh through the federal government to
 
04:38:45.289 --> 04:38:45.299 align:start position:0%
give the judge matching funds every time
 
04:38:47.090 --> 04:38:47.100 align:start position:0%
he grants child support so there's no
 
04:38:48.529 --> 04:38:48.539 align:start position:0%
actual incentive for the judge to
 
04:38:51.650 --> 04:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
actually follow due process so
 
04:38:51.660 --> 04:38:53.029 align:start position:0%
actually follow due process so
um

04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:55.010 --> 04:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
and I have all the evidence any
 
04:38:55.020 --> 04:38:58.551 align:start position:0%
and I have all the evidence any
questions

04:38:58.551 --> 04:38:58.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:01.849 --> 04:39:01.859 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson I'm I'm just a
 
04:39:04.131 --> 04:39:04.141 align:start position:0%
little confused because
 
04:39:06.709 --> 04:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
um I'm I pulled up the statute and it's
 
04:39:09.650 --> 04:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
talking about parenting plans like in
 
04:39:14.051 --> 04:39:14.061 align:start position:0%
terms of holidays and birthdays and
 
04:39:16.730 --> 04:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
schedules and transportation and
 
04:39:19.429 --> 04:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
exchange of the child so I'm confused
 
04:39:22.010 --> 04:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
about how your testimony is pertaining
 
04:39:23.689 --> 04:39:23.699 align:start position:0%
to that
 
04:39:26.209 --> 04:39:26.219 align:start position:0%
well when the judge grants the parenting
 
04:39:28.131 --> 04:39:28.141 align:start position:0%
plan right
 
04:39:29.570 --> 04:39:29.580 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be in the best instance
 
04:39:31.131 --> 04:39:31.141 align:start position:0%
of a child and it's not supposed to be a
 
04:39:33.051 --> 04:39:33.061 align:start position:0%
party uh
 
04:39:37.250 --> 04:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
granted uh equally not all for one
 
04:39:39.530 --> 04:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
parent right
 
04:39:41.630 --> 04:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
um that's actually not what happens in
 
04:39:42.830 --> 04:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if you want to see the
 
04:39:44.990 --> 04:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
evidence so
 
04:39:45.000 --> 04:39:46.070 align:start position:0%
evidence so
um

04:39:46.070 --> 04:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:48.590 --> 04:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
there is no best interest from a judge
 
04:39:50.930 --> 04:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
granting for a child that he doesn't
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
know right if he gets matching funds
 
04:39:55.310 --> 04:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
through the government to run his
 
04:39:55.320 --> 04:39:56.270 align:start position:0%
through the government to run his
courtroom

04:39:56.270 --> 04:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
courtroom
 
04:39:57.708 --> 04:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
he's not looking out for the best
 
04:40:00.050 --> 04:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
interest of the kid he's he's running a
 
04:40:03.590 --> 04:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
business so the parenting plan
 
04:40:05.690 --> 04:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
should be mediated between both parties
 
04:40:07.730 --> 04:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
only and not anybody else Supreme Court
 
04:40:10.430 --> 04:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
already ruled on that so
 
04:40:12.050 --> 04:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
but it says an act relative to court
 
04:40:15.470 --> 04:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
ordered Counseling in parenting plans so
 
04:40:17.930 --> 04:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
if the judge contradicts the psyche vows
 
04:40:19.850 --> 04:40:19.860 align:start position:0%
and then practices medicine with a
 
04:40:21.230 --> 04:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
medical license that needs to be
 
04:40:22.788 --> 04:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
addressed first before we try and change
 
04:40:27.110 --> 04:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:29.270 --> 04:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:40:32.330 --> 04:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
any other questions Jim
 
04:40:35.030 --> 04:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:37.070 --> 04:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford thank you Mr
 
04:40:37.080 --> 04:40:38.690 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford thank you Mr
chairman

04:40:38.690 --> 04:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:40:40.910 --> 04:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
um well I I think
 
04:40:44.390 --> 04:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
Society has been using uh the system of
 
04:40:48.350 --> 04:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
of a judge or so since uh King Solomon
 
04:40:51.708 --> 04:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
um now Troxel I don't know if you're
 
04:40:55.310 --> 04:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
aware was a grandparent rights issue and
 
04:40:57.590 --> 04:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
not between two parents well there was
 
04:40:59.990 --> 04:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
two parents involved but one died
 
04:41:01.970 --> 04:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
and the case came out of Washington it's
 
04:41:04.250 --> 04:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
what gave us a parental why we didn't
 
04:41:06.708 --> 04:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
give grandparents similar rights as
 
04:41:06.718 --> 04:41:07.850 align:start position:0%
give grandparents similar rights as
parents

04:41:07.850 --> 04:41:07.860 align:start position:0%
parents
 
04:41:09.470 --> 04:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that's really the right
 
04:41:16.788 --> 04:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:19.310 --> 04:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:41:21.770 --> 04:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton thank you Mr
 
04:41:23.990 --> 04:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
chairman so
 
04:41:25.850 --> 04:41:25.860 align:start position:0%
in all of the evidence that you
 
04:41:28.368 --> 04:41:28.378 align:start position:0%
presented I I was a little confused on
 
04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
if you support
 
04:41:33.708 --> 04:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
this bill as written or not
 
04:41:36.650 --> 04:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
I support repealing the parenting plan
 
04:41:36.660 --> 04:41:37.610 align:start position:0%
I support repealing the parenting plan
bill

04:41:37.610 --> 04:41:37.620 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:41:39.110 --> 04:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
in the fourth because there's other
 
04:41:42.830 --> 04:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
between the 461 A6 A7 uh and I believe
 
04:41:44.868 --> 04:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
A2 there's a lot of discrepancies that
 
04:41:46.910 --> 04:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed that go along with
 
04:41:49.128 --> 04:41:49.138 align:start position:0%
the parenting plan that I found uh very
 
04:41:51.170 --> 04:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
conflicting information
 
04:41:54.650 --> 04:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
um that's why I submitted it to
 
04:42:00.770 --> 04:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:03.470 --> 04:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm not sure that
 
04:42:05.390 --> 04:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
why you would
 
04:42:07.250 --> 04:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
suggests that
 
04:42:09.470 --> 04:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
um repealing parenting plans in general
 
04:42:12.110 --> 04:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
would be the solution to there being
 
04:42:16.310 --> 04:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
there has to be an equally
 
04:42:22.850 --> 04:42:22.860 align:start position:0%
agreed upon parenting plan right so the
 
04:42:24.530 --> 04:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
judges can't order a parenting plan
 
04:42:26.510 --> 04:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
without actual due process and having
 
04:42:28.970 --> 04:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
your rights actually taken away by a
 
04:42:31.910 --> 04:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
proper court so until that happens which
 
04:42:34.128 --> 04:42:34.138 align:start position:0%
it never does because they always give
 
04:42:35.868 --> 04:42:35.878 align:start position:0%
protective orders in Family Court
 
04:42:38.750 --> 04:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
without actual proper criminal
 
04:42:38.760 --> 04:42:39.948 align:start position:0%
without actual proper criminal
prosecution

04:42:39.948 --> 04:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
prosecution
 
04:42:42.650 --> 04:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
so when they do that and they Implement
 
04:42:44.510 --> 04:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
a parenting plan
 
04:42:46.490 --> 04:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
it's always in the best interest of
 
04:42:48.530 --> 04:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
usually the mother if you go by
 
04:42:50.570 --> 04:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
statistically it's like over 90 I don't
 
04:42:52.490 --> 04:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
have the exact number
 
04:42:52.500 --> 04:42:53.390 align:start position:0%
have the exact number
um

04:42:53.390 --> 04:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:55.250 --> 04:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
and we have to we have to figure out why
 
04:42:58.310 --> 04:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
that is and and why the family court is
 
04:43:01.250 --> 04:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
is is making these rules
 
04:43:04.070 --> 04:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
for parents when they're directly
 
04:43:07.128 --> 04:43:07.138 align:start position:0%
contradicting the evidence to submitted
 
04:43:09.590 --> 04:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
so that's I mean we have to get to the
 
04:43:11.930 --> 04:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
bottom of it before we fix other things
 
04:43:14.930 --> 04:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
so if you're just fixing small things
 
04:43:16.850 --> 04:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
you still have have a bigger problem
 
04:43:20.330 --> 04:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
that they're still not following law and
 
04:43:22.430 --> 04:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
doing what they're doing like a judge
 
04:43:23.990 --> 04:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
can't say that you're confused if your
 
04:43:27.350 --> 04:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
eval says you're not right so
 
04:43:29.750 --> 04:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
when they Implement plans that are
 
04:43:31.550 --> 04:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
actually directly contradicting the
 
04:43:31.560 --> 04:43:33.590 align:start position:0%
actually directly contradicting the
evidence

04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
04:43:35.690 --> 04:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
we have to have a bigger a bigger
 
04:43:37.550 --> 04:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
discussion of what's really going on in
 
04:43:39.170 --> 04:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
these family courts
 
04:43:41.570 --> 04:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
so then are you suggesting that if there
 
04:43:43.090 --> 04:43:43.100 align:start position:0%
was no
 
04:43:45.410 --> 04:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
legal parenting plan that the court
 
04:43:47.270 --> 04:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
followed that they would just Implement
 
04:43:49.610 --> 04:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
what you and your ex decided is that
 
04:43:51.470 --> 04:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
what is that what you they would have to
 
04:43:53.750 --> 04:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
implement something right so first of
 
04:43:54.948 --> 04:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
all they have to have first of all they
 
04:43:56.810 --> 04:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
have to have legal jurisdiction right so
 
04:43:58.368 --> 04:43:58.378 align:start position:0%
if you're not wanted for a crime they
 
04:44:00.050 --> 04:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
can't come they can't make orders over
 
04:44:02.570 --> 04:44:02.580 align:start position:0%
you they can't just arbitrarily say well
 
04:44:04.670 --> 04:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
your son has your last name but
 
04:44:06.170 --> 04:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get to see him for
 
04:44:09.470 --> 04:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
12 years right which happened in my case
 
04:44:12.050 --> 04:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
so they have to they have to be able to
 
04:44:15.170 --> 04:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
run the program legally first of all
 
04:44:18.050 --> 04:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
they have to have jurisdiction over you
 
04:44:18.060 --> 04:44:19.730 align:start position:0%
they have to have jurisdiction over you
so

04:44:19.730 --> 04:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:44:21.708 --> 04:44:21.718 align:start position:0%
If the parents can't communicate there
 
04:44:23.208 --> 04:44:23.218 align:start position:0%
has to be a way to the community to
 
04:44:25.368 --> 04:44:25.378 align:start position:0%
communicate for a plan right and that's
 
04:44:26.930 --> 04:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
why we're here
 
04:44:26.940 --> 04:44:28.250 align:start position:0%
why we're here
um

04:44:28.250 --> 04:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:29.810 --> 04:44:29.820 align:start position:0%
it's just not in the best interest of
 
04:44:32.208 --> 04:44:32.218 align:start position:0%
the child to have a judge do it
 
04:44:34.070 --> 04:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
right because he's getting Financial
 
04:44:36.230 --> 04:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
funds to run his courtroom
 
04:44:38.390 --> 04:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
so when they do that it's a conflict of
 
04:44:40.250 --> 04:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
interest so they're never going to look
 
04:44:41.570 --> 04:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
out for the best interest of the kid
 
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
when they're doing a parenting plan
 
04:44:46.850 --> 04:44:46.860 align:start position:0%
so in mine they said Mr Collier will
 
04:44:48.470 --> 04:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
know exactly what's expected of him
 
04:44:51.050 --> 04:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
right well why is anything expected of
 
04:44:53.330 --> 04:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
me if there's no evidence of wrongdoing
 
04:44:55.550 --> 04:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
should be 50 50.
 
04:44:58.190 --> 04:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
so we have to fix a problem ahead of the
 
04:44:58.200 --> 04:44:59.330 align:start position:0%
so we have to fix a problem ahead of the
small

04:44:59.330 --> 04:44:59.340 align:start position:0%
small
 
04:45:02.448 --> 04:45:02.458 align:start position:0%
statues and statues are really only
 
04:45:04.550 --> 04:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
followed and agreed upon if they're
 
04:45:06.230 --> 04:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
agreed upon by both parties then they're
 
04:45:09.110 --> 04:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
legal but it's not an actual ultimate
 
04:45:11.690 --> 04:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
law supreme law in its Constitution
 
04:45:13.490 --> 04:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
so a lot of these statues are are
 
04:45:13.500 --> 04:45:15.410 align:start position:0%
so a lot of these statues are are
unconstitutional

04:45:15.410 --> 04:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
04:45:17.510 --> 04:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
so before we start writing these we need
 
04:45:19.430 --> 04:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
to figure out why they're
 
04:45:21.708 --> 04:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and why they're being
 
04:45:26.868 --> 04:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:30.830 --> 04:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:32.810 --> 04:45:32.820 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
04:45:35.628 --> 04:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
all right thank you so much thank you
 
04:45:39.650 --> 04:45:39.660 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes
 
04:45:41.208 --> 04:45:41.218 align:start position:0%
Matthew Hayes
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:51.230 --> 04:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:53.810 --> 04:45:53.820 align:start position:0%
anybody what
 
04:45:56.510 --> 04:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
I should have known that thank you I got
 
04:45:58.850 --> 04:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
the HHS part I took six years to learn
 
04:45:59.930 --> 04:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
that one
 
04:46:02.090 --> 04:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
my apologies with chairman uh I should
 
04:46:04.010 --> 04:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
I'll write it out next time just to make
 
04:46:05.690 --> 04:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
sure probably for about six months and
 
04:46:07.490 --> 04:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
then I think I'll be good okay no
 
04:46:09.470 --> 04:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
problem thank you
 
04:46:11.448 --> 04:46:11.458 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh my name is attorney
 
04:46:15.530 --> 04:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
Matthew Hayes from Bureau chocolate oh
 
04:46:17.570 --> 04:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
I turned it on this time okay now we're
 
04:46:17.580 --> 04:46:18.730 align:start position:0%
I turned it on this time okay now we're
even

04:46:18.730 --> 04:46:18.740 align:start position:0%
even
 
04:46:20.990 --> 04:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
now this time I need to make sure I get
 
04:46:23.270 --> 04:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
it towards my uh where I'm talking
 
04:46:25.128 --> 04:46:25.138 align:start position:0%
um very quickly I just want to thank you
 
04:46:27.288 --> 04:46:27.298 align:start position:0%
for letting me to uh speak on behalf of
 
04:46:29.390 --> 04:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Child Support
 
04:46:31.850 --> 04:46:31.860 align:start position:0%
um sort of a housekeeping matters how I
 
04:46:33.770 --> 04:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
would refer to it in court
 
04:46:36.230 --> 04:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
um it was requested that the bureau
 
04:46:40.850 --> 04:46:40.860 align:start position:0%
provide a fiscal note and most recently
 
04:46:43.670 --> 04:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
when we reviewed the docket on The
 
04:46:45.590 --> 04:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
house's website it said that it was
 
04:46:48.288 --> 04:46:48.298 align:start position:0%
still outstanding we submitted a fiscal
 
04:46:48.298 --> 04:46:49.310 align:start position:0%
still outstanding we submitted a fiscal
note

04:46:49.310 --> 04:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
note
 
04:46:52.610 --> 04:46:52.620 align:start position:0%
uh and I believe January 13th um I know
 
04:46:54.770 --> 04:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
that the lva is is working hard I'm sure
 
04:46:56.330 --> 04:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
they're super busy
 
04:46:57.890 --> 04:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
um but I just want to make sure that the
 
04:46:59.868 --> 04:46:59.878 align:start position:0%
committee if they didn't already have it
 
04:47:02.208 --> 04:47:02.218 align:start position:0%
wanted to know our fiscal position was
 
04:47:06.110 --> 04:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
that this bill uh as a policy decision
 
04:47:08.628 --> 04:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
were neutral but there's no fiscal
 
04:47:10.970 --> 04:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
impact that we were able to determine
 
04:47:13.550 --> 04:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
for our program so I just want to make
 
04:47:15.250 --> 04:47:15.260 align:start position:0%
sure the committee had that information
 
04:47:19.368 --> 04:47:19.378 align:start position:0%
no fiscal impact thank you
 
04:47:21.530 --> 04:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions but I I
 
04:47:24.410 --> 04:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
generally I on this type of Bill we
 
04:47:26.150 --> 04:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
don't deal with parenting plan so I
 
04:47:28.128 --> 04:47:28.138 align:start position:0%
really didn't add anything other than
 
04:47:30.350 --> 04:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
really no fiscal impact I just didn't
 
04:47:31.850 --> 04:47:31.860 align:start position:0%
want it to look like that we didn't
 
04:47:31.860 --> 04:47:33.250 align:start position:0%
want it to look like that we didn't
respond

04:47:33.250 --> 04:47:33.260 align:start position:0%
respond
 
04:47:35.570 --> 04:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton
 
04:47:38.150 --> 04:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I know he said
 
04:47:39.350 --> 04:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
you weren't going to take any questions
 
04:47:41.330 --> 04:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
but I thought
 
04:47:43.850 --> 04:47:43.860 align:start position:0%
I thought that the child support section
 
04:47:46.368 --> 04:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
is under the parenting plan is it not or
 
04:47:47.990 --> 04:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
is that a separate section
 
04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh no I'm sorry if I misspoke I'm happy
 
04:47:51.708 --> 04:47:51.718 align:start position:0%
to take questions from the committee
 
04:47:51.718 --> 04:47:52.730 align:start position:0%
to take questions from the committee
already

04:47:52.730 --> 04:47:52.740 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:47:54.890 --> 04:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
um I just uh
 
04:47:57.650 --> 04:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
my program deals with enforcing and
 
04:47:59.990 --> 04:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
establishmenting child support orders
 
04:48:02.930 --> 04:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
um were were resources are confined
 
04:48:07.010 --> 04:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
towards that end and we don't deal with
 
04:48:08.990 --> 04:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
parenting plans so
 
04:48:09.000 --> 04:48:09.770 align:start position:0%
parenting plans so
um

04:48:09.770 --> 04:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:13.190 --> 04:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
when it's written in the the divorce
 
04:48:13.200 --> 04:48:14.330 align:start position:0%
when it's written in the the divorce
papers

04:48:14.330 --> 04:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
papers
 
04:48:17.330 --> 04:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't the child support fall under the
 
04:48:19.310 --> 04:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
parenting plan uh the child support
 
04:48:21.590 --> 04:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
would be issued in the uniform support
 
04:48:24.170 --> 04:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
order which is a separate uh form a
 
04:48:26.390 --> 04:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
court form I say okay I'd be happy to
 
04:48:28.190 --> 04:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
provide a blank copy to the
 
04:48:30.230 --> 04:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative if you wish no it's okay
 
04:48:32.448 --> 04:48:32.458 align:start position:0%
I just I just wasn't sure if this spill
 
04:48:36.110 --> 04:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
would repeal that so okay that's all
 
04:48:38.868 --> 04:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
child support's not in here
 
04:48:41.090 --> 04:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
but if it was part of the parenting plan
 
04:48:44.410 --> 04:48:44.420 align:start position:0%
then it would end up incidentally
 
04:48:47.570 --> 04:48:47.580 align:start position:0%
repealed in the event it was in the
 
04:48:49.128 --> 04:48:49.138 align:start position:0%
parenting plan if it's a separate issue
 
04:48:51.050 --> 04:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
then it's not going to be
 
04:48:53.208 --> 04:48:53.218 align:start position:0%
yeah that's why I was just asking a
 
04:48:55.368 --> 04:48:55.378 align:start position:0%
question if it was or not well I think
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
child support plans are somewhere else
 
04:49:00.110 --> 04:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
in here uh
 
04:49:03.890 --> 04:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
but to eliminate something that isn't
 
04:49:03.900 --> 04:49:04.910 align:start position:0%
but to eliminate something that isn't
there

04:49:04.910 --> 04:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:49:07.970 --> 04:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
wouldn't preclude it coming in later
 
04:49:11.868 --> 04:49:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:14.208 --> 04:49:14.218 align:start position:0%
I got the answer because it's it's not
 
04:49:16.010 --> 04:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
under the parenting plan so so it would
 
04:49:17.628 --> 04:49:17.638 align:start position:0%
not be repealed I'm glad we had this
 
04:49:17.638 --> 04:49:19.910 align:start position:0%
not be repealed I'm glad we had this
conversation

04:49:19.910 --> 04:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
04:49:23.570 --> 04:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:26.868 --> 04:49:26.878 align:start position:0%
thank you so much counselor and we now
 
04:49:30.708 --> 04:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
call on Attorney Richard head from the
 
04:49:38.930 --> 04:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:40.368 --> 04:49:40.378 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
04:49:42.410 --> 04:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Richard head I
 
04:49:43.850 --> 04:49:43.860 align:start position:0%
am the government Affairs coordinator
 
04:49:45.788 --> 04:49:45.798 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch
 
04:49:48.948 --> 04:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
we do not support this this bill which
 
04:49:51.770 --> 04:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
would repeal the section dealing with
 
04:49:53.868 --> 04:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
parenting plans I don't know if you
 
04:49:56.448 --> 04:49:56.458 align:start position:0%
remember but when judge Gardner came and
 
04:49:59.868 --> 04:49:59.878 align:start position:0%
spoke at it at the at the introductory
 
04:50:02.570 --> 04:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
session he identified our parenting
 
04:50:05.570 --> 04:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
plans as one of the most effective tools
 
04:50:08.470 --> 04:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
that we have in parenting cases
 
04:50:12.050 --> 04:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
after that presentation I did forward a
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
copy of our parenting plan form to the
 
04:50:16.850 --> 04:50:16.860 align:start position:0%
committee I'm happy if anyone wants
 
04:50:20.570 --> 04:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
another copy to resend it it is
 
04:50:23.868 --> 04:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
a well laid out form that follows a
 
04:50:27.230 --> 04:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
statutory provisions and it is it
 
04:50:30.410 --> 04:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
provides a step-by-step basis for
 
04:50:34.670 --> 04:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
parties to go through and identify
 
04:50:38.448 --> 04:50:38.458 align:start position:0%
really all of the parenting issues in in
 
04:50:41.350 --> 04:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
fairly simple ways but in great detail
 
04:50:45.170 --> 04:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
parenting issues that the parties need
 
04:50:48.530 --> 04:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
to resolve and try to resolve before
 
04:50:51.350 --> 04:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
coming before a judge and the goal of
 
04:50:54.288 --> 04:50:54.298 align:start position:0%
the parenting plan is for the parties to
 
04:50:56.990 --> 04:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
reach agreement on the content of that
 
04:50:59.390 --> 04:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
parenting plan not to have a parenting
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
plan imposed upon them and the and and
 
04:51:06.650 --> 04:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
it takes the parties through
 
04:51:09.650 --> 04:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
the Essential Elements of what needs to
 
04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
be in a parenting plan who has
 
04:51:14.390 --> 04:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
decision-making responsibility what are
 
04:51:17.030 --> 04:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
the residential responsibilities and and
 
04:51:20.208 --> 04:51:20.218 align:start position:0%
schedules holiday and birthday planning
 
04:51:23.470 --> 04:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
three-day weekends vacation schedules
 
04:51:26.628 --> 04:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
supervised Vision uh parenting time if
 
04:51:28.930 --> 04:51:28.940 align:start position:0%
applicable other parental
 
04:51:32.330 --> 04:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and and just lays it
 
04:51:34.670 --> 04:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
out in fairly simple terms but requires
 
04:51:37.310 --> 04:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
the parties to think about it and
 
04:51:40.788 --> 04:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
hopefully come to resolution or if they
 
04:51:42.708 --> 04:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
can't come to resolution on all of them
 
04:51:45.288 --> 04:51:45.298 align:start position:0%
they come to resolution on a large
 
04:51:47.410 --> 04:51:47.420 align:start position:0%
number of them
 
04:51:49.850 --> 04:51:49.860 align:start position:0%
so a couple things with regard to the
 
04:51:51.948 --> 04:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
bill which would eliminate the statutory
 
04:51:54.470 --> 04:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
provision on parenting Plans by the way
 
04:51:56.750 --> 04:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of references to that
 
04:51:58.990 --> 04:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
section throughout the statutes
 
04:52:01.970 --> 04:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
that are now left hanging If This Were
 
04:52:04.850 --> 04:52:04.860 align:start position:0%
to be repealed
 
04:52:07.490 --> 04:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
it's unclear as to as from our
 
04:52:09.590 --> 04:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
perspective as to why it is that this
 
04:52:15.170 --> 04:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
this bill would would come forward where
 
04:52:18.230 --> 04:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
one of the essential things that has to
 
04:52:20.510 --> 04:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
be resolved in a parenting case is
 
04:52:23.750 --> 04:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
parenting issues and if we take away
 
04:52:26.570 --> 04:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
that essential tool
 
04:52:29.150 --> 04:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
sort of how do we come to those to those
 
04:52:31.310 --> 04:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
resolutions and I appreciate the thought
 
04:52:34.730 --> 04:52:34.740 align:start position:0%
of you know judges why are Judges making
 
04:52:37.310 --> 04:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
these decisions judges are not making
 
04:52:40.670 --> 04:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
these decisions if they don't need to
 
04:52:43.850 --> 04:52:43.860 align:start position:0%
um if there is no agreement or if the
 
04:52:46.010 --> 04:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
agreement is ultimately not in the best
 
04:52:47.770 --> 04:52:47.780 align:start position:0%
interest of the children
 
04:52:50.510 --> 04:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
the judge gets involved but the judges
 
04:52:52.010 --> 04:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
are not looking to get involved they're
 
04:52:53.690 --> 04:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
looking for the parties to reach
 
04:52:56.030 --> 04:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
agreement looking for something that
 
04:52:58.368 --> 04:52:58.378 align:start position:0%
works and that is most likely going to
 
04:53:00.590 --> 04:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
happen when the parties develop it
 
04:53:03.948 --> 04:53:03.958 align:start position:0%
themselves so
 
04:53:06.650 --> 04:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
in in summary we do not support the bill
 
04:53:09.470 --> 04:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
we find that parenting plan process is
 
04:53:12.470 --> 04:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
is extremely effective uh and is an
 
04:53:14.750 --> 04:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
essential Tool uh for the courts to have
 
04:53:17.448 --> 04:53:17.458 align:start position:0%
and taking that away will have
 
04:53:20.150 --> 04:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
significant ramifications in in these
 
04:53:22.070 --> 04:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
types of cases and with that I'll
 
04:53:23.628 --> 04:53:23.638 align:start position:0%
conclude my comments but I would be
 
04:53:26.208 --> 04:53:26.218 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
04:53:28.250 --> 04:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton
 
04:53:30.050 --> 04:53:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:53:32.448 --> 04:53:32.458 align:start position:0%
um what would you anticipate would be
 
04:53:36.170 --> 04:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
the outcome in the event that apparent
 
04:53:38.570 --> 04:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
there was no parenting plan whatsoever
 
04:53:39.948 --> 04:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question I
 
04:53:42.050 --> 04:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
suspect we would Implement something
 
04:53:44.628 --> 04:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
through a rule
 
04:53:46.250 --> 04:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
um and we would have to
 
04:53:47.448 --> 04:53:47.458 align:start position:0%
um because I'm not quite sure what else
 
04:53:49.070 --> 04:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
we would do
 
04:53:50.990 --> 04:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
um it is the thing that we're trying to
 
04:53:51.000 --> 04:53:52.490 align:start position:0%
um it is the thing that we're trying to
resolve

04:53:52.490 --> 04:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
resolve
 
04:53:54.350 --> 04:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
you would like a follow-up wouldn't you
 
04:53:56.570 --> 04:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
I sure would you may have a one thank
 
04:53:56.580 --> 04:53:57.350 align:start position:0%
I sure would you may have a one thank
you

04:53:57.350 --> 04:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:54:02.270 --> 04:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:05.090 --> 04:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
I mean I just I foresee a lot of issues
 
04:54:08.448 --> 04:54:08.458 align:start position:0%
with this so I see uh more than a lot of
 
04:54:12.770 --> 04:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:14.390 --> 04:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
how would you hold someone in contempt
 
04:54:16.250 --> 04:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
like how would you know that you've met
 
04:54:18.708 --> 04:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
all of the different you know that you
 
04:54:20.990 --> 04:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
fully resolved how like to parent
 
04:54:23.390 --> 04:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
between these two individuals that are
 
04:54:27.110 --> 04:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know as a practical matter I I just
 
04:54:30.530 --> 04:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
I have to assume without knowing that
 
04:54:35.150 --> 04:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
um as a branch we would need to develop
 
04:54:37.310 --> 04:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
a very essentially a parallel process
 
04:54:39.708 --> 04:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
through rulemaking and through a Court
 
04:54:41.510 --> 04:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
rule and through a court I mean we have
 
04:54:42.890 --> 04:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
a form we would probably just implement
 
04:54:44.750 --> 04:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
the form through rules but
 
04:54:47.390 --> 04:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
I don't get it I don't get why the
 
04:54:49.670 --> 04:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
statute would would come out and it
 
04:54:52.010 --> 04:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
creates just sort of logistical problems
 
04:54:53.930 --> 04:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
within the statutory framework of
 
04:54:57.350 --> 04:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
everything we have as a form that
 
04:54:59.810 --> 04:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
references the section needs the work
 
04:55:01.368 --> 04:55:01.378 align:start position:0%
that would go into change you know
 
04:55:03.890 --> 04:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
fixing the statutory and Rule and form
 
04:55:03.900 --> 04:55:05.510 align:start position:0%
fixing the statutory and Rule and form
references

04:55:05.510 --> 04:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
references
 
04:55:05.520 --> 04:55:07.128 align:start position:0%
references
for

04:55:07.128 --> 04:55:07.138 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:55:08.990 --> 04:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
what we do not understand to be the
 
04:55:12.230 --> 04:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
reason is is a lot of work that would
 
04:55:14.750 --> 04:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
take a great deal of resources for and
 
04:55:16.670 --> 04:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
and then to create a essentially a new
 
04:55:16.680 --> 04:55:18.470 align:start position:0%
and then to create a essentially a new
process

04:55:18.470 --> 04:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:55:18.480 --> 04:55:19.250 align:start position:0%
process
um

04:55:19.250 --> 04:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:22.670 --> 04:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
is is just at a time when the court does
 
04:55:25.190 --> 04:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
not have sufficient resources
 
04:55:28.368 --> 04:55:28.378 align:start position:0%
um it is unclear as to why we would be
 
04:55:30.530 --> 04:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
04:55:33.550 --> 04:55:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:36.230 --> 04:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
04:55:38.510 --> 04:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um and thank you
 
04:55:42.230 --> 04:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
attorney ahead for taking my question my
 
04:55:43.970 --> 04:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
question is
 
04:55:46.610 --> 04:55:46.620 align:start position:0%
um kind of a more Global question than
 
04:55:48.350 --> 04:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
just New Hampshire so we have this great
 
04:55:50.390 --> 04:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
parenting plan Forum which is frankly in
 
04:55:53.390 --> 04:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
my opinion a model for other states
 
04:55:55.190 --> 04:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
um but pretty much every state has their
 
04:55:57.110 --> 04:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
own and there's a federal law the
 
04:56:06.190 --> 04:56:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:09.110 --> 04:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson knows it the uniform I
 
04:56:11.570 --> 04:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
can read child uniform child custody
 
04:56:15.050 --> 04:56:15.060 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and Enforcement Act yes so
 
04:56:17.930 --> 04:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is would we run a
 
04:56:20.810 --> 04:56:20.820 align:start position:0%
foul of those Federal requirements
 
04:56:25.368 --> 04:56:25.378 align:start position:0%
should we get rid of our parenting plan
 
04:56:25.378 --> 04:56:26.030 align:start position:0%
should we get rid of our parenting plan
um

04:56:26.030 --> 04:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:28.730 --> 04:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
it's a good question that on off the off
 
04:56:30.470 --> 04:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
the cuff I'm going to be reluctant to
 
04:56:32.930 --> 04:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
answer well it would be easier if I said
 
04:56:35.090 --> 04:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
it right the first no no that's fine I
 
04:56:36.770 --> 04:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
get what you're saying and I and I know
 
04:56:37.850 --> 04:56:37.860 align:start position:0%
what you're saying I just wouldn't been
 
04:56:39.470 --> 04:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
able to come up with the words
 
04:56:42.890 --> 04:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
um and I'm so I'm just reluctant to just
 
04:56:45.530 --> 04:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
to answer that some type and I didn't
 
04:56:47.628 --> 04:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
specifically in preparation for today so
 
04:56:49.430 --> 04:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
I think that through okay okay um sorry
 
04:56:50.990 --> 04:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
I apologize nope that's all right thank
 
04:56:56.030 --> 04:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
you my question is if all this went away
 
04:56:59.390 --> 04:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement
 
04:57:02.270 --> 04:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
for a parenting plan to be worked out by
 
04:57:03.590 --> 04:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
04:57:06.050 --> 04:57:06.060 align:start position:0%
and if all this went away wouldn't it be
 
04:57:11.810 --> 04:57:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:15.230 --> 04:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
procedures if one parent relocates and
 
04:57:17.750 --> 04:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
takes the child or children that we have
 
04:57:20.270 --> 04:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
no mandated holiday birthday vacation
 
04:57:23.208 --> 04:57:23.218 align:start position:0%
planning that we have no mandated legal
 
04:57:25.190 --> 04:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
residents for a child for attending
 
04:57:29.150 --> 04:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
school were all this to go away so my
 
04:57:32.448 --> 04:57:32.458 align:start position:0%
question is would this not mean
 
04:57:36.170 --> 04:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
what happens in these and other issues
 
04:57:39.830 --> 04:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
is by which parent is the stronger and
 
04:57:41.448 --> 04:57:41.458 align:start position:0%
can get away with it
 
04:57:44.390 --> 04:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
if there is no mandated
 
04:57:47.150 --> 04:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
having them work a plan out I think what
 
04:57:48.530 --> 04:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
it would so thank you for the question
 
04:57:48.540 --> 04:57:49.910 align:start position:0%
it would so thank you for the question
it

04:57:49.910 --> 04:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:57:53.530 --> 04:57:53.540 align:start position:0%
I think that yes I think at some level
 
04:57:57.708 --> 04:57:57.718 align:start position:0%
every single time there is
 
04:58:00.948 --> 04:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
any disagreement which is true anyway
 
04:58:04.070 --> 04:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
but if we don't have a parenting plan in
 
04:58:06.110 --> 04:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
order to fall back on
 
04:58:08.810 --> 04:58:08.820 align:start position:0%
every they're just continuously making
 
04:58:14.170 --> 04:58:14.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:17.810 --> 04:58:17.820 align:start position:0%
order document template to say this is
 
04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
what this is what we're falling back on
 
04:58:22.070 --> 04:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
this is the default which is the
 
04:58:24.590 --> 04:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
parenting plan you want to deviate from
 
04:58:27.050 --> 04:58:27.060 align:start position:0%
the parenting plan come back to the
 
04:58:28.970 --> 04:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
court and and tell us why and tell us
 
04:58:32.628 --> 04:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
how it how you know why that is but at
 
04:58:34.310 --> 04:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
the end of the day the parenting plan
 
04:58:36.708 --> 04:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
will re will be the thing that resolves
 
04:58:36.718 --> 04:58:38.448 align:start position:0%
will re will be the thing that resolves
dispute

04:58:38.448 --> 04:58:38.458 align:start position:0%
dispute
 
04:58:41.750 --> 04:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
and and and and the goal is to try to
 
04:58:44.628 --> 04:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
limit ongoing future disputes and and to
 
04:58:46.788 --> 04:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
have this outline through the plan
 
04:58:50.150 --> 04:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
so is it the case that absent a
 
04:58:52.730 --> 04:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
parenting plan it would either be
 
04:58:56.570 --> 04:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
the tougher stronger richer parent would
 
04:59:00.770 --> 04:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
rule it because of force or they would
 
04:59:03.288 --> 04:59:03.298 align:start position:0%
be constant going back to the court
 
04:59:06.550 --> 04:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
constant documents constant expense
 
04:59:10.730 --> 04:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
I think the the latter one uh and
 
04:59:13.670 --> 04:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
um and in some level to the extent
 
04:59:16.010 --> 04:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
relative to the first if if there is a
 
04:59:19.550 --> 04:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
disparity financially that party can use
 
04:59:21.708 --> 04:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
that in a way to the detriment or the
 
04:59:24.470 --> 04:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
other for the pure sake of of doing it
 
04:59:27.288 --> 04:59:27.298 align:start position:0%
to the detriment of the other
 
04:59:29.090 --> 04:59:29.100 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
04:59:31.910 --> 04:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative Vice chairman long
 
04:59:34.670 --> 04:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so Mr head the
 
04:59:36.650 --> 04:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
the uh part of this chapter they're
 
04:59:40.430 --> 04:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
looking to repeal uh it also states that
 
04:59:40.440 --> 04:59:41.690 align:start position:0%
looking to repeal uh it also states that
uh

04:59:41.690 --> 04:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:59:44.650 --> 04:59:44.660 align:start position:0%
uh neither parent shall be described as
 
04:59:48.050 --> 04:59:48.060 align:start position:0%
Heaven's child reside primary
 
04:59:51.288 --> 04:59:51.298 align:start position:0%
or Primary Residential responsibility or
 
04:59:51.298 --> 04:59:52.490 align:start position:0%
or Primary Residential responsibility or
custody

04:59:52.490 --> 04:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
custody
 
04:59:55.670 --> 04:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
or Primary Residential parents so in
 
04:59:58.490 --> 04:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
your opinion would we revert revert back
 
04:59:59.990 --> 05:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
to judges
 
05:00:00.000 --> 05:00:01.868 align:start position:0%
to judges
giving

05:00:01.868 --> 05:00:01.878 align:start position:0%
giving
 
05:00:04.850 --> 05:00:04.860 align:start position:0%
a parent the residential the primary
 
05:00:07.810 --> 05:00:07.820 align:start position:0%
care parent or the
 
05:00:11.510 --> 05:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
Primary Residential period which gave us
 
05:00:14.330 --> 05:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
all these issues that brought us to this
 
05:00:16.490 --> 05:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question I think
 
05:00:18.410 --> 05:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
probably at least in the short term we
 
05:00:20.510 --> 05:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
would sort of stick with what we're used
 
05:00:22.310 --> 05:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
to but I don't know how it would start
 
05:00:24.770 --> 05:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
to change over time
 
05:00:26.990 --> 05:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
um and and where it flows back into and
 
05:00:29.090 --> 05:00:29.100 align:start position:0%
and you know you lose the structure and
 
05:00:30.770 --> 05:00:30.780 align:start position:0%
you might start to lose the the
 
05:00:32.208 --> 05:00:32.218 align:start position:0%
structure within the decision making
 
05:00:34.670 --> 05:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
that's why I do think ultimately If This
 
05:00:36.830 --> 05:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
Were to pass
 
05:00:39.050 --> 05:00:39.060 align:start position:0%
um there would be a another structure
 
05:00:40.190 --> 05:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
that we would just have to create
 
05:00:40.200 --> 05:00:41.288 align:start position:0%
that we would just have to create
separately

05:00:41.288 --> 05:00:41.298 align:start position:0%
separately
 
05:00:43.850 --> 05:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
because that structure is is sort of
 
05:00:50.170 --> 05:00:50.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:53.628 --> 05:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone
 
05:00:55.730 --> 05:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:00:58.910 --> 05:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
attorney head for taking my question
 
05:01:03.410 --> 05:01:03.420 align:start position:0%
um isn't it true that wherever there is
 
05:01:08.090 --> 05:01:08.100 align:start position:0%
a an area that could be in conflict in
 
05:01:11.990 --> 05:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
this parenting plan that I just read it
 
05:01:15.050 --> 05:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
gives the opportunity to the parents to
 
05:01:18.770 --> 05:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
resolve any issue and if they cannot
 
05:01:22.610 --> 05:01:22.620 align:start position:0%
that is where the court intervenes
 
05:01:24.410 --> 05:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
um so thank you yes that is absolutely
 
05:01:26.270 --> 05:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
right and that is
 
05:01:29.390 --> 05:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely what we want
 
05:01:34.750 --> 05:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
um and and so that is the goal thank you
 
05:01:38.150 --> 05:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:01:40.250 --> 05:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
saying no one thank you so much thank
 
05:01:44.330 --> 05:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
you any pink card on House Bill 635 that
 
05:01:49.128 --> 05:01:49.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:51.708 --> 05:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the hearing on
 
05:01:55.368 --> 05:01:55.378 align:start position:0%
House Bill 635. Let's actually want to
 
05:01:58.970 --> 05:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
go to exec and I now open the executive
 
05:02:02.930 --> 05:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 635 and let's have
 
05:02:04.850 --> 05:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
any discussion we might want to have
 
05:02:07.610 --> 05:02:07.620 align:start position:0%
before we entertain a motion
 
05:02:07.620 --> 05:02:10.788 align:start position:0%
before we entertain a motion
representative

05:02:10.788 --> 05:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:14.030 --> 05:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
Raymond uh thank you Mr chairman
 
05:02:18.170 --> 05:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
um I think the theme today has been
 
05:02:21.890 --> 05:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
um a general feeling of concern on the
 
05:02:25.490 --> 05:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
part of some of these bills about how
 
05:02:25.500 --> 05:02:26.750 align:start position:0%
part of some of these bills about how
long

05:02:26.750 --> 05:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
long
 
05:02:29.990 --> 05:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
um the process is taking in Family Court
 
05:02:34.010 --> 05:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
um you know and and allowing families to
 
05:02:37.490 --> 05:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
to proceed potentially uh more
 
05:02:38.930 --> 05:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
efficiently through the system and I
 
05:02:40.788 --> 05:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
think that's a laudable goal I think
 
05:02:40.798 --> 05:02:42.110 align:start position:0%
think that's a laudable goal I think
that

05:02:42.110 --> 05:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:02:44.448 --> 05:02:44.458 align:start position:0%
um the court could use something to
 
05:02:46.368 --> 05:02:46.378 align:start position:0%
assist it with that I just don't think
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
that these bills on this one in
 
05:02:52.030 --> 05:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
particular is the mechanism by which we
 
05:02:55.990 --> 05:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
fix or improve the system that we have
 
05:02:59.930 --> 05:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
I said earlier I think that the New
 
05:03:02.830 --> 05:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire parenting plan form is a model
 
05:03:06.110 --> 05:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
having worked in New York and I'm
 
05:03:07.990 --> 05:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with Massachusetts
 
05:03:11.628 --> 05:03:11.638 align:start position:0%
custody it's much better than those two
 
05:03:13.250 --> 05:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
other states I can't speak for all
 
05:03:15.530 --> 05:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
states but ours is so much more user
 
05:03:17.770 --> 05:03:17.780 align:start position:0%
friendly and easy to understand
 
05:03:21.708 --> 05:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
so my my opinion on this one is that
 
05:03:24.590 --> 05:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately once again I don't think
 
05:03:28.670 --> 05:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
it should move forward as written
 
05:03:31.448 --> 05:03:31.458 align:start position:0%
thank you so much anyone else
 
05:03:34.910 --> 05:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton thank you Mr
 
05:03:37.550 --> 05:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I have a lot of concerns
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
about this bill I think it's unsafe if
 
05:03:42.350 --> 05:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
we take away a parenting plan we have
 
05:03:44.390 --> 05:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
nothing to put it in place the parenting
 
05:03:47.030 --> 05:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
plan is designed for
 
05:03:49.788 --> 05:03:49.798 align:start position:0%
for protecting the kids
 
05:03:49.798 --> 05:03:50.350 align:start position:0%
for protecting the kids
um

05:03:50.350 --> 05:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:53.750 --> 05:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
I think the only way to you're right
 
05:03:55.910 --> 05:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
that that we have problems with with
 
05:03:58.970 --> 05:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
bottlenecking in the courts but the only
 
05:04:01.490 --> 05:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
way through that is to get more judges
 
05:04:04.750 --> 05:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
we you know we need
 
05:04:06.708 --> 05:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
deregulating isn't going to solve it
 
05:04:08.570 --> 05:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
it's going to cause more problems in the
 
05:04:09.708 --> 05:04:09.718 align:start position:0%
long run which is going to make more
 
05:04:11.510 --> 05:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
people have to go back to court for
 
05:04:13.070 --> 05:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
different issues because they didn't
 
05:04:16.430 --> 05:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
have it in writing to begin with and
 
05:04:18.470 --> 05:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
we're creating more problems than we
 
05:04:21.110 --> 05:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:23.810 --> 05:04:23.820 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
05:04:26.990 --> 05:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative log thank you Mr chairman
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
I I um I mean I think I know the intent
 
05:04:31.970 --> 05:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
of this I mean after listening to Mr
 
05:04:34.970 --> 05:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
Collier I I empathize with him I I get
 
05:04:38.030 --> 05:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
it uh why is he
 
05:04:40.550 --> 05:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
why was it so long for him to get to
 
05:04:43.368 --> 05:04:43.378 align:start position:0%
visit his child that I don't understand
 
05:04:46.910 --> 05:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
and I get frustrated over that
 
05:04:49.910 --> 05:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
um I and I see where this would just get
 
05:04:53.448 --> 05:04:53.458 align:start position:0%
rid of that however it'd be just like um
 
05:04:56.390 --> 05:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
when I eat a cupcake with my diabetes it
 
05:04:59.208 --> 05:04:59.218 align:start position:0%
goes Skyrocket so I'm going to put in a
 
05:05:01.730 --> 05:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
bill to get rid of cupcakes
 
05:05:05.810 --> 05:05:05.820 align:start position:0%
you know it affects me and
 
05:05:09.288 --> 05:05:09.298 align:start position:0%
you know to get to the detail of the
 
05:05:12.110 --> 05:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
problem would be better I'd be more open
 
05:05:15.050 --> 05:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
to that to see if we can get a fix than
 
05:05:17.750 --> 05:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
just throw something blanket like this
 
05:05:20.090 --> 05:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
across where it's going to create other
 
05:05:20.100 --> 05:05:21.650 align:start position:0%
across where it's going to create other
issues

05:05:21.650 --> 05:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:05:25.310 --> 05:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I'll be uh
 
05:05:27.470 --> 05:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
in opposition
 
05:05:29.810 --> 05:05:29.820 align:start position:0%
I would put in a bill to eliminate
 
05:05:31.390 --> 05:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
diabetes but that's just me
 
05:05:34.490 --> 05:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford
 
05:05:36.590 --> 05:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:05:40.730 --> 05:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
um this is important to me because it
 
05:05:43.970 --> 05:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
was 20 years ago that I filed this
 
05:05:46.128 --> 05:05:46.138 align:start position:0%
for parenting plants it hadn't been
 
05:05:48.288 --> 05:05:48.298 align:start position:0%
heard of before New Hampshire all right
 
05:05:50.150 --> 05:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
something I picked up and saw in the
 
05:05:51.410 --> 05:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
state of Washington and brought it
 
05:05:51.420 --> 05:05:52.250 align:start position:0%
state of Washington and brought it
forward

05:05:52.250 --> 05:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:05:54.170 --> 05:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
when I when I presented I was pretty
 
05:05:55.730 --> 05:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
much laughed out of the
 
05:05:57.470 --> 05:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
out of the building
 
05:05:59.810 --> 05:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
and uh nobody was in favor of it at that
 
05:06:02.510 --> 05:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
time so but there was an attorney in the
 
05:06:04.070 --> 05:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
audience that heard me speak to it and
 
05:06:06.708 --> 05:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
his name was John Cameron he had come
 
05:06:07.910 --> 05:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
into family law left chemical
 
05:06:10.730 --> 05:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
engineering to do that after his divorce
 
05:06:14.570 --> 05:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
and uh we created another bill I believe
 
05:06:16.730 --> 05:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
was an amendment that created the family
 
05:06:19.430 --> 05:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
law task force which I highly recommend
 
05:06:21.530 --> 05:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
doing again
 
05:06:23.690 --> 05:06:23.700 align:start position:0%
um and we looked at all facets and we
 
05:06:26.330 --> 05:06:26.340 align:start position:0%
rewrote the family law statutes
 
05:06:28.610 --> 05:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
uh so and we took children out of the
 
05:06:31.190 --> 05:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
marriage path put it into its own place
 
05:06:32.868 --> 05:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
because not everybody that's married has
 
05:06:32.878 --> 05:06:34.430 align:start position:0%
because not everybody that's married has
children

05:06:34.430 --> 05:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:06:34.440 --> 05:06:35.030 align:start position:0%
children
um

05:06:35.030 --> 05:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:36.190 --> 05:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:06:39.830 --> 05:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
so we came back in 2005 and we got it
 
05:06:41.570 --> 05:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
passed and I see there's been a that
 
05:06:43.430 --> 05:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
section that you uh representative long
 
05:06:47.570 --> 05:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
spoke to uh is very important to father
 
05:06:47.580 --> 05:06:49.250 align:start position:0%
spoke to uh is very important to father
because

05:06:49.250 --> 05:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:06:49.260 --> 05:06:49.788 align:start position:0%
because
um

05:06:49.788 --> 05:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:52.610 --> 05:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
the old system was uh visitation
 
05:06:54.650 --> 05:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
and people viewed that as losing their
 
05:06:56.570 --> 05:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
parental rights
 
05:06:57.650 --> 05:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
um they want a parent they were
 
05:06:59.990 --> 05:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
Revisited to the children and we felt
 
05:07:03.470 --> 05:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
that the language needed to uh to change
 
05:07:06.288 --> 05:07:06.298 align:start position:0%
as because we didn't have
 
05:07:09.288 --> 05:07:09.298 align:start position:0%
parental rights and responsibilities
 
05:07:10.970 --> 05:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
it was
 
05:07:13.490 --> 05:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
custody or ownership
 
05:07:16.788 --> 05:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
and visitors and uh this is one of the
 
05:07:19.730 --> 05:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
biggest things we did so I'd be
 
05:07:21.770 --> 05:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
privileged to uh
 
05:07:23.868 --> 05:07:23.878 align:start position:0%
do the itl
 
05:07:26.590 --> 05:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
you anticipated my request
