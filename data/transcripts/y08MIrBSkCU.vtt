child support C
 
00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:03.959 align:start position:0%
calculation this is against uh federal

law and the apportionment process and
 
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:09.560 align:start position:0%

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
drained my finances as well as many
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
others who proudly sered but it has left
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
me paying
 
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
$1,275 a month in child support alone I
 
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
have spent years digging myself out of
 
00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:26.519 align:start position:0%
debt that seems to never be ending on
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
top of dealing with my
 
00:09:31.949 --> 00:09:31.959 align:start position:0%
disability and is exhausted I have job
 
00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
limitations due to the disabilities
 
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
being so severe and an inability to work
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
at times this leaves me relying on
 
00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:42.519 align:start position:0%
social security benefits to assist me
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
financially after my child support
 
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
obligations come out I receive
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
$411 a month to live on my mortgage and
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
that until the crippling effects of this
 
00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:03.079 align:start position:0%
Federal L illegal action ceases myself
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
as well as many other veterans who have
 
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
been stripped of our rights to doe
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
process will be forced to choose between
 
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
paying their bills or seeing their child
 
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
honestly being raised here our state has
 
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
is better than this our soldiers deserve
 
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
better and as far as the title 4D office
 
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
needing the money as was stated last
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
year I believe that counting illegal
 
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
funds in their budget to begin with
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%

for veterans that have served this
 
00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:14.839 align:start position:0%
country prior to you know and and to PR
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
preserve our freedom and way in life so
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'd also like to thank the
 
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
committee members for the opportunity to
 
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
express my thoughts and feelings and
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
also to hold a separate session um so we
 
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
did have time to do this um I'm just
 
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
going to briefly explain why I'm in
 
00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
composition to the bill as the language
 
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
states in the proposed Bill HB 317 seeks
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
to eliminate counting disabled veterans
 
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
income as gross income and when reading
 
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
the text of the two reference laws 42
 
00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:44.839 align:start position:0%
USC section 659 and IM
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
9803 HB 317 would dramatically change
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
the existing process for New Hampshire
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
in calculating child support when either
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
party is receiving disabled veteran
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
compensation essentially taking the
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
power out of the hands of the family
 
00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
court for resolving paid disparities and
 
00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:02.839 align:start position:0%
putting that burden directly on the
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of New Hampshire for example
 
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
if a 100% disabled veteran receives all
 
00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
of their income from the from the
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
government the other party would have to
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
seek aid from the state of New Hampshire
 
00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
instead in the way of tanif or similar
 
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
funds so I would put this question
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
before the committee do you believe it
 
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
is the responsibility of all New
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers to pay child support
 
00:14:28.509 --> 00:14:28.519 align:start position:0%
to the ex spouse of a disabled veteran
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
and so if the answer is no I would
 
00:14:31.949 --> 00:14:31.959 align:start position:0%
implore you to vote in expedient to
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
legislate on HB
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
317 so next the New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
Court has already ruled on this matter
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
just about a year ago on this EX in this
 
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
exact case in reference to in the matter
 
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
of Shawn bronstein and jerich bronstein
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court roundly
 
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
dismissed the case presented by Shawn
 
00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
bronstein who who also happens to be the
 
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
original author of HB 317 by referencing
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
existing precedent in both New Hampshire
 
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
and federal cases in essence the New
 
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court found no
 
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
existing laws whether federal or in the
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire meant to exempt
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
any compensation to Veterans from Child
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
Support I've already submitted this as
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
evidence to the committee for review and
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
support of these
 
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.949 align:start position:0%
support of these
statements

00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:17.959 align:start position:0%
statements
 
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%
so passage of the HB 317 would have an
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
adverse effect on New Hampshire
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
residents most directly those who
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
receive child support uh will find that
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
support disappear and because income
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
from all sources is considered when
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
calculating child support if the
 
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
ex-spouse of a disabled veteran happens
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
to be May making more than the vet it's
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
possible they would have to pay child
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
support to the disabled veteran however
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
by this logic people who make less would
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
see their support cut and those barely
 
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
making ends meet now may face dire
 
00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
repercussions so and when those people
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
have nowhere else to go they will
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
utilize New Hampshire Support Services
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
costing New Hampshire
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
lastly I have known Shawn bronstein for
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
many years Jerica Shan's ex-wife who
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
testified in the first hearing on this
 
00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
bill Mr Bolan this is not about Mr
 
00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
brunstein you're here to speak about the
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
bill I understand that um but basically
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get at is um that the
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
bill before this committee was written
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
in spite of the fact that he could not
 
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
get out of paying child support
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
and yes he is a disabled Mr Bolan I I
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
have to ask you you can't make those
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
statements about another person you're
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
here to speak about the bill and we'll
 
00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:42.759 align:start position:0%
decide whether the bill has Merit or not
 
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
not whether it was written in spite or
 
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
not okay I understand that um then I
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
will just at that point um I again
 
00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
restate that in New Hampshire state law
 
00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
um they did say in rejecting the
 
00:17:03.069 --> 00:17:03.079 align:start position:0%
argument that was brought before in Rose
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
V Rose um it is to reject the argument
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
that it's a federal law to pay to exempt
 
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:17.959 align:start position:0%
child support um by avoiding the
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
possibility of Veterans Administration
 
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
being placed in the position as a
 
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
collection agency and to prevent the
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
deprivation and depletion of the means
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
of substance to Veterans dependent upon
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
these benefits as the main source of
 
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:30.990 align:start position:0%
these benefits as the main source of
their

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
well um thank you for your time in
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
reviewing this bill uh my name is Shan
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
bronstein and I a disabled veteran and
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
retired federal employee you've recently
 
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from my ex-wife jerich
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
bronstein while I disagree with certain
 
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
aspects of her testimony it has come is
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
not seen as portraying an accurate view
 
00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:29.799 align:start position:0%
she has she
 
00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
Mr brunstein I would just ask that you
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
speak to the bill yes yes ma'am I am I I
 
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
I am stating
 
00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559 align:start position:0%
that I am not here to provide details of
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
my contentious divorce um but I am here
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
to bring Insight on how my rights were
 
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
impacted to address the elephant in the
 
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
room this bill is not about not wanting
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
to pay child support at no time did I or
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
any veteran refuse to pay child support
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
in particular the case which I filed
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
the um for the enforcement it was an
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
appeal that they would not enforce the
 
00:21:06.029 --> 00:21:06.039 align:start position:0%
order at child support unfortunately
 
00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
this was false after nearly 18 months of
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
asking the state of New Hampshire T Ford
 
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
agency to file an apportionment they
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
finally did file the apportionment but
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
they failed to file it correctly
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
Department of Veterans Affairs requested
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
them to provide the correct form
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the state and my ex-wife
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
did not provide this
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
information and when I asked him to
 
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
submit it again it was refused and it
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
was stated it was inappropriate and
 
00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:34.039 align:start position:0%
redundant to ask for a second request
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
how is this due process these documents
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
were submitted to you previously which
 
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
shows that the Department of Veterans
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
Affairs asked the state to complete the
 
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
apportionment process in which they have
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
not done
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
so this bill provides due process which
 
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
is protected under the Fifth Amendment
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
of the US Constitution and the 14th
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment of the New Hampshire
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
Constitution it puts New Hampshire back
 
00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
in line with the federal laws and it
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
provides a legitimate Avenue to seek a
 
00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
portion of federal benefits which are
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
protected many people have read the
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
decision from both the lower courts and
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire courts regarding my
 
00:22:09.149 --> 00:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
personal case but they did not take the
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
time to actually research the laws that
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
the both the courts pointed to for
 
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
example in the lower court the judge
 
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
stated she was following the current
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
state legislature that was produced this
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
is correct she refused to comment on
 
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
federal law the New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
Court used old Federal statutes
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
specifically 38311
 
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
a which was changed after the veteran
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
judicial review Act of 1988 to
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
38531 essentially the New Hampshire
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court cited Federal statutes
 
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
that are now considered vocational
 
00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation veterans are not asking
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
to not pay child support but they are
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
asking for your help to enforce
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
protection on their benefits with regard
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
to taking into consideration that many
 
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
of their injuries impact their daily
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
living and not everything is covered by
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
the VA the funds are protected and are
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
to be used for this purpose
 
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
that completes my testimony I've already
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have are there

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%

00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
to answer some of the um questions and
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
and essentially uh questions from anyone
 
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
that has any questions from the
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
committee I would really really be happy
 
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
to do that because I think it's always
 
00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
great with oral argument in court and as
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
well in these testimony situations when
 
00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
people ask questions we get a lot of
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
information out of that so I'll try to
 
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
be brief with the remainder of my
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
testimony and I want to respond to one
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
thing um regarding whether or not and to
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
what extent your recognition of
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
preemptive federal law would actually be
 
00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:26.919 align:start position:0%
a burden on taxpayers of the State of
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh statistically as we
 
00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
spoke last time nationally 70% of the
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
disabled veterans in the United States
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
of which there are five million or 70%
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
or greater disabled however there's only
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
approximately 3,500 disabled veterans in
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire uh of that
 
00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
amount uh I assure you if you were to
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
follow Federal statutes as the HB 317
 
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
request it would not be a burden on
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire taxpayers
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
whatsoever because federal law under the
 
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
provisions that were post 1987 which is
 
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
post Rose versus Rose the Congressional
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
statutes cited in my statement 42 USC
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
659 38 USC 5301 and the regulations that
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
are also cited provide through the
 
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
federal Appropriations process right
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
Federal money is appropriated by
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
Congress every single year for purposes
 
00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
of paying disabled veterans the
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
disability pay to which they are
 
00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
entitled and also to pay the dependence
 
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
of disabled veterans um for the support
 
00:26:35.549 --> 00:26:35.559 align:start position:0%
requirements that they have this is why
 
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
it's required to go to the VA to request
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
that they make an apportionment of these
 
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
benefits that they have appropriated
 
00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
through Federal taxpayer dollars to pay
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
to the disabled veterans and their
 
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
dependents all the HB 317 does is is
 
00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:52.919 align:start position:0%
defer which it has to under the veterans
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
judicial review act which again was
 
00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
passed post Rose versus Rose in 1988 to
 
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
the VA secretary for making those
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
determinations 38 USC 511 provides that
 
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
the VA has exclusive jurisdiction over
 
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
all questions of Law and of fact with
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
respect to claims for benefits by
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
dependence exclusive jurisdiction after
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
Rose Congress removed the concurrent
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that the state courts had
 
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
to make those determinations precisely
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
because it was economically burdensome
 
00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
on the federal government and the
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
Appropriations Provisions by Congress to
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
provide disabled veterans for the
 
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:34.360 align:start position:0%
benefits to which they are entitled so
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
federal law has these Provisions the
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
apportionment process 38 USC
 
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
5307 allows for the VA to apportion
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
benefits and pay those dependence
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
support uh orders and obligations that
 
00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:50.679 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to if they show a need
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
but that need has to be litigated
 
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
through the J the exclusive jurisdiction
 
00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
of the VA which is why it's set up that
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
way Congress even created a separate
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
article one court that is uh for all
 
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
appeals of these questions have to go
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
through that article one court it's the
 
00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:10.519 align:start position:0%
board of veterans appeals then the court
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
of claims then it's the federal circuit
 
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
and then it's the Supreme Court so if
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
there are any um issues which with a
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
denial of an apportionment claim then
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
article one federal court was created to
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
exclusively address those claims that's
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
important it's like a lot like
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy right when you have bankrupt
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
rupes the federal courts take exclusive
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over all questions of
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy state courts do not have a
 
00:28:37.509 --> 00:28:37.519 align:start position:0%
concurrent jurisdiction any longer and
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
that's the significance of the changes
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
that Congress made uh after Rose versus
 
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
Rose which again as I said last time did
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
previously as an anomaly hold that the
 
00:28:50.669 --> 00:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
states were not preempted and I think
 
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's important for the committee to
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
understand under the Constitutional
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
structure uh these laws that are passed
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
providing disability benefits are passed
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
pursuant to congress's enumerated
 
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
military powers under the Constitution
 
00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
and once that is done once that source
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
of law has been established and has been
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
numerous times by the United States
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and and United States
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
versus Oregon is one of the cases
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
mccardy versus mccardy Ridgeway uh Manel
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
versus Manel Howell versus Howell
 
00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
Hillman versus maretta numerous cases
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
throughout um the last 200 years have
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that the exercise by
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
Congress of its enumerated military
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
Powers is the source of law for these
 
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
disability benefits that are paid to
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
veterans that means that the supremacy
 
00:29:41.549 --> 00:29:41.559 align:start position:0%
clause preempts all state law that
 
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
stands in its way including judicial law
 
00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that the state of New
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or any other state supreme
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
court um disagrees I think that the
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
legislature of the state certainly has
 
00:29:57.389 --> 00:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
the authority to defer to the Congress
 
00:29:59.549 --> 00:29:59.559 align:start position:0%
which is the the federal legislature and
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
its enumerated Authority Under the
 
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the supremacy clause so
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
and I just want to assure everyone that
 
00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
there are Provisions for veterans and
 
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
the dependence of veterans to be uh
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
taken care of it just has to come from a
 
00:30:16.029 --> 00:30:16.039 align:start position:0%
regulated Authority that has the
 
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
exclusive jurisdiction to make that
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
determination otherwise you upset the
 
00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
balance Buchanan versus Alexander is a
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
case which uh really highlights this the
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
reasoning in that case behind the
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
deference that state courts owe to the
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
federal government when they are
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
addressing and dividing Federal
 
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
Appropriations must be adhered to
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise the federal government's
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
Authority and power would be uh
 
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
basically left to the discretion of 50
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
states and territories right so if the
 
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
states could come in and divide up these
 
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
monies as they saw fit in the manner in
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
which they believe they can um then it
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
would really throw um throw the uh the f
 
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
Appropriations process into disarray and
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
I believe if you read the plain language
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
of the statutes I've provided you will
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
see how this deference to the federal
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
Authority is set up and established and
 
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
structured under the
 
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution um so really that's all I
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
have to say in that regard uh Federal
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
preemption applies the state has the
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
discretion and Authority certainly to um
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
make sure that it that the state of New
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is in line with federal law
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
and preemptive federal law under the the
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution and um you know to the
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
extent that uh Howell versus Howell
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
which is the 2017 Supreme Court case on
 
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
unanimous opinion in which I wrote the
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
amikas brief for Veterans of Foreign
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
Wars uh was completely and 100%
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
consistent with not only Rose versus
 
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
Rose but also the current status of
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
these Federal statutes it basically said
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
the states remain free to take account
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
of the fact that some military
 
00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
retirement pay and dis ility retirement
 
00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
pay might be U divided by and between
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
the former spouse and the military a
 
00:32:06.509 --> 00:32:06.519 align:start position:0%
former military service member through
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
purposes in in either child support
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
alimony or property right but it has to
 
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
be established by the federal statutes
 
00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
and that's very significant because I I
 
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
would like for the committee also to
 
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
understand something very important you
 
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
know in the percentages of disabled
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
veterans these days a lot of people I
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
think 10 20 years ago look at veterans
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
and say okay that's a retired veteran he
 
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
or she spent 20 or more years as a
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
service member they have a full-fledged
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
basic retirement pension and they might
 
00:32:36.509 --> 00:32:36.519 align:start position:0%
have some disability the types of
 
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
benefits that we're talking about are
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
100% pure disability pay they're not
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits 90 uh 90% of the
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
veterans that are disabled that come
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
have that are present right now in the
 
00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
United States are not of those who have
 
00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
retired they're not retirees they don't
 
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
even have a retirement pension a
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
disability retirement pension and again
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
it's a bit confusing sometimes because
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
these these these Provisions um that are
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
established by federal law the
 
00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:05.720 align:start position:0%
percentages that are out there it's
 
00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:06.679 align:start position:0%
difficult because some of these
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
categories are hard to understand but
 
00:33:12.909 --> 00:33:12.919 align:start position:0%
100% pure VA disability R uh I'm sorry
 
00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
VA disability pay is not retirement pay
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with retirement pay
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
at all it's a disability compensation
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
that's paid to the veteran as a result
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
of their service connected disabilities
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not they uh had
 
00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:29.240 align:start position:0%
enough years in service to retire it's
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
completely different fund and that's why
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
it has to be sequestered and that's why
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
the VA retains exclusive Authority and
 
00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
final jurisdictional control over the
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
disposition of those benefits and the
 
00:33:42.669 --> 00:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
states frankly are just not respecting
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
that and that's the challenge we had in
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
Howell I mean Howell the US Supreme
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
Court overturned 30 years of state court
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
case law that was um was being um
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
adjudicated that was contrary to Federal
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
statutes and federal law and it I'm not
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
surprised I mean I'm not surprised that
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
we're in this situation today with
 
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
respect to the child support and the
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
spousal support because the states
 
00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
generally are going to adjudicate this
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
in a manner that they believe is
 
00:34:13.069 --> 00:34:13.079 align:start position:0%
favorable uh but in fact is contrary to
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
federal law and it just is the reality
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
so um you know it's a state-by-state
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
battle essentially and I do think the
 
00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
legislature has the authority the power
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
and the ability to go and look at these
 
00:34:26.669 --> 00:34:26.679 align:start position:0%
Federal statutes to recognize the
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
hierarchy of authority and control under
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
the supremacy clause and to uh to abide
 
00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
by the supremacy clause and the federal
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
statutes that are on the books that
 
00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
again are post Rose versus Rose 1987
 
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
Rose versus Rose has been legislatively
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
abrogated by the federal statute which
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
means that they must be respected
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
regardless of what um the US Supreme
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
Court said in
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
1987 so if there's any questions I'd be
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them again I think
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
that's very uh fruitful if if there are
 
00:34:59.790 --> 00:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
if not um um close my testimony thank
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
you so much for having
 
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
me thank you are there any questions
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
from Mr
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
Tucker representative
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
long thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Tucker uh are you of any other
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
state that has this
 
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
um this uh benefit this waiver of Child
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
Support so there are some statutes in
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
some states that recognize uh
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
that they must abide by the federal
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
statutes so yes the Texas for example if
 
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
you look at um and I don't have the
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
references to the precise statutes but
 
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
some of the state statutes say they must
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
abide by the federal law which Rich
 
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
which essentially defers to the Defense
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
Finance and Accounting Service to pay
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
directly to the forer spouse and or the
 
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
dependant the amount of money to which
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
they are entitled and again this if it
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
comes from the federal um def defas
 
00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
right defense Finance and Accounting
 
00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
Service they will only pay that to which
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
the former spouse or the dependents are
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
entitled and that's fine that's how it
 
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
should be because the VA knows and
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
determines uh you know what benefits are
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
available to dependents and to the
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
veterans and to the veterans former
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
spouses um and as far but there's none
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
so there's no other um can I can I have
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
a followup followup representative yeah
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh so I'm not
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
hearing a yes so I'm going to take it as
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
a no uh the second question I have is
 
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
with respect to service connected
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
disability the uh dependent compensation
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
would that also be
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
waved uh with respect to
 
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
317 when you say waved I think 317
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
defers to the federal government to
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
request from the VA the the amount of
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
apportionment of those benefits that
 
00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
should be paid to the dependent so I I'm
 
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
not sure what you mean by way
 
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
representative long uh that would not be
 
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
included in in the calculation of Child
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
Support HB 317 would defer to the VA to
 
00:37:15.309 --> 00:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
determine through the apportionment
 
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
process as it should what benefits are
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
being paid to the veteran should be a
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
available or made available to the um
 
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
the former spouse and or the dependents
 
00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
now remember the federal law 42 USC 659
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
H1B um 2 I'm sorry H1 a25 and H1 B3 42
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
USC USC
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
659 uh defines what is income and what
 
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
is not income and h12 A5 actually
 
00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
defines uh what is income and what the
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
federal government will count as income
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
for purposes of child support and
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
spousal support payments that's already
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
established by federal law that's why if
 
00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
you defer to the VA and defas as to what
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
is available they will see that
 
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
recognize it and pay it over pursuant to
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
a court order uh under H1 B3 however the
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
amounts that we're talking about the
 
00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:14.839 align:start position:0%
pure VA disability pay uh 100%
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
disability payments compensation are
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
excluded they're not counted as income
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
so the federal government and the VA to
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
which it should be the Deferred
 
00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
Authority uh deferred to um would not
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
pay that thank you yeah 31 you very much
 
00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.670 align:start position:0%
pay that thank you yeah 31 you very much

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
representative liy you have to have a
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
question oh I'm sorry my question to you
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
is I am just curious when we are talking
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
about these child support obligations
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
are these children any child born to
 
00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
this veteran or is this any child that
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
is born prior to the disability or does
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
it also include any children born after
 
00:39:29.359 --> 00:39:31.150 align:start position:0%
it also include any children born after
the

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
disability so the veterans have an
 
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
obligation to report and record the
 
00:39:40.589 --> 00:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
quote unquote qualified dependence that
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
they have and that they obviously rely
 
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
upon the federal government and the VA
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
to determine the benefit structure and
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
the amount of payments they should get
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
so it applies to anyone that's a
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
qualified defined dependent under
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
federal law if a veteran has an a you
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
know a a child whether it's uh out of
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
wedlock or from a marriage um a minor
 
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
child or a quote unquote qualified
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
dependent they are going to report that
 
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
to the um federal government they're
 
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
required to by law I hope that answers
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
your question it would include any
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
dependent of a veteran service connected
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
dis disabled veteran or a retiree or any
 
00:40:22.349 --> 00:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
veteran service member or any service
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
member actually Madam chair may I follow
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
up follow up thank you um Mr Tucker my
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
question is not whether or not a child
 
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
is out of wedlock I feel that that is
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to the topic my question is
 
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not this child was born after
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
this veteran knew that they were
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
receiving disability
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
benefits yes the child would be included
 
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
as a quote unquote dependent of the
 
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
veteran if it's a child of the veteran I
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
I wasn't I didn't mean to make a
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
distinction I'm just what I mean is the
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
dependant or minor children born to the
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
veterans um or considered dependents and
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to uh benefits the
 
00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839 align:start position:0%
veterans have the obligation but in fact
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's they're incentivized to report
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
their dependence to the to the VA so
 
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
they're all there's no you know there's
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
no um reason to exclude
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
them thank you very much are there any
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
other questions for Mr Tucker
 
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.910 align:start position:0%
other questions for Mr Tucker
representative

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:32.349 --> 00:41:32.359 align:start position:0%
lii uh thank you Mr
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
Tucker um I assume that you understand
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
our dilemma these children have to be
 
00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
taken care of and we cannot make
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
distinctions in law between uh one child
 
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:43.720 align:start position:0%
and another which uh they have to be
 
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
supported and so how are we going to
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
support them and how are we going to
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
have one law for all of the people in
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
this state so this is my experience and
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
I'm very happy to answer that because my
 
00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
experience with pre-divorce or or
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
current uh family law matters throughout
 
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
the states is this we approach the um
 
00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
the judge and the former spouse we
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
provide them with the forms that are
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
required by the VA to be filled out to
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
request the apportionment of Mr Tucker
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
we we understand the process but just
 
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
directly answer his question I'm
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
answering it so the VA will make the
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
determination and it works through that
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
process it's a 317 requires the courts
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
to request the apportionment the
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
apportionment will provide the
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
dependence with the support that they're
 
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
required to to to to have according to
 
00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
the the calculations of the VA so yeah I
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
mean there's there's provision for it
 
00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:38.839 align:start position:0%
it's in the bill and I think it
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
certainly needs to um to be understood
 
00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
that that bill uh references that it
 
00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
defers to the VA and there are
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
Provisions for dependence to be taken
 
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
care of so it's not like you're
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
excluding them 100% altogether by virtue
 
00:42:56.549 --> 00:42:56.559 align:start position:0%
of this bill uh it the process actually
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
works uh we've seen it
 
00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.069 align:start position:0%
works uh we've seen it
work

00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
followup are there any more questions
 
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.510 align:start position:0%
followup are there any more questions
representative

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
Banger uh thank you madam chair uh Mr
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
Tucker you stated that there was only a
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
small portion of disabled veterans in
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can you provide to this
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
committee the possible number of those
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
disabled veterans who are affected by a
 
00:43:26.549 --> 00:43:26.559 align:start position:0%
child support payment yeah so I I don't
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
have that EX exact number but you can
 
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
imagine that the subset of the disabled
 
00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:32.839 align:start position:0%
veterans population in New Hampshire is
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
that are affected by this is actually
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
probably percentage wise small which is
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
sort of good and sort of bad right it's
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunate because we don't get a lot
 
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
of attention um because in each case in
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
each state uh some states like Florida
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
Colorado California have a huge number
 
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
of veterans uh disabled veterans but but
 
00:43:53.309 --> 00:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
we're talking about New Hampshire and I
 
00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
believe that you answered his question
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much Mr
 
00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
everyone up next is Warren Perry who has
 
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
asked for 10 minutes Mr Perry could you
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
please State who you are where you're
 
00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
from and who you are representing and
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not you have written
 
00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you madam chair my name
 
00:44:32.549 --> 00:44:32.559 align:start position:0%
is Warren Perry I'm the deputy agitant
 
00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
general for New Hampshire's Department
 
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
of military Affairs and veteran services
 
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
I am located in my office in conquered I
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
did support I did submit written
 
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
testimony uh I I would like to start by
 
00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
saying you know based on our extensive
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
research uh well actually let me back up
 
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know our the charge of the
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
department is to support service members
 
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
veterans and their families uh and we
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
take that that responsibility very very
 
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
seriously uh and we understand the uh uh
 
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
the ex the importance of this bill and
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
having good honest debate about uh the
 
00:45:11.549 --> 00:45:11.559 align:start position:0%
bill on both sides the department is not
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
taking a position rather our intent is
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
just to educate you based on our
 
00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
research and our understanding of the
 
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
issue based on our research uh we have
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
determined that New Hampshire's
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
consideration of VA disability payments
 
00:45:26.549 --> 00:45:26.559 align:start position:0%
as part of gross income when determining
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
the amount of child support is fully
 
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
compliant with federal
 
00:45:33.549 --> 00:45:33.559 align:start position:0%
law VA disability benefits are
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
compensation for the veterans impaired
 
00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559 align:start position:0%
earning Camp uh cap capacity and is
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
intended to support the veteran and
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
their family so from that regard we can
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
determine that it's it should be counted
 
00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
as gross income when determining child
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
support payments you heard some
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
testimony previously from representative
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
Graham and in his written testimony he
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
put a schedule of payments that that uh
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
described both with dependent and
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
without dependent
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
rates uh in terms of the payment uh
 
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
benefits to Veterans with their
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
disability passing this law would uh
 
00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%
would therefore exclude the intended
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
purpose right the with dependent rate
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
part of that since it's included
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
intended for the family this law would
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
effectively exclude the calculation of
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
child support payments uh those VA dis
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
ility benefits that are intended for the
 
00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.950 align:start position:0%
ility benefits that are intended for the
family

00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
so uh you know again we reassert that
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
we're fully compliant with federal law
 
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
and the disability payments for veterans
 
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
with dependence is intended to support
 
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
the veteran and the family we know this
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
is a again an emotional issue you're
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
going to hear terms like disabled
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
veterans we certainly appreciate the
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
sacrifice that all veterans have made
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
you'll hear terms like child support
 
00:46:58.589 --> 00:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
what a veteran is and disability rating
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
there should be a distinction made
 
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
between a disabled veteran and a
 
00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
disability rating uh in my written
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
testimony I point out that there are
 
00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:07.640 align:start position:0%
some currently serving members of the
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire National Guard who have a
 
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
100% disability rating but it doesn't
 
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
mean necessarily that they're disabled
 
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
the intent the impact of this law would
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
be to exclude that person who is still
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh living a uh uh a meaningful active
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
life from these payments
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
right so or from the calculation of
 
00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
child support in these
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
payments so again I think it's it's uh
 
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate Mr Tucker's testimony
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's clear that we need to
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
continue to separate uh the issue of
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
alimony or ex spousal support and child
 
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
support the law is pretty clear about ex
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
spousal support and defines dependent as
 
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
a family member the ex spouse is no
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
longer a family member or dependent
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
therefore the disability payment is
 
00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
excluded in that alimony piece but it's
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
still absolutely compliant with federal
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
law to include disability payments
 
00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
when uh uh considering child
 
00:48:14.109 --> 00:48:14.119 align:start position:0%
support uh the apportionment process is
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh to my mind our is is our
 
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
understanding of the apportionment
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
process is that is a is a form of
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
redress for the affected
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
parent uh or the affected child it's not
 
00:48:28.589 --> 00:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
intended to be the
 
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
process uh apportionment occurs or is uh
 
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
you know a person is eligible for the
 
00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
apportionment process so when an
 
00:48:40.109 --> 00:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
obligation is not being met so
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
eliminating the
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
obligation would would almost certainly
 
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
eliminate eliminate uh the right to a
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
portion so if there's no court order
 
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
ordering the child support there would
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
be no basis for making an apportionment
 
00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
claim so I know it's it's a it's a
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
complicated process but that's that is
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
our understanding of this uh so and and
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
again this bill is not really about a
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
portion apportionment is a process that
 
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
occurs when uh when an obligation is not
 
00:49:17.549 --> 00:49:17.559 align:start position:0%
being met so you know there has to be an
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
obligation to pay child support before
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
the abortion process can
 
00:49:22.079 --> 00:49:23.750 align:start position:0%
the abortion process can
start

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh I would say I don't envy the uh uh
 
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
the position that the the the committee
 
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
is in and I appreciate their considered
 
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know they're they're passionate
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
and considered opinion uh when they when
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
they choose to vote uh on this
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
bill but you have to you know our
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
position is we are federal law and Court
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
precedent make it absolutely clear that
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's permissible for the state to
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
include veterans disability payments
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
when calculating child
 
00:49:55.789 --> 00:49:55.799 align:start position:0%
support I want you to understand that VA
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
disability payments
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
as uh as cited in court precedent are
 
00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:03.559 align:start position:0%
you know and they cite the intent of
 
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
Congress that those payments are made
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
for the family and the veteran not just
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
veteran alimon and uh alimony or ex
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
espousal support and child support are
 
00:50:15.119 --> 00:50:16.789 align:start position:0%
espousal support and child support are
separate

00:50:16.789 --> 00:50:16.799 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
issues Rose versus Rose is clear Court
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
precedent and it remains current today
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
in fact uh you know part of uh
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
part of the the court case of Mr
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
bronstein and if if you would just
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
indulge me for a second I'd like to read
 
00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
you just the passage with regard to
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
Howell versus how you heard testimony
 
00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.470 align:start position:0%
Howell versus how you heard testimony
early

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
early
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
about and it and I'm quoting from the
 
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
brunstein case and it says husband is
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
also M mistaken to the extent that he
 
00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:47.559 align:start position:0%
argues how versus
 
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
Howell uh abrogated Rose or or
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
overturned Rose how will address the
 
00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
treatment of the division of military
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
benefits as property and a divorce not
 
00:50:59.950 --> 00:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
as income to support the Veteran's
 
00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:03.160 align:start position:0%
dependence Howell did not address the
 
00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
calculation of a veteran's income for
 
00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
child support
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
purposes and then it goes on to say
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
nothing in Howell Alters Rose are the
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
holding and Rose that military
 
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
disability benefits are not required to
 
00:51:17.789 --> 00:51:17.799 align:start position:0%
be excluded from the definition of
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
income for the purpose of calculating
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
resources a party can draw on to fulfill
 
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
child support
 
00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
obligations so if uh and again I don't
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
want to to rehear brunstein that's not
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
my intent or rehear Rose I just want to
 
00:51:35.789 --> 00:51:35.799 align:start position:0%
say that was the decision and we
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
generally follow the decision of the
 
00:51:39.549 --> 00:51:39.559 align:start position:0%
courts when they rule on matters of law
 
00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh I would like to just address the fact
 
00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:50.200 align:start position:0%
that we did some research on other
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
states uh and we found that of the 50
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
states no State expressly excluded the
 
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
inclusion of veterans disability and the
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
calculation of child support in fact 29
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
States including New Hampshire expressly
 
00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.230 align:start position:0%
States including New Hampshire expressly
include

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
them 14 States uh include the disability
 
00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:14.440 align:start position:0%
benefits generally but not expressly
 
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
include them and it was not addressed in
 
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
eight states so there are no States
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
right now that are currently not
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
calculating uh veterans disability
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
benefits when we're determining gross
 
00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
support and uh I will just uh I did
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
submit my written testimony I hope that
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
you had an opportunity to review it I'm
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much so I have
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
um like two questions and bear with me
 
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
because I I don't know a lot about this
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
but so whose responsibility is it to
 
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
apply for an
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
apportionment the affected parent or the
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
affected party
 
00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
so it's not the state of New Hampshire
 
00:53:02.789 --> 00:53:02.799 align:start position:0%
or the division of child support my
 
00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is the initiation of the
 
00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
apportionment process starts with the
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
affected parent and is assisted by the
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
Bureau of uh uh child services at uh at
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh I'm not an expert on that on how
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
it the process initiates I know that
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
Karen Hebert is going to testify uh
 
00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
sometime this morning and she may be
 
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
able to answer that question more in a
 
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
more detailed manner thank you and just
 
00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
one more thing so this bill does not
 
00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
force the state to request an
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
apportionment is that
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
correct I I don't I don't see that in
 
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
there I think the effect of this bill
 
00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
ma'am is to eliminate disability
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
payments within the calculation of for
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
child support is gross income for child
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
support I don't see any part of this
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
bill that would have the effect of uh uh
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
of requiring the state to request a
 
00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
apportionment uh I just think it would
 
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
be and and I think it would be a process
 
00:54:03.309 --> 00:54:03.319 align:start position:0%
that would be arduous it would be
 
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
another step in the process you know my
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of the issue is that the
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
federal government really defers to the
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
States on a matter of family law and uh
 
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
you know trying to put the federal
 
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
government in that process is is a
 
00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
little bit awkward to to my way of
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
thinking I mean after I served for 28
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
years in the Army and you know we have
 
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
rules about child support and other
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
things and making sure that soldiers are
 
00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:30.799 align:start position:0%
meeting their obligations when they're
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
still serving and again the military
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
prefers to let the that be a process
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
between the parties or the courts so you
 
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
know I don't I don't see this law as you
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
know is is giving a requirement to the
 
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
states to do
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
apportionment I see it more as a fact
 
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
that we're just going to exclude the
 
00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
disability payments from the calculation
 
00:54:56.829 --> 00:54:56.839 align:start position:0%
of gross income
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
00:55:04.109 --> 00:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
Banger thank you madam chair uh Mr Perry
 
00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
uh question for you sir obviously in
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
regards to payments when a soldier um is
 
00:55:10.799 --> 00:55:12.549 align:start position:0%
regards to payments when a soldier um is
considered

00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:12.559 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
disabled and there is obviously a
 
00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
calculation as to how much this um
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
disabled v may receive per dependent um
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
is that taken into consideration when
 
00:55:28.349 --> 00:55:28.359 align:start position:0%
making child support payments for
 
00:55:31.789 --> 00:55:31.799 align:start position:0%
example if a child's payment is is if
 
00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
each if the veteran is receiving aund
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to pull a random number
 
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
here $9 per
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
dependent is that um is is that disabled
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
veteran uh paying more than that $19
 
00:55:49.029 --> 00:55:49.039 align:start position:0%
from child support payments thank thank
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
you for your question I'm going to
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
clarify it so what you're asking is is
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
the difference between the dependent
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
rate and the without without dependent
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
rate the only thing considered in the
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
gross income can you clarify that that's
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
your question pretty much yeah so the
 
00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
answer is the it'll be the gross income
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
I believe so the C the calculation for
 
00:56:10.589 --> 00:56:10.599 align:start position:0%
child support and again the folks Karen
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
Heber can answer the question better but
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
it's gross income so the entire
 
00:56:17.549 --> 00:56:17.559 align:start position:0%
disability payment would be considered
 
00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
as the gross income and then the
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
percentage of that based on the formulas
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
uh that are that are made by the state
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
would be the amount of payment that
 
00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
would be uh determined the amount of
 
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
child support payment that would be
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions from
 
00:56:35.839 --> 00:56:37.470 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions from
Mr

made in order for child support in New
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is determined using the New
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire child support guidelines and
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
that is under statutory Authority the
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire guidelines statute defines
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
gross income very broadly as all income
 
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
from any Source whether earned or
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
unearned which language follows federal
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
child support
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
regulation the federal child support
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
regulation is a requirement in the child
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
support state plan which is subject to
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
Federal audit and which the state is
 
00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
currently in compliance
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
with this federal child support
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
regulation requires that the state's
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
child support guidelines must provide
 
00:58:35.309 --> 00:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
that the child support order is based on
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
the obligor parents earnings income and
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
other evidence of ability to pay that
 
00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
takes into consideration all earnings
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
and income of the obligor parent
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
basically the state must comply with all
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
federal regulations in the state plan in

00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
relies on federal funding and federal
 
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
resources that provide critical data and

00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
to successfully serve families without
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
this funding and resources New Hampshire
 
00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
receives approximately 11.8 million each
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
year from the federal government which
 
00:59:31.549 --> 00:59:31.559 align:start position:0%
pays for over 2third of the cost of the

state
 
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
program the federal government also
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
provides data to the state for example
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
Federal new hire information it provides
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
direct support and resources to our
 
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
employer community and it provides the
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
treasury offset program which is a major
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
source of Child Support collected for
 
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
families which was in fiscal year 20
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
$13.6 million
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire courts also receive
 
01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:02.839 align:start position:0%
federal title for defunding to establish

establishment of child support orders
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
with this funding and resources the
 
01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
state is effectively able to collect
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
over $80 million each year for
 
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
approximately 40,000
 
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
children at present the state is in

compliance with the federal law and
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
regulation as determined by the federal
 
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
government and is evident by the fact
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
the state continues to receive title 4D
 
01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
Federal funding and access to those
 
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:37.240 align:start position:0%

determination of Child Support Awards
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
would also subject the state to other
 
01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:45.640 align:start position:0%
Federal sanctions which are fiscal
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
penalties of up to $1.9
 
01:00:51.029 --> 01:00:51.039 align:start position:0%

01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:53.839 align:start position:0%
state's tanith block grant as long as
 
01:00:56.029 --> 01:00:56.039 align:start position:0%
the state is not in compliance with the
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
Federal Authority if this bill passes
 
01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
the state will not be in compliance and
 
01:01:04.109 --> 01:01:04.119 align:start position:0%
will risk the penalty
 
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
assessment the amount of child support
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
in certain cases will decrease if this
 
01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
bill is passed which will results in
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
more families relying on public
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
assistance as was mentioned in earlier
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
testimony this creates a greater burden
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
on assistance programs in the state and
 
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.910 align:start position:0%
on assistance programs in the state and
on

01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers excluding veteran disability
 
01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
benefits from gross income will also
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
negatively impact the Department's
 
01:01:34.029 --> 01:01:34.039 align:start position:0%
ability to recover Public Assistance
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
expenditures in cases where child
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
support is assigned to the department
 
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
this is an important responsibility of
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
the child support
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
program the passing of this bill would
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately reduce the amount of child
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
receive the bill would be particularly
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
impactful on recipient families whose
 
01:01:58.349 --> 01:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
come is below the poverty level and for
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
whom child support is often most if not
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
their only source of income according to
 
01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
a 2018 study in New
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I ask that you consider the
 
01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
following veterans with child dependence
 
01:02:16.589 --> 01:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
who have a disability rating of 60% or
 
01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
less receive a benefit amount that is
 
01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
less than the guidelines current
 
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
self-support Reserve amount if this is a
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
veteran's sole source of income
 
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:29.839 align:start position:0%
the child support obligation is $50 a
 
01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:33.559 align:start position:0%
month which is the statutory minimum
 
01:02:35.789 --> 01:02:35.799 align:start position:0%
however veterans with child dependents
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
who have a disability rating that is
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
greater than 60% would receive a monthly
 
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
benefit amount greater than the
 
01:02:45.069 --> 01:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
self-support reserve amount and thus be
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
liable for support in New Hampshire laws
 
01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
and the current
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
guidelines for
 
01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
example the guideline self-support
 
01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
Reserve is presently one
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
$1,223 a
 
01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
month let's assume that the sole income
 
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
of the veteran is the Veteran's
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
disability benefit for the veteran with
 
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
children and let's just say that their
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
benefit is at a 100% disability rate
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
their benefit amount would be
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
$3,263 74 a
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
month under the current
 
01:03:24.029 --> 01:03:24.039 align:start position:0%
guidelines the amount for the family of
 
01:03:28.109 --> 01:03:28.119 align:start position:0%
Child Support award would be $668 a
 
01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
month under the proposed Bill the
 
01:03:34.589 --> 01:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
guidelines amount would be $50 a
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
month if this bill passes children whose
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
veteran parent is earning an amount
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
greater than the self-support reserve
 
01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:44.039 align:start position:0%
would lose the financial support they
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
would otherwise receive under the
 
01:03:45.599 --> 01:03:47.750 align:start position:0%
would otherwise receive under the
current

01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
statute the calculation of Child Support
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
is the target subject of this bill which
 
01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
is separate and distinct from federal
 
01:03:57.069 --> 01:03:57.079 align:start position:0%
and state Authority on
 
01:03:58.990 --> 01:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
garnishment the federal and state
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
Authority and case law on child support
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
garnishment state that while veterans
 
01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
disability benefits are exempt from
 
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
garnishment directly to the VA once
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
these funds are received by the veteran
 
01:04:16.029 --> 01:04:16.039 align:start position:0%
they can be used to satisfy a state's
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
order of Child
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
Support there is an exception to the
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
garnishment through the vet through the
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
VA that is provided for in federal
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
policy guidance that was released after
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
Federal memorandum in
 
01:04:33.549 --> 01:04:33.559 align:start position:0%
1998 that was issued by the
 
01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
administration for Children and Families
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
it includes instructions to States on
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
how to send an income withholding
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
garnishment to the
 
01:04:45.789 --> 01:04:45.799 align:start position:0%
VA including veterans disabilities and
 
01:04:48.029 --> 01:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
the definition of gross income to both
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
determine a support obligation amount
 
01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
and to satisfy a support obligation are
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
absolutely Allowed by federal law and in
 
01:04:59.269 --> 01:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
accordance with federal and state case
 
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
law so how do we help veterans
 
01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
now the Department of Health and Human
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
Services looks for ways to engage with
 
01:05:11.309 --> 01:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
and work with parents including veterans
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
who want to support their children but
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
are experiencing barriers to comply with
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
the Court's order in other words paying
 
01:05:20.109 --> 01:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
their child
 
01:05:22.269 --> 01:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
support the department is currently
 
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
helping these parents using a variety of
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
methods in including Outreach activities
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
and intervention services and connecting
 
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
them with resources that may be
 
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
available to them the department uses a
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
debt reduction program to help address
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
unmanageable past due child support it
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
also takes steps to ensure the parent
 
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
support order is Right sized and based
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
on their ability to
 
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
pay when any obligor parent does not
 
01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
have the ability to pay the bureau can
 
01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
at their request review their
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
court-ordered amount and the
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
circumstances that are impacting their
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
ability to pay if the circumstance
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
warrants an adjustment of their court
 
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
ordered amount the bureau can take it to
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
court for them and request that the
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
amount be recalculated based on their
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
actual income for example if the
 
01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
original order was issued based on
 
01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
earnings several years ago while in
 
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
active duty at a higher rate of pay but
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
now the veteran is earning let's say
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
$1,000 a month and benefits then the
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
order should be adjusted in accordance
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
with the current guideline
 
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
statute it is the Department's
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
experience that many paying parents are
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
not aware they can change their order or
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
they don't know how to or they cannot
 
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
afford the court filing fee we can we
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
can and do help them with this at no
 
01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
cost these services are available to
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
Veterans and if a veteran does not have
 
01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
a case with the bureau
 
01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
he or she can contact us and apply for
 
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
services even if their order was issued
 
01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
in another state or even if their order
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
was issued in another country we can
 
01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
help them if this bill passes the state
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
will be at risk of not being able to Pro
 
01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
to provide these kinds of services that
 
01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
many parents in addition to Veterans
 
01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
need thank you for giving me this
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
time thank you very much um I just have
 
01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
a quick
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
question if a parent doesn't initiate
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
the apportionment process does the
 
01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
division do that or what happens with
 
01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
that if if a parent is refusing to start
 
01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.109 align:start position:0%
that if if a parent is refusing to start
that

01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
process thank you Madame chairwoman for
 
01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
your question it's a good question and
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
there's been um some um a little bit of
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
confusion with respect to apportionment
 
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
and that particular
 
01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
process um apportionment does not
 
01:07:58.510 --> 01:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
replace child
 
01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
support if the receiving parent in our
 
01:08:04.589 --> 01:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
case in the world of child support the
 
01:08:07.829 --> 01:08:07.839 align:start position:0%
recipient of Child Support requests
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
assistance from the bureau to file a
 
01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
claim of apportionment with the V with
 
01:08:18.030 --> 01:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
the VA we will file the claim with the
 
01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.269 align:start position:0%
the VA we will file the claim with the
recipient

01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
recipient
 
01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
parent um we have instructions that have
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
been issued by our federal office
 
01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
specifically on how to do that
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
um does does that answer your
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
question kind of I'm just thinking
 
01:08:38.829 --> 01:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
because the apportionment would add to
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
their income and give them money to be
 
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
able to pay this child support even if
 
01:08:45.149 --> 01:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
more would have to come out of their
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
gross income at least they would have
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
that little bit of extra so I'm just
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:58.269 --> 01:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
it it's entirely up to the recipient
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
parent to make that request um it
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
honestly we it's our experience in the
 
01:09:06.669 --> 01:09:06.679 align:start position:0%
department that we do not
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
receive that particular request I'm only
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
aware of one instance where we have
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
received that request and actually it
 
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
was not requested by the recipient
 
01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
parent it was requested by the paying
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
parent so it is not a commonly uh
 
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
requested um
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh not a common request and I don't I
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't have any information
 
01:09:36.269 --> 01:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
if the recipient parent initiates such
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
requests for apportionment to the VA
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
directly without the bureau's assistance
 
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
that is entirely
 
01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
possible okay thank you are there any
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%

3117 U my name is attorney Matthew Hayes
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
I'm an attorney with the Bureau of Child

Support Services and I have previously
 
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
submitted written
 
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
testimony I'd like to just start by
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
talking about the child support uh
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
process generally to give committee some
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
additional context um the Social
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
Security Act
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
4D P 4D requires that all states follow
 
01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
Federal rules and regulations when
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
establishing and enforcing child's cour
 
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
orders the Federal Law requires that all
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
states establish child sport guidelines
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of establishing those
 
01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
orders the New Hampshire's child support
 
01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
guidelines are cified in 4508 C and they
 
01:11:08.110 --> 01:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
establish a uniform system to determine
 
01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
child sport Awards the purpose of this
 
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
chapter is not only to ensure uniformity
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
in determining the amount of child
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
support but also to ensure that both
 
01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
parents share in that support
 
01:11:21.149 --> 01:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility for their children
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
according to their relative percentage
 
01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
of each parent's income
 
01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
there is a rebuttable presumption that
 
01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
the child support award calculated under
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
the guidelines is the correct amount of
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
child support but this presumption may
 
01:11:37.629 --> 01:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
be overcome and a state court May
 
01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
deviate from the guidelines when a party
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
shows uh by a preponderance of evidence
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
that the application of those guidelines
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
would be unjust or inappropriate because
 
01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances um there is included in
 
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
statute a special list or a
 
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
non-exclusive list of circumstances that
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
if raised by any party or the court the
 
01:12:05.229 --> 01:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
court shall consider in making an
 
01:12:07.709 --> 01:12:07.719 align:start position:0%
adjustment that departs from the
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
guidelines uh either downwards or
 
01:12:12.910 --> 01:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
upwards the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
01:12:15.629 --> 01:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
has interpreted special circumstances as
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
including only circumstances that are
 
01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:20.679 align:start position:0%
economic in nature and relate to the
 
01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
impact of a parent's Financial condition
 
01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
upon his or her ability to meet the
 
01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
child needs the trial the trial the
 
01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
trial court must consider any of these
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances in light of the best
 
01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
interests of the
 
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
child so with respect to feral law as a
 
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
director Heber already pointed out
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
Federal Law requires that the state use
 
01:12:49.229 --> 01:12:49.239 align:start position:0%
all forms of income and that those all
 
01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:51.159 align:start position:0%
forms of income be included in the child
 
01:12:51.159 --> 01:12:52.189 align:start position:0%
forms of income be included in the child
support

01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines um in accordance with Federal
 
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
Authority our statute uses a broad
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
definition of gross income and the New
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire guidelines specifically
 
01:13:04.189 --> 01:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
include veterans disability
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
benefits uh I think it's also important
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge that the New Hampshire
 
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has
 
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
confirmed the inclusion of veterans
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
disability benefits as income for child
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
support purposes and that that is
 
01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
consistent with federal law um veterans
 
01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
disability benefits as was already
 
01:13:25.149 --> 01:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
pointed out intended to provide
 
01:13:27.629 --> 01:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
reasonable and adequate compensation for
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
both veterans and their families uh the
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
brunstein case that was uh been cited a
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
few times is also cites a US Supreme
 
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
Court case Rose V rose in which
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
recognizing that military de Rose
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
recognizes that again the benefits are
 
01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
not provided to support the Venture
 
01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:51.400 align:start position:0%
alone that Congress clearly intended
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
veterans disability benefits to be used
 
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
in part for support veterans
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
dependence just like also to point out
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire Supreme Court in
 
01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
bronstein has squarely addressed many of
 
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
the issues that were raised previously
 
01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
today the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
01:14:11.550 --> 01:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
has found through its analysis that Rose
 
01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
has not been overruled and many other
 
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
state courts have come to the same
 
01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
conclusion many of those State Court
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
decisions are also included in the
 
01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.270 align:start position:0%
decisions are also included in the
bronsteen

01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
bronsteen
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
decision the committee should also be
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
aware that the obligor in the Bron Ste
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
case has appealed that decision to the
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court and the Supreme Court
 
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
has declined to hear that
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
case um I know that I've cided some
 
01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
things that were already discussed
 
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
previously so I will just uh I would
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
like to thank the committee for giving
 
01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:46.280 align:start position:0%

01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%

apportionment claims which I've been
 
01:16:44.629 --> 01:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
doing for over a
 
01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:46.760 align:start position:0%

you you have five minutes um I just

01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
to talk to the committee about the
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
apportionment process I've worked for
 
01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
the VA I've been defending veterans
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
against apportionment claims and also
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
applying for them on behalf of custodial
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
parents um the I also worked with the
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
the VA DC office um and I wanted to
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
explain what a veteran apportionment is
 
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
a veteran apportionment is a process in
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
which a in a in which a claim filed by
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
the custodial parent um the custodial
 
01:17:23.229 --> 01:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
parent request money be paid for the
 
01:17:25.709 --> 01:17:25.719 align:start position:0%
support of a dependent the apportionment
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
claims Were Meant to Be an additional
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
means of enforcement of Child Support
 
01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
not a substitute or relitigate of a
 
01:17:33.669 --> 01:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
divorce proceeding the VA has determined
 
01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
that VA disability is meant for the
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
support of the veteran and their
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
dependence as others have said and it's
 
01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
cited in almost every veteran law
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
decision from now decades back um VA
 
01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
General Council has stated that the
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
purpose of the apportionment is to
 
01:17:50.189 --> 01:17:50.199 align:start position:0%
effectuate the responsibility of the VA
 
01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
beneficiary to support the beneficiaries
 
01:17:56.590 --> 01:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
dependent both the VA the dod and all of
 
01:17:59.870 --> 01:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
the service branches state that the
 
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
parent regardless of service or status
 
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
is supposed to support their child um
 
01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
the VA has the right to determine the
 
01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
Veteran's obligation Mr Tucker had said
 
01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
that the VA has the right to determine
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
the Veteran's obligations but that's
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
actually not true because the VA
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
apportionment process actually relies on
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
the state process so what happens is the
 
01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
custodial parent will file a request for
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
apportionment and a general
 
01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
apportionment is granted Ed if the
 
01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
not essentially fulfilling their
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
obligation to support the child and if
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
the child doesn't live with the veteran
 
01:18:37.629 --> 01:18:37.639 align:start position:0%
um one of the issues that I've had with
 
01:18:41.310 --> 01:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
veterans is that they will the the
 
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
custodial parent will apply for an
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
apportionment claim and they will also
 
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
be fulfilling their child support
 
01:18:47.310 --> 01:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
obligations and then I have to go back
 
01:18:49.629 --> 01:18:49.639 align:start position:0%
and get that money back from the VA and
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
if there's no state court support order
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
in place it's going to make it
 
01:18:56.590 --> 01:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
existentially harder for me to defend
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
them from people who do that um the fact
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
that the apportionment process exists is
 
01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
because it's supposed to support the
 
01:19:07.870 --> 01:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
state process it's not supposed to
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
replace it um the same sentiment was
 
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
echoed by the Supreme Court in the Rose
 
01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
V Rose case which is not outdated how V
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
how Winer V Wisner and many of the other
 
01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
cases that Mr Tu Tucker had uh cited
 
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
specifically referenced alimony and
 
01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
divorce divorce proceedings where assets
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
are being divided child support is not
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
an asset um I agree that the once the
 
01:19:35.629 --> 01:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
the ex spouse is no longer a part of the
 
01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
family they're not entitled to support
 
01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
but the child still is and the veteran
 
01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
still has an obligation to do that
 
01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of their status um all of the
 
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
cases that he cited Wisner how they all
 
01:19:48.189 --> 01:19:48.199 align:start position:0%
specifically state that they're not in
 
01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
relation to child support the veteran
 
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
does have a duty to support defendants
 
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
and honestly if you take away Counting
 
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
child support or putting in a a court
 
01:19:59.709 --> 01:19:59.719 align:start position:0%
ordered support
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
obligation it makes it harder for me to
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
defend these guys when there are people
 
01:20:05.229 --> 01:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
who go and apply for an apportionment
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
claim because in certain States it's
 
01:20:09.629 --> 01:20:09.639 align:start position:0%
considered a separate stream of Revenue
 
01:20:11.229 --> 01:20:11.239 align:start position:0%
um I just had a case where I had to go
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
back and get almost $100,000 for a
 
01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
veteran where the ex had applied for an
 
01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
apportionment claim it had been granted
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
and they were paying all their support
 
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
obligations which I actually won that
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
case um but without being able to show
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
that there is an
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
adequate supply of money being given to
 
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
the custodial parent it's very difficult
 
01:20:33.790 --> 01:20:33.800 align:start position:0%
and then it's left up to the Judgment of
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
someone making that decision um and the
 
01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
VA has stated that
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
um an apportionment claim should consist
 
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
of 20% to 50% of um the total amount of
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
VA disability the state does
 
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
25% um I wouldn't want to go in and
 
01:20:56.830 --> 01:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
argue when I could get 25% in a state
 
01:21:00.149 --> 01:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
court versus going and losing half later
 
01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
that's a really hard thing for me to to
 
01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
try and and manage because it's very
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
very subjective
 
01:21:09.709 --> 01:21:09.719 align:start position:0%
um the supremacy clause that Mr Tucker
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
cited does state that federal law
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
supersedes state law but it also is very
 
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
clear that it doesn't involve election
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
processes divorce proceedings things
 
01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
like that because those are considered
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
the purview of the state and the VA
 
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
honestly does not want to be involved in
 
01:21:25.709 --> 01:21:25.719 align:start position:0%
litigating a divorce or determining a
 
01:21:27.149 --> 01:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
support amount that's not their role
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
they're not there to do that and they're
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
not a Judicial body so they can't really
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
make a determination like that legally
 
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
um as I stated um in my written
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
testimony there are no other states that
 
01:21:44.830 --> 01:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
have a law like this um and I've been
 
01:21:46.149 --> 01:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
working on apportionment claims as I
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
stated on both sides so I will close my
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
testimony I did submit written testimony
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
with more information but I would like
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
to open up to questions if anybody has
 
01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.910 align:start position:0%
to open up to questions if anybody has
any

01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
01:21:57.719 --> 01:22:00.390 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
Miss

01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
Ryan seeing none thank you very much for
 
01:22:06.910 --> 01:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank
 
01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
you okay so that's all I have on my list
 
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
for Testimony and I see no hands raised
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
so I will close the public hearing on HB
 
01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:24.709 align:start position:0%
so I will close the public hearing on HB
37

01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
then I will give the clerk a few minutes
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
and we will open the executive section
 
01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
section the executive session on HB 188
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
so I'll wait for the clerk to get her
 
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
Madam clerk just let me know when you're
 
01:23:22.159 --> 01:23:26.270 align:start position:0%
Madam clerk just let me know when you're
ready

01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%

literally nothing to do with protecting

contrary not accepting our children for

who they are and forcing them to be

something they are not is abusive it can
 
03:39:31.910 --> 03:39:31.920 align:start position:0%

Julian Associates as a
 
03:42:58.830 --> 03:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
male um throughout his life jul Julian
 
03:43:01.630 --> 03:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
fought his femininity from wearing girl
 
03:43:03.750 --> 03:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
clothes and playing with girl toys it
 
03:43:06.870 --> 03:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
was obvious we just didn't see
 
03:43:10.110 --> 03:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
it I'm sure his teachers saw it and yet
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
it went unnoticed he climbed trees
 
03:43:14.469 --> 03:43:14.479 align:start position:0%
searched for bugs played with Ninja
 
03:43:16.349 --> 03:43:16.359 align:start position:0%
Turtles and through all throughout his
 
03:43:19.030 --> 03:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
childhood he never invited girls to his
 
03:43:21.710 --> 03:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
birthday parties his father his father
 
03:43:24.269 --> 03:43:24.279 align:start position:0%
and I passed him off as a tomboy we
 
03:43:27.550 --> 03:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
didn't know anything else I wish we knew
 
03:43:30.870 --> 03:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
then what we know now by middle school
 
03:43:32.910 --> 03:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
and on many occasions I would come home
 
03:43:35.189 --> 03:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
from work and he would be crying in his
 
03:43:38.429 --> 03:43:38.439 align:start position:0%
bedroom I remind you that we raised two
 
03:43:41.070 --> 03:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
two girl children we knew what normal
 
03:43:44.750 --> 03:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
was at this age this was not normal
 
03:43:46.590 --> 03:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes he would allow me to console
 
03:43:48.750 --> 03:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
him but most times he I would just sit
 
03:43:51.229 --> 03:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
on the floor at the end of his bed and
 
03:43:54.229 --> 03:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
wait for him to settle down to offer my
 
03:43:56.990 --> 03:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
shoulder he just could not describe what
 
03:43:59.389 --> 03:43:59.399 align:start position:0%
was bothering him I could only sit and
 
03:44:01.469 --> 03:44:01.479 align:start position:0%
watch him battle with the inner
 
03:44:03.790 --> 03:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
demons to say that middle school was
 
03:44:06.630 --> 03:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
unpleasant for him is an understatement
 
03:44:08.349 --> 03:44:08.359 align:start position:0%
relationships were difficult his
 
03:44:10.950 --> 03:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
attempts at dating were forced he was
 
03:44:13.149 --> 03:44:13.159 align:start position:0%
picked on on a regular basis for being
 
03:44:16.389 --> 03:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
different than everybody else
 
03:44:19.469 --> 03:44:19.479 align:start position:0%
at 15 he was convinced that he was gay
 
03:44:22.110 --> 03:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
great I thought I finally had an answer
 
03:44:23.469 --> 03:44:23.479 align:start position:0%
that he could have been worse things
 
03:44:23.479 --> 03:44:24.910 align:start position:0%
that he could have been worse things
like

03:44:24.910 --> 03:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:44:27.750 --> 03:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
pregnant this Revelation helped somewhat
 
03:44:30.550 --> 03:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
but the pain it never helped the pain
 
03:44:33.189 --> 03:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
entirely he managed to find an accepting
 
03:44:34.870 --> 03:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
group of friends and had wonderful
 
03:44:36.630 --> 03:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
teachers who helped him through and
 
03:44:38.349 --> 03:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
somehow he managed to make it through
 
03:44:40.630 --> 03:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
high school and graduate but looking
 
03:44:43.710 --> 03:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
back now I see that he was never
 
03:44:46.189 --> 03:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
happy as a a freshman in college he
 
03:44:48.670 --> 03:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
decided to seek therapy and last year
 
03:44:50.910 --> 03:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
when he told me that he had concluded
 
03:44:52.790 --> 03:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
and please notice that I used the word
 
03:44:56.110 --> 03:44:56.120 align:start position:0%
concluded not decided that he Associates
 
03:44:59.590 --> 03:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
as male I was not really
 
03:45:02.110 --> 03:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
surprised this year I have supported my
 
03:45:05.990 --> 03:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
child my son in his journey as a parent
 
03:45:09.229 --> 03:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
we only want our child to be
 
03:45:12.950 --> 03:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
happy watching him as he transitions
 
03:45:14.710 --> 03:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
into the person he was always meant to
 
03:45:14.720 --> 03:45:15.870 align:start position:0%
into the person he was always meant to
be

03:45:15.870 --> 03:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:45:17.590 --> 03:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
has not always been
 
03:45:21.630 --> 03:45:21.640 align:start position:0%
easy it's hard to understand but I never
 
03:45:24.110 --> 03:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
I've never seen him happier the
 
03:45:26.670 --> 03:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
transition has given him confidence that
 
03:45:28.870 --> 03:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
he has never had he looks into the
 
03:45:30.630 --> 03:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
mirror and he likes himself for the
 
03:45:33.750 --> 03:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
first time ever forcing children to
 
03:45:36.149 --> 03:45:36.159 align:start position:0%
conform to our Norms is not going to
 
03:45:38.950 --> 03:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
help a transg transgender child
 
03:45:40.950 --> 03:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
suppressing their identity does not make
 
03:45:44.030 --> 03:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
it go away puberty is hard enough on a
 
03:45:46.189 --> 03:45:46.199 align:start position:0%
child without the in a person fighting
 
03:45:48.389 --> 03:45:48.399 align:start position:0%
with the outward person's
 
03:45:51.030 --> 03:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
appearance I know I have W witnessed
 
03:45:54.630 --> 03:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
this personally what we didn't know is
 
03:45:56.670 --> 03:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
that we we could have
 
03:45:58.950 --> 03:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
helped every parent should stop and
 
03:46:01.710 --> 03:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
think about what if it happens to them I
 
03:46:04.349 --> 03:46:04.359 align:start position:0%
did not just decide I wanted to mix it
 
03:46:06.750 --> 03:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
up a little and have a transgender child
 
03:46:08.670 --> 03:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
my child did not just decide that he
 
03:46:10.870 --> 03:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
could use a good challenge and pretend
 
03:46:12.550 --> 03:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
to be male so that he could get beat up
 
03:46:15.309 --> 03:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
in a bathroom
 
03:46:16.950 --> 03:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
all the signs were there from early
 
03:46:19.550 --> 03:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
childhood and we had been in if we had
 
03:46:23.309 --> 03:46:23.319 align:start position:0%
been better informed if we had been
 
03:46:25.870 --> 03:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
educated if we had known that we could
 
03:46:28.269 --> 03:46:28.279 align:start position:0%
simply and safely put off puberty and
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps spare him the pain depression
 
03:46:33.590 --> 03:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
anger and thoughts of taking his life
 
03:46:35.910 --> 03:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
the confusion he was
 
03:46:37.950 --> 03:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
experiencing when while his outward
 
03:46:39.790 --> 03:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
appearance was battling fiercely with
 
03:46:42.950 --> 03:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:46.389 --> 03:46:46.399 align:start position:0%
person um
 
03:46:48.750 --> 03:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
hold on I lost it not to mention the
 
03:46:50.630 --> 03:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
expense of the reconstructive surgery
 
03:46:52.469 --> 03:46:52.479 align:start position:0%
that he finally to finally look like the
 
03:46:54.429 --> 03:46:54.439 align:start position:0%
person on the outside that he hit he's
 
03:46:56.910 --> 03:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
been all along on the inside which is
 
03:46:58.830 --> 03:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
not all covered by medical insurance I
 
03:47:01.510 --> 03:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
might add there is no doubt we would
 
03:47:03.750 --> 03:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
have sent him to th therapy and put him
 
03:47:06.030 --> 03:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
on puberty blockers by Middle School
 
03:47:08.030 --> 03:47:08.040 align:start position:0%

03:47:09.790 --> 03:47:09.800 align:start position:0%

03:48:45.630 --> 03:48:45.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:48:48.630 --> 03:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
um so I am going to skip right ahead to
 
03:48:52.950 --> 03:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
focusing on um the law and uh
 
03:48:54.229 --> 03:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
specifically the development of
 
03:48:56.750 --> 03:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination law in New Hampshire
 
03:48:59.910 --> 03:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
I I know you all are well aware that in
 
03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
2018 HB
 
03:49:06.550 --> 03:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
1319 um changed the landscape of
 
03:49:09.309 --> 03:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
transgender rights in New Hampshire and
 
03:49:12.070 --> 03:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
finally after many years of of effort by
 
03:49:15.830 --> 03:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
Advocates and um activists
 
03:49:18.990 --> 03:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
uh this body and was instrumental in um
 
03:49:21.149 --> 03:49:21.159 align:start position:0%
in passing HB 1319 and ensured
 
03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination protection for all
 
03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
transgender people in all areas of
 
03:49:29.269 --> 03:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
public life in New Hampshire and then um
 
03:49:32.349 --> 03:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
beyond that uh the following year in
 
03:49:36.229 --> 03:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
2019 um a new statute was passed went
 
03:49:38.990 --> 03:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
into effect that uh protected young
 
03:49:43.269 --> 03:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
people in schools and um you know based
 
03:49:45.990 --> 03:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
on uh gender ident based on sexual
 
03:49:48.469 --> 03:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
orientation based on sex religion race
 
03:49:51.070 --> 03:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
all of the all of the prot protected
 
03:49:52.550 --> 03:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
classifications that protect people from
 
03:49:53.910 --> 03:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination and other aspects of
 
03:49:57.910 --> 03:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
public life so after all of that effort
 
03:50:00.070 --> 03:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
um there's there was still more work to
 
03:50:01.990 --> 03:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
do and there's still is more work to do
 
03:50:04.870 --> 03:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
and um and I want to highlight a couple
 
03:50:07.429 --> 03:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
of other important advancements in terms
 
03:50:09.149 --> 03:50:09.159 align:start position:0%
of the lived experience of transgender
 
03:50:12.429 --> 03:50:12.439 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire one important um
 
03:50:15.870 --> 03:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
bill that was passed ensured protection
 
03:50:17.870 --> 03:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
for transgender people when it comes to
 
03:50:17.880 --> 03:50:18.990 align:start position:0%
for transgender people when it comes to
accessing

03:50:18.990 --> 03:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
accessing
 
03:50:22.309 --> 03:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
healthare and in fact um just last year
 
03:50:23.990 --> 03:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
the division of insurance issued a
 
03:50:28.429 --> 03:50:28.439 align:start position:0%
bulletin further and further um further
 
03:50:30.550 --> 03:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh explaining why those protections are
 
03:50:33.030 --> 03:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
necessary and how they operate to ensure
 
03:50:35.510 --> 03:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
that transgender people are entitled to
 
03:50:37.429 --> 03:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
be free from discrimination in accessing
 
03:50:39.550 --> 03:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
Medical Care and so I'm highlighting
 
03:50:41.870 --> 03:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
that because uh it's in direct
 
03:50:44.269 --> 03:50:44.279 align:start position:0%
contradiction to what this bill proposes
 
03:50:45.469 --> 03:50:45.479 align:start position:0%
to do
 
03:50:48.309 --> 03:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh you can't on one hand uh say that
 
03:50:50.149 --> 03:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
transgender people in New Hampshire
 
03:50:51.790 --> 03:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
should be free from discrimination and
 
03:50:53.550 --> 03:50:53.560 align:start position:0%
accessing healthare and then on the
 
03:50:56.349 --> 03:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
other hand say that granting uh the
 
03:50:58.670 --> 03:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
right to access health care is child
 
03:51:01.670 --> 03:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
abuse um and then another important
 
03:51:03.149 --> 03:51:03.159 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that passed a
 
03:51:06.389 --> 03:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
couple years ago uh that became law in
 
03:51:10.229 --> 03:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the bill that uh
 
03:51:13.630 --> 03:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
prohibited conversion therapy um conver
 
03:51:15.189 --> 03:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
so the bill that prohibited conversion
 
03:51:18.389 --> 03:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
therapy made it unlawful to try to force
 
03:51:21.910 --> 03:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
a person to uh conform to their natal
 
03:51:24.830 --> 03:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
sex instead of uh living in their true
 
03:51:28.710 --> 03:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
gender identity that that that law was a
 
03:51:30.790 --> 03:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
groundbreaking and important move
 
03:51:32.870 --> 03:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
forward in New Hampshire and I just want
 
03:51:35.630 --> 03:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
to clarify that that is that is
 
03:51:38.149 --> 03:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
completely at odds with what this bill
 
03:51:42.030 --> 03:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
is trying to do hp68 is trying to force
 
03:51:44.990 --> 03:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
young people to live in their natal sex
 
03:51:46.670 --> 03:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
and not live consistent with their
 
03:51:49.429 --> 03:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
gender identity and uh it sends the
 
03:51:52.189 --> 03:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
opposite message of what uh of what of
 
03:51:53.870 --> 03:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
what all of the legislative progress
 
03:51:57.469 --> 03:51:57.479 align:start position:0%
that we've made over the years is and um
 
03:52:01.389 --> 03:52:01.399 align:start position:0%
I do want to emphasize that uh that that
 
03:52:03.389 --> 03:52:03.399 align:start position:0%
young people in New Hampshire are
 
03:52:07.670 --> 03:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
entitled to the support of um not just
 
03:52:09.349 --> 03:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
the communities that surround them every
 
03:52:12.910 --> 03:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
day but though but but every every um
 
03:52:15.429 --> 03:52:15.439 align:start position:0%
sorry the legislation and every other
 
03:52:17.950 --> 03:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
body that that represents the state just
 
03:52:20.070 --> 03:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
like everyone else they're entitled to
 
03:52:22.710 --> 03:52:22.720 align:start position:0%

03:52:25.349 --> 03:52:25.359 align:start position:0%

that
 
03:53:48.870 --> 03:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
I'm running uh representing myself um so
 
03:53:53.229 --> 03:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
I'm a mom of a 14-year-old boy um his
 
03:53:57.309 --> 03:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
name is Devin and uh he's really good in
 
03:54:01.149 --> 03:54:01.159 align:start position:0%
school he likes to play golf and he's a
 
03:54:03.750 --> 03:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
really great tennis player he uh goes
 
03:54:06.670 --> 03:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
snowboarding on the weekends and he's
 
03:54:08.630 --> 03:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
really close with his cousins and his
 
03:54:11.229 --> 03:54:11.239 align:start position:0%
family um we're hoping he gets in a
 
03:54:13.070 --> 03:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
Dairy Field next
 
03:54:15.950 --> 03:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
year and and um he's just like an
 
03:54:17.790 --> 03:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
all-around great
 
03:54:19.710 --> 03:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
kind very
 
03:54:23.830 --> 03:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
kind non-judgmental kid and he also
 
03:54:25.510 --> 03:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
happens to be
 
03:54:29.269 --> 03:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
transgender um that's just a part of him
 
03:54:33.790 --> 03:54:33.800 align:start position:0%
it does not define who he is
 
03:54:37.590 --> 03:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
um we kind of knew when he was very
 
03:54:41.870 --> 03:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
young that he was a tom boy is what we
 
03:54:44.950 --> 03:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
thought um cuz I was not educated
 
03:54:47.510 --> 03:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
about being transgender and I think that
 
03:54:50.429 --> 03:54:50.439 align:start position:0%
that's a common issue in today's society
 
03:54:52.429 --> 03:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
as people just need to be educated about
 
03:54:55.110 --> 03:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
this that it's not something scary or
 
03:54:58.990 --> 03:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
crazy um it's just it just is um it's a
 
03:55:02.710 --> 03:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
a medical situation where my son was
 
03:55:06.630 --> 03:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
born with female body parts um you know
 
03:55:09.469 --> 03:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
he wore baseball hats he played football
 
03:55:14.469 --> 03:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
he um he was just a tomboy and um he
 
03:55:16.229 --> 03:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
went into counseling because he started
 
03:55:18.550 --> 03:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
having some just you know emotional
 
03:55:21.030 --> 03:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
struggles when he was eight I mean we
 
03:55:23.269 --> 03:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
were in third grade that's young for
 
03:55:27.309 --> 03:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
young for a kid and um he told me he
 
03:55:29.870 --> 03:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
wanted I mean so he had put on his
 
03:55:32.070 --> 03:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
Christmas list to Santa that he wanted
 
03:55:34.630 --> 03:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
to be a boy and he prayed to God to be a
 
03:55:36.349 --> 03:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
boy so that should have been like you
 
03:55:40.189 --> 03:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
know glaring signs at that time um but I
 
03:55:41.630 --> 03:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
still was not
 
03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
sure when we were seeing a therapist
 
03:55:47.830 --> 03:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
um they suggested that I let him explore
 
03:55:49.910 --> 03:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
this um and so I did I let him get his
 
03:55:52.429 --> 03:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
haircut and he started going by male
 
03:55:55.670 --> 03:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
pronouns um the school he was in at the
 
03:55:59.070 --> 03:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
time would not work with us um he had a
 
03:56:01.309 --> 03:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
very feminine name when he was born and
 
03:56:04.389 --> 03:56:04.399 align:start position:0%
they would not use his uh his male name
 
03:56:06.590 --> 03:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
so I went to court and I changed his
 
03:56:09.790 --> 03:56:09.800 align:start position:0%
name which was a relatively easy process
 
03:56:11.269 --> 03:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
um and something that I knew that I
 
03:56:13.149 --> 03:56:13.159 align:start position:0%
could change back if this was just a
 
03:56:13.159 --> 03:56:14.750 align:start position:0%
could change back if this was just a
phase

03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
phase
 
03:56:18.030 --> 03:56:18.040 align:start position:0%
um I do research for work so I did a lot
 
03:56:20.790 --> 03:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
of research on this topic um and of
 
03:56:24.590 --> 03:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
course this was my child this is my life
 
03:56:28.750 --> 03:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
is my son he's my life and um I just
 
03:56:32.229 --> 03:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
want him to be happy and healthy um so
 
03:56:33.990 --> 03:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
we started seeing an
 
03:56:38.510 --> 03:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
endocrinologist and um kept seeing uh a
 
03:56:41.550 --> 03:56:41.560 align:start position:0%
therapist and the next step was really
 
03:56:44.630 --> 03:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
um puberty blockers um and I was you
 
03:56:46.429 --> 03:56:46.439 align:start position:0%
know I needed to do a lot of research on
 
03:56:50.030 --> 03:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
that because that's medical um but
 
03:56:52.189 --> 03:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers are completely
 
03:56:55.710 --> 03:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
reversible so even if he took those till
 
03:56:59.269 --> 03:56:59.279 align:start position:0%
he was 13 and then it was just a phase
 
03:57:02.750 --> 03:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
he could go off of them and go through
 
03:57:03.990 --> 03:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
puberty as a
 
03:57:07.670 --> 03:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
girl um so that gave a good amount of
 
03:57:10.710 --> 03:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
time uh for him and I to really know
 
03:57:13.710 --> 03:57:13.720 align:start position:0%
that this was something real that he
 
03:57:13.720 --> 03:57:15.469 align:start position:0%
that this was something real that he
wanted

03:57:15.469 --> 03:57:15.479 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
03:57:19.269 --> 03:57:19.279 align:start position:0%
um this was not an easy time for him he
 
03:57:22.910 --> 03:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
didn't choose this path he um he got
 
03:57:26.070 --> 03:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
teased we I pulled him out of school
 
03:57:28.309 --> 03:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
like just one day he just never went
 
03:57:30.469 --> 03:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
back because of the way he was treated
 
03:57:34.670 --> 03:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
by teachers and and kids which just so
 
03:57:37.950 --> 03:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
wrong it's just not it's like not okay
 
03:57:40.110 --> 03:57:40.120 align:start position:0%
oh sorry one minute
 
03:57:45.710 --> 03:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
so anyway he has transitioned he is 14
 
03:57:48.870 --> 03:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
he knows he's a boy he's not having any
 
03:57:52.750 --> 03:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
kind of um surgeries or anything like
 
03:57:57.550 --> 03:57:57.560 align:start position:0%
that he's happy he's healthy he is a
 
03:58:00.750 --> 03:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
good member of society he's kind to
 
03:58:02.389 --> 03:58:02.399 align:start position:0%
people he's non
 
03:58:06.110 --> 03:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
judal um and if I if he didn't
 
03:58:07.990 --> 03:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
transition I don't think I'd have a
 
03:58:11.590 --> 03:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
child so you know I think
 
03:58:15.030 --> 03:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
that this bill is
 
03:58:18.389 --> 03:58:18.399 align:start position:0%
this bill shocks me but um you know I
 
03:58:20.189 --> 03:58:20.199 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose this bill because I
 
03:58:22.469 --> 03:58:22.479 align:start position:0%
think I'm a good mother raising an
 
03:58:25.670 --> 03:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
incredible child and the being
 
03:58:30.110 --> 03:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
transgender is is just a thing it's
 
03:58:31.950 --> 03:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
trans you're being you're a
 
03:58:34.670 --> 03:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
transgender so thank you for your
 
03:58:39.750 --> 03:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:46.830 --> 03:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:50.349 --> 03:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um chairman rice chairwoman
 
03:58:52.550 --> 03:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
rice for taking my question and thank
 
03:58:55.269 --> 03:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
you Kelly for coming to speak with us
 
03:58:59.389 --> 03:58:59.399 align:start position:0%
about share your story um I'm just
 
03:59:02.429 --> 03:59:02.439 align:start position:0%
curious are there supports and services
 
03:59:05.710 --> 03:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
are there parent groups in the state
 
03:59:08.750 --> 03:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
like what supports are there for parents
 
03:59:12.189 --> 03:59:12.199 align:start position:0%
right now um because I'm a parent of a
 
03:59:14.429 --> 03:59:14.439 align:start position:0%
child that has a disability and I know
 
03:59:17.149 --> 03:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
that support groups have been critical
 
03:59:19.389 --> 03:59:19.399 align:start position:0%
so I'm just curious if in New Hampshire
 
03:59:22.229 --> 03:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
we have that right so when he
 
03:59:24.870 --> 03:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
transitioned at 8 or 9ine that's
 
03:59:28.590 --> 03:59:28.600 align:start position:0%
actually very early um especially for uh
 
03:59:30.590 --> 03:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
these days you know people have just
 
03:59:32.630 --> 03:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
started learning what being transgender
 
03:59:36.870 --> 03:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
is about and it's become more public um
 
03:59:39.790 --> 03:59:39.800 align:start position:0%
there were very few we were kind of a
 
03:59:43.349 --> 03:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
nationwide connection um of of people
 
03:59:44.750 --> 03:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
that got together
 
03:59:46.750 --> 03:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
um like a few times a year there's a
 
03:59:51.269 --> 03:59:51.279 align:start position:0%
camp or two camps uh now I have found so
 
03:59:53.830 --> 03:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
my son went still which means that he
 
03:59:56.309 --> 03:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
didn't let anyone in his life know that
 
03:59:58.189 --> 03:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
he was transgender because he felt it
 
04:00:00.469 --> 04:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
was dangerous and he didn't want to get
 
04:00:04.149 --> 04:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
bullied um so he he is private um so we
 
04:00:06.550 --> 04:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
did not go to support groups for a while
 
04:00:06.560 --> 04:00:08.269 align:start position:0%
did not go to support groups for a while
PR

04:00:08.269 --> 04:00:08.279 align:start position:0%

04:00:11.309 --> 04:00:11.319 align:start position:0%
preco the a lot of support groups popped
 
04:00:14.510 --> 04:00:14.520 align:start position:0%

testimony and opposition to
 
04:01:10.710 --> 04:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
hp68 my name is Abby Maxwell I'm from
 
04:01:14.149 --> 04:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
conquer and I did not yet sit submit my
 
04:01:15.950 --> 04:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
testimony and
 
04:01:19.269 --> 04:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
writing I am the parent of an 8-year-old
 
04:01:21.870 --> 04:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
girl recently she filled out a
 
04:01:24.790 --> 04:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
Valentine's worksheet for school and in
 
04:01:28.309 --> 04:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
it I learned that she loves that she can
 
04:01:31.349 --> 04:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
go in the woods from her backyard swim
 
04:01:34.189 --> 04:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
and play video games that she loves that
 
04:01:38.630 --> 04:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
she is brave happy and nice and that she
 
04:01:41.630 --> 04:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
loves that she has pets Woods in her
 
04:01:44.830 --> 04:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
backyard and lots of friends
 
04:01:47.389 --> 04:01:47.399 align:start position:0%
I believe that is a good snapshot of my
 
04:01:51.110 --> 04:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
daughter whose Medical Care and parents
 
04:01:53.349 --> 04:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
this bill attempts to
 
04:01:55.389 --> 04:01:55.399 align:start position:0%
criminalize that's because my daughter
 
04:01:57.990 --> 04:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
also happens to be transgender which in
 
04:02:00.189 --> 04:02:00.199 align:start position:0%
her case means she was assigned male at
 
04:02:03.830 --> 04:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
Birth but is female she first began to
 
04:02:05.990 --> 04:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
tell us of her gender when she was three
 
04:02:09.469 --> 04:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
years old my husband and I did not know
 
04:02:11.590 --> 04:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
what to make of
 
04:02:14.590 --> 04:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
it and frankly we suppressed Ed as much
 
04:02:18.910 --> 04:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
as possible yet as the years went on she
 
04:02:21.670 --> 04:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
became increasingly insistent and when
 
04:02:24.229 --> 04:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
she was six she told us that she did not
 
04:02:26.710 --> 04:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
want to exist anymore if she had to
 
04:02:29.910 --> 04:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
continue to be a boy we sought medical
 
04:02:32.830 --> 04:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
advice and eventually we were referred
 
04:02:34.790 --> 04:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
to the Boston Children's
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
Hospital there we learned about what it
 
04:02:38.550 --> 04:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
means to be
 
04:02:41.030 --> 04:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
transgender and the best practices of
 
04:02:43.110 --> 04:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care to help my
 
04:02:46.550 --> 04:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
daughter have a happy healthy life
 
04:02:49.189 --> 04:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
finally after multiple appointments and
 
04:02:51.790 --> 04:02:51.800 align:start position:0%
lots of research we allowed her to
 
04:02:54.670 --> 04:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
change her name and pronoun and to dress
 
04:02:57.149 --> 04:02:57.159 align:start position:0%
and live as the girl she'd spent years
 
04:03:00.870 --> 04:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
telling us she was the change was
 
04:03:03.429 --> 04:03:03.439 align:start position:0%
remarkable it was like a light came on
 
04:03:05.830 --> 04:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
inside of her
 
04:03:09.510 --> 04:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
overnight all who knew her noticed the
 
04:03:09.520 --> 04:03:12.389 align:start position:0%
overnight all who knew her noticed the
shift

04:03:12.389 --> 04:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:15.349 --> 04:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
instantly I know know what harms my
 
04:03:17.630 --> 04:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
daughter it is that she lives in a
 
04:03:20.030 --> 04:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
culture in which she came home from
 
04:03:22.110 --> 04:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
second grade to tell me that she
 
04:03:24.429 --> 04:03:24.439 align:start position:0%
understood that most people in the world
 
04:03:27.910 --> 04:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
hate transgender people like her it is
 
04:03:30.110 --> 04:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
that her parents have to spend so much
 
04:03:32.710 --> 04:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
time and energy fighting for her right
 
04:03:36.830 --> 04:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
to exist it is bills like this which not
 
04:03:40.030 --> 04:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
only threaten her actual life but also
 
04:03:41.630 --> 04:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
the health of our
 
04:03:44.269 --> 04:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
communities already we have moved from
 
04:03:46.510 --> 04:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
the small New Hampshire town where my
 
04:03:49.309 --> 04:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
family has been for Generations because
 
04:03:52.070 --> 04:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the Discrimination bullying and
 
04:03:55.149 --> 04:03:55.159 align:start position:0%
harassment my daughter faced I know that
 
04:03:58.110 --> 04:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
is not what we want for our state we do
 
04:04:00.149 --> 04:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
not want to be a place that pushes
 
04:04:03.070 --> 04:04:03.080 align:start position:0%
difference out yet this bill would tell
 
04:04:05.750 --> 04:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
our trans youth that they will not be
 
04:04:09.269 --> 04:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
safe here that they do not belong here
 
04:04:11.590 --> 04:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
and in fact that we want them gone so
 
04:04:14.309 --> 04:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
badly that we are willing to crimin aliz
 
04:04:17.030 --> 04:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
their life-saving medical care that is
 
04:04:18.670 --> 04:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
not the message our state should ever
 
04:04:21.510 --> 04:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
send its residents that is not how we
 
04:04:24.269 --> 04:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
build safe communities in which all our
 
04:04:25.910 --> 04:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
children can

thrive in the past few years our
 
04:04:30.590 --> 04:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
lawmakers have made great strides in
 
04:04:33.229 --> 04:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
making our state more inclusive I urge
 
04:04:35.630 --> 04:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
you to oppose this bill and continue the
 
04:04:37.189 --> 04:04:37.199 align:start position:0%

minutes all right um thank you madam
 
04:06:27.229 --> 04:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee for

taking my testimony today my name is
 
04:06:32.149 --> 04:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
Sophia beond Lilo I'm 14 I live in
 
04:06:34.950 --> 04:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester um I have written testimony
 
04:06:36.429 --> 04:06:36.439 align:start position:0%
and I will email it to you guys after
 
04:06:38.550 --> 04:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
the hearing um and I'm speaking today on
 
04:06:39.950 --> 04:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
behalf of the New Hampshire High School
 
04:06:42.189 --> 04:06:42.199 align:start position:0%
Democrats in opposition to
 
04:06:44.750 --> 04:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
hp68 I'm a opposed this bill because if
 
04:06:45.910 --> 04:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
it were enacted it would have
 
04:06:47.510 --> 04:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
devastating effects on the mental and
 
04:06:49.110 --> 04:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
physical well-being of thousands of New
 
04:06:50.750 --> 04:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens and deny them access
 
04:06:52.030 --> 04:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
to healthcare that is absolutely
 
04:06:54.550 --> 04:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
necessary for their basic health there
 
04:06:55.910 --> 04:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
are a number of reasons that this bill
 
04:06:57.790 --> 04:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
is not viable but first and foremost is
 
04:06:59.710 --> 04:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
the wording nowhere in this bill or in
 
04:07:01.269 --> 04:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
the original legislation is the word
 
04:07:03.149 --> 04:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
subject defined so it could be one of
 
04:07:05.269 --> 04:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
two things either this is in reference
 
04:07:06.630 --> 04:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
to a parent forcing their child to
 
04:07:08.550 --> 04:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
transition or it is simply just a ban on
 
04:07:10.950 --> 04:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
transitioning for minors I think it's
 
04:07:12.349 --> 04:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
highly unlikely that this bill is
 
04:07:13.750 --> 04:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
strictly intended to prevent parents
 
04:07:15.469 --> 04:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
from forcing their children forcing
 
04:07:17.149 --> 04:07:17.159 align:start position:0%
their children to medically transition
 
04:07:18.309 --> 04:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
because we all acknowledge that that
 
04:07:20.189 --> 04:07:20.199 align:start position:0%
would be ridiculous Force transition is
 
04:07:21.670 --> 04:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
not happening in the state or anywhere
 
04:07:22.590 --> 04:07:22.600 align:start position:0%
in this country and it would be
 
04:07:24.389 --> 04:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult if ever
 
04:07:26.429 --> 04:07:26.439 align:start position:0%
attended I think what's much more likely
 
04:07:28.149 --> 04:07:28.159 align:start position:0%
is that this bill is explicitly or not
 
04:07:29.630 --> 04:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
intended solely to prevent minors from
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
transitioning and accessing the
 
04:07:32.790 --> 04:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
healthare they need so let's assume that
 
04:07:34.109 --> 04:07:34.119 align:start position:0%
subject could apply to situations where
 
04:07:35.910 --> 04:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
a child willingly transitions in that
 
04:07:37.269 --> 04:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
scenario I would like to address several
 
04:07:38.790 --> 04:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
things as I'm sure that so people will
 
04:07:40.149 --> 04:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
testify today to try and convince the
 
04:07:41.149 --> 04:07:41.159 align:start position:0%
committee that transitioning is
 
04:07:43.950 --> 04:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
dangerous when it is not firstly some
 
04:07:45.429 --> 04:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
people claim that people who transition
 
04:07:47.309 --> 04:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
are motivated by mental illness they may
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
sayate that transgender people are more
 
04:07:50.389 --> 04:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
at risk for certain conditions however
 
04:07:51.870 --> 04:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
this insinuates a relationship between
 
04:07:53.229 --> 04:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
being trans and having mental illness
 
04:07:55.269 --> 04:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
that does not exist a more accurate way
 
04:07:56.790 --> 04:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
to represent the statistic would be that
 
04:07:57.950 --> 04:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
people who are trans are more likely to
 
04:07:59.710 --> 04:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
be harassed and traumatized due to their
 
04:08:01.590 --> 04:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
identity in addition there is a
 
04:08:02.790 --> 04:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
condition called gender dysphoria that
 
04:08:04.269 --> 04:08:04.279 align:start position:0%
many transgender people have which is
 
04:08:05.630 --> 04:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
defined by the American Psychiatric
 
04:08:07.469 --> 04:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
association as psychological distress
 
04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
that results from an in congruence
 
04:08:09.950 --> 04:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
between one's sex assigned to birth and
 
04:08:12.269 --> 04:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
one's gender identity this experience
 
04:08:14.189 --> 04:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
can be crippling for many gender people
 
04:08:15.670 --> 04:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
and can contribute to other aspects of
 
04:08:17.149 --> 04:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
their mental health but it is also the
 
04:08:18.670 --> 04:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
reason why transitioning is so important
 
04:08:20.550 --> 04:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
for people with gender dysphoria
 
04:08:22.469 --> 04:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
according to a study from 2018 people
 
04:08:24.109 --> 04:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
who have gender dysphoria are at higher
 
04:08:25.750 --> 04:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
risk for suicidal ideation and other
 
04:08:27.830 --> 04:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
mental health issues as we've heard
 
04:08:29.469 --> 04:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
transitioning is one of the only ways
 
04:08:30.750 --> 04:08:30.760 align:start position:0%
this type of dysphoria can be treated
 
04:08:32.229 --> 04:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
and Leed so not only is being
 
04:08:33.790 --> 04:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
transgender not a result of Mental
 
04:08:35.830 --> 04:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
Illness but in fact transitioning
 
04:08:37.469 --> 04:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
significantly improves mental health for
 
04:08:39.349 --> 04:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
Trans people with gender
 
04:08:41.590 --> 04:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
dysphoria some also say that transgender
 
04:08:43.469 --> 04:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
people may regret transitioning however
 
04:08:45.710 --> 04:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
that data is largely outdated in a study
 
04:08:49.229 --> 04:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
in 2005 that sampled 325 people only two
 
04:08:50.469 --> 04:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
expressed any regrets after
 
04:08:52.229 --> 04:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
transitioning this is a minute
 
04:08:53.750 --> 04:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
percentage and in no way represents any
 
04:08:55.429 --> 04:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
significant amount of people especially
 
04:08:56.950 --> 04:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
when you consider that almost 5,000
 
04:08:58.790 --> 04:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
transgender people are estimated to live
 
04:09:01.109 --> 04:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the researchers also
 
04:09:02.429 --> 04:09:02.439 align:start position:0%
stated that after treatment the group
 
04:09:04.149 --> 04:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
was no longer gender dysphoric and that
 
04:09:05.630 --> 04:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
the vast majority functioned quite well
 
04:09:07.830 --> 04:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
psychologically and socially D
 
04:09:09.550 --> 04:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
transitioning is not a major issue in
 
04:09:10.910 --> 04:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's communities or anywhere
 
04:09:12.550 --> 04:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
else and trying to use that to justify
 
04:09:14.269 --> 04:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
dangerous and hateful bill is not only
 
04:09:16.030 --> 04:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
wrong but also wholly lacking in any
 
04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
real logical basis in conclusion what is
 
04:09:19.910 --> 04:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
important to recognize is that
 
04:09:21.550 --> 04:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
transitioning as a transgender person is
 
04:09:23.070 --> 04:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
not a result of mental illness or a
 
04:09:24.950 --> 04:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
trend or a phase but it is something
 
04:09:26.510 --> 04:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
that is necessary for many transgender
 
04:09:28.070 --> 04:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
people and those who experience gender
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
dysphoria preventing transgender people
 
04:09:31.469 --> 04:09:31.479 align:start position:0%
from accessing the help they need
 
04:09:32.950 --> 04:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
directly harms them and if this bill
 
04:09:34.269 --> 04:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
were to be abused it would have exactly
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
that effect so in conclusion I urge the
 
04:09:37.710 --> 04:09:37.720 align:start position:0%
committee to do what is necessary to
 
04:09:39.349 --> 04:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
project transgender people in the State
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:51.870 --> 04:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:54.109 --> 04:09:54.119 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
04:10:12.070 --> 04:10:12.080 align:start position:0%

04:11:16.830 --> 04:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
while Iris was assigned male gender at
 
04:11:20.349 --> 04:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
Birth it is clear to us now that our
 
04:11:23.309 --> 04:11:23.319 align:start position:0%
daughter has always been a girl
 
04:11:26.550 --> 04:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
beginning at age three every year she
 
04:11:28.910 --> 04:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
said she wanted Santa Claus to turn her
 
04:11:30.030 --> 04:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
into a
 
04:11:33.469 --> 04:11:33.479 align:start position:0%
girl eventually when she was six she
 
04:11:36.469 --> 04:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
wanted her outward identity to match her
 
04:11:36.479 --> 04:11:37.630 align:start position:0%
wanted her outward identity to match her
inner

04:11:37.630 --> 04:11:37.640 align:start position:0%
inner
 
04:11:40.030 --> 04:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
identity and I went into the details in
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
my letter of how she expressed that to
 
04:11:45.950 --> 04:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
us and very child appropriate ways she
 
04:11:48.950 --> 04:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
needed to wear only girls clothes she
 
04:11:51.550 --> 04:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
needed to use the female pronoun she
 
04:11:52.950 --> 04:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
needed a girl's
 
04:11:55.870 --> 04:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
name in a matter of a few months her
 
04:11:58.469 --> 04:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
coming out was complete including our
 
04:12:00.670 --> 04:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
family having established a wonderful
 
04:12:03.189 --> 04:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
relationship with the great team at
 
04:12:05.950 --> 04:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
Boston Children's Hospital our daughter
 
04:12:07.830 --> 04:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
sees an entire team of health
 
04:12:10.309 --> 04:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
professionals there who collaborate with
 
04:12:13.309 --> 04:12:13.319 align:start position:0%
similar experts worldwide including a
 
04:12:16.229 --> 04:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
medical doctor a nurse practitioner and
 
04:12:19.109 --> 04:12:19.119 align:start position:0%
a psychologist our daughter's capable
 
04:12:22.070 --> 04:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
team adhere to the gold standard in
 
04:12:24.910 --> 04:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
medical treatment of gender diverse
 
04:12:28.550 --> 04:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
patients that is to perform a
 
04:12:31.670 --> 04:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
Comprehensive Psychological and medical
 
04:12:34.630 --> 04:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
assessment to create an
 
04:12:36.870 --> 04:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
individualized treatment
 
04:12:40.349 --> 04:12:40.359 align:start position:0%
plan our daughter's providers know that
 
04:12:43.349 --> 04:12:43.359 align:start position:0%
untreated gender dysphoria would put her
 
04:12:46.309 --> 04:12:46.319 align:start position:0%
at much greater risk of suicide and
 
04:12:50.229 --> 04:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
other grave emotional challenges hp68
 
04:12:53.030 --> 04:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
would put us as parents in a position of
 
04:12:55.429 --> 04:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
becoming criminals under New Hampshire
 
04:12:58.349 --> 04:12:58.359 align:start position:0%
law if we follow that individualized
 
04:13:00.309 --> 04:13:00.319 align:start position:0%
treatment plan created by our daughter's
 
04:13:02.870 --> 04:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
medical team it would put our daughter
 
04:13:06.189 --> 04:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
at risk of grave harm other children's
 
04:13:08.469 --> 04:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
families have the personal freedom to
 
04:13:10.469 --> 04:13:10.479 align:start position:0%
decide what medical treatment is
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate for their children our
 
04:13:14.590 --> 04:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
family would have that taken away from
 
04:13:17.790 --> 04:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
us if h68 became
 
04:13:21.149 --> 04:13:21.159 align:start position:0%
law it's been almost 4 years since Iris
 
04:13:23.870 --> 04:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
came out and her identifying as a girl
 
04:13:27.149 --> 04:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
remains consistent and persistent she's
 
04:13:28.910 --> 04:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
gone through the legal processes to
 
04:13:31.349 --> 04:13:31.359 align:start position:0%
change her gender marker to female and
 
04:13:33.229 --> 04:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
to change her name to a traditional name
 
04:13:37.189 --> 04:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
for a girl Iris being a girl is like the
 
04:13:39.469 --> 04:13:39.479 align:start position:0%
color of her skin or the height she will
 
04:13:41.830 --> 04:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
be when she grows up it is an
 
04:13:45.149 --> 04:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
inescapable and inherent
 
04:13:47.950 --> 04:13:47.960 align:start position:0%

appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
04:15:49.309 --> 04:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to HB 68 um there's
 
04:15:51.109 --> 04:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
been some incredible testimony given
 
04:15:53.990 --> 04:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
already and so I'm going to focus uh my
 
04:15:56.510 --> 04:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
oral testimony on our legal concerns
 
04:15:58.510 --> 04:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
with this bill and I've submitted longer
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
written testimony to the committee I
 
04:16:02.590 --> 04:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
want to underscore that passage of this
 
04:16:04.229 --> 04:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
bill would result in New Hampshire
 
04:16:06.550 --> 04:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
falling out of compliance with state and
 
04:16:08.710 --> 04:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
federal law which could open the state
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
to legal action by those families
 
04:16:12.950 --> 04:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
prevented from accessing medically NE
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
necessary care federal courts have held
 
04:16:17.790 --> 04:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
that discrimination against transgender
 
04:16:20.109 --> 04:16:20.119 align:start position:0%
individuals is impermissible sex
 
04:16:23.030 --> 04:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination under the US Constitution
 
04:16:24.670 --> 04:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
and federal laws prohibiting
 
04:16:27.269 --> 04:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
discrimination on the basis of sex this
 
04:16:30.710 --> 04:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
includes title 7 and section 1557 of the
 
04:16:32.990 --> 04:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act moreover
 
04:16:34.950 --> 04:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
discrimination against transgender
 
04:16:37.710 --> 04:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
individuals is also impermissible sex
 
04:16:40.070 --> 04:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination under our comparable
 
04:16:43.269 --> 04:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination state laws where law
 
04:16:45.269 --> 04:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
singles out People based on the fact
 
04:16:46.950 --> 04:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
that they have a gender identity that
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
does not match the sex assigned to them
 
04:16:51.790 --> 04:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
at Birth it necessarily discriminates on
 
04:16:54.830 --> 04:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
the basis of sex and trans status as the
 
04:16:57.950 --> 04:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court stated just last year
 
04:17:00.670 --> 04:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
quote it is impossible to discriminate
 
04:17:03.309 --> 04:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
against a person for being transgender
 
04:17:05.229 --> 04:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
without discriminating against that
 
04:17:09.670 --> 04:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
individual based on sex for example a
 
04:17:11.750 --> 04:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill that permits medical treatment for
 
04:17:13.830 --> 04:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
example hormone ther therapy when
 
04:17:15.429 --> 04:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
medically necessary for a
 
04:17:18.070 --> 04:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
non-transgender minor but that would
 
04:17:20.189 --> 04:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
criminalize parents for supporting the
 
04:17:22.590 --> 04:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
same procedure for a transgender minor
 
04:17:25.149 --> 04:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
for whom it is also medically necessary
 
04:17:27.670 --> 04:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
treatment for gender dysphoria
 
04:17:30.070 --> 04:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
discriminates based on sex gender
 
04:17:33.309 --> 04:17:33.319 align:start position:0%
identity transgender status and sex
 
04:17:36.030 --> 04:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
stereotyping put simply this bill would
 
04:17:38.429 --> 04:17:38.439 align:start position:0%
result in discrimination it would deny
 
04:17:40.189 --> 04:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
families the ability to care for
 
04:17:42.990 --> 04:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
transgender minors and ultimately lead
 
04:17:44.990 --> 04:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
to devastating Health outcomes for
 
04:17:47.550 --> 04:17:47.560 align:start position:0%
vulnerable young people the bill has no
 
04:17:50.590 --> 04:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
sound basis in science or medicine and
 
04:17:52.590 --> 04:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
would open the state of New Hampshire to
 
04:17:55.630 --> 04:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
costly and protracted legal challenges
 
04:17:57.750 --> 04:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I respectfully urge
 
04:17:59.389 --> 04:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee to vote
 
04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%

04:18:45.189 --> 04:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
oppose h b68 relative to the definition
 
04:18:49.109 --> 04:18:49.119 align:start position:0%
of child abuse I've thought the previous
 
04:18:50.670 --> 04:18:50.680 align:start position:0%
testimony has been very powerful
 
04:18:53.189 --> 04:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
especially from the parents of trans
 
04:18:55.149 --> 04:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
children um I have a little bit of a
 
04:18:58.149 --> 04:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
different perspective as I am a mom of
 
04:19:01.630 --> 04:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
an eight-year old cisgender um
 
04:19:05.030 --> 04:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
daughter um if but at any point she
 
04:19:08.149 --> 04:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
shows that she identifies those trans as
 
04:19:11.269 --> 04:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
a trans child it would be a long process
 
04:19:13.469 --> 04:19:13.479 align:start position:0%
with many healthc care providers
 
04:19:15.910 --> 04:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
involved gender affirming treatments are
 
04:19:17.990 --> 04:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
not taken lightly and they're under the
 
04:19:20.990 --> 04:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
care of a trained doctor I have concerns
 
04:19:23.109 --> 04:19:23.119 align:start position:0%
with this bill as any parent should
 
04:19:24.990 --> 04:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
because it inserts the government into
 
04:19:27.710 --> 04:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
the role of parents and doctors and
 
04:19:29.429 --> 04:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
prohibits them from making informed
 
04:19:31.990 --> 04:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
decisions for the children's whose care
 
04:19:34.030 --> 04:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
is entrusted to
 
04:19:36.830 --> 04:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
them we've heard study after study has
 
04:19:39.070 --> 04:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
shown that affirming trans kids and
 
04:19:40.990 --> 04:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
following the affirming model has been
 
04:19:43.590 --> 04:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
recommended by nearly every Major
 
04:19:43.600 --> 04:19:45.870 align:start position:0%
recommended by nearly every Major
Medical

04:19:45.870 --> 04:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
Medical
 
04:19:48.950 --> 04:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
Association on a personal level I have
 
04:19:52.149 --> 04:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
witnessed one of my daughters friends
 
04:19:53.469 --> 04:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
come out as
 
04:19:57.389 --> 04:19:57.399 align:start position:0%
trans and I've seen how much affirming
 
04:20:00.229 --> 04:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
her gender has impacted her behavior in
 
04:20:04.349 --> 04:20:04.359 align:start position:0%
a positive way she is much happier she
 
04:20:08.070 --> 04:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
smiles more and it's so easy to see her
 
04:20:09.469 --> 04:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
confidence has
 
04:20:11.790 --> 04:20:11.800 align:start position:0%
improved it's like she is a different
 
04:20:11.800 --> 04:20:13.189 align:start position:0%
improved it's like she is a different
child

04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
child
 
04:20:16.469 --> 04:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
she has caring and loving parents and
 
04:20:18.109 --> 04:20:18.119 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
04:20:21.189 --> 04:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
abuse for a parent of a trans kid this
 
04:20:24.229 --> 04:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
bill can do harm to a child's future and
 
04:20:25.950 --> 04:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
can contribute to more
 
04:20:29.109 --> 04:20:29.119 align:start position:0%
suicides but all of us parents should be
 
04:20:32.429 --> 04:20:32.439 align:start position:0%
concerned about a bill like this Medical
 
04:20:34.590 --> 04:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
Treatments should be Private Matter
 
04:20:36.870 --> 04:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
between children their parents and
 
04:20:36.880 --> 04:20:38.229 align:start position:0%
between children their parents and
trained

04:20:38.229 --> 04:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
trained
 
04:20:41.830 --> 04:20:41.840 align:start position:0%

04:20:43.269 --> 04:20:43.279 align:start position:0%

hp68 introduced by representative Dave
 
04:21:53.910 --> 04:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
testerman of marac his bill as we all
 
04:21:55.830 --> 04:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
know seeks to add sexual harassment to
 
04:21:57.790 --> 04:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
the sexual reassignment to the
 
04:22:00.189 --> 04:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
definition of an abused child as a
 
04:22:01.830 --> 04:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
legislator in New Hampshire one must
 
04:22:03.670 --> 04:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
take an oath which states in part I will
 
04:22:05.910 --> 04:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
faithfully and impartially discharge and
 
04:22:07.510 --> 04:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
perform all my D all the duties
 
04:22:08.910 --> 04:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
incumbent on me as a state
 
04:22:10.790 --> 04:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative according to the best of
 
04:22:13.510 --> 04:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
my abilities it is also to be understood
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
that prior to proposing any law to
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
abridge citizens rights a modum of
 
04:22:19.309 --> 04:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
research on the relevant subject matter
 
04:22:21.710 --> 04:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
should be a requirement a brief Google
 
04:22:23.790 --> 04:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
search provided me with the following
 
04:22:26.469 --> 04:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
that as far back as 2019 the American
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
Medical Association approximated about
 
04:22:32.710 --> 04:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
150,000 youth ages 13 to 17 in the US
 
04:22:35.510 --> 04:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
identify as transgender that meaning
 
04:22:37.389 --> 04:22:37.399 align:start position:0%
those individuals whose gender identity
 
04:22:38.990 --> 04:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
and or expression is different from
 
04:22:41.149 --> 04:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
cultural expectations based on the sex
 
04:22:43.469 --> 04:22:43.479 align:start position:0%
they were assigned at Birth the AMA
 
04:22:45.630 --> 04:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
notes that every Major Medical
 
04:22:47.670 --> 04:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
Association in the US recognizes the
 
04:22:49.790 --> 04:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
medical necessity of transition related
 
04:22:51.990 --> 04:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
care from improving the physical and
 
04:22:54.030 --> 04:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
mental health of transgender people
 
04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
where medically necessary services that
 
04:22:58.510 --> 04:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
affirm gender or treat gender dysphoria
 
04:23:00.389 --> 04:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
may include but are not limited to
 
04:23:02.550 --> 04:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
mental health counseling non-medical
 
04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
social transition gender affirming
 
04:23:07.389 --> 04:23:07.399 align:start position:0%
hormone therapy and or gender affirming
 
04:23:09.870 --> 04:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
surgeries furthermore the AMA has found
 
04:23:12.550 --> 04:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
that gender-based discriminating
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
affecting access to Services Bill
 
04:23:14.720 --> 04:23:16.070 align:start position:0%
affecting access to Services Bill
suggests

04:23:16.070 --> 04:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
suggests
 
04:23:19.990 --> 04:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
that such as hp68 is a strong predictor
 
04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
of suicide risk among transgender
 
04:23:25.269 --> 04:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
persons here are teens the AMA cited
 
04:23:27.070 --> 04:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
studies which show that suicide rates
 
04:23:30.630 --> 04:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
dropped from 30% pre-treatment to 8%
 
04:23:33.950 --> 04:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
post treatment hp68 runs counter to the
 
04:23:35.790 --> 04:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
state's most precious tenant to live
 
04:23:38.469 --> 04:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
free I for one take these Liberties very
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
seriously hp68 seeks to marginalize a
 
04:23:43.630 --> 04:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
subset of our children and criminalize
 
04:23:45.790 --> 04:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
their medically necessary Health Care to
 
04:23:47.389 --> 04:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
interfere with our children and their
 
04:23:49.149 --> 04:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
doctors to interfere with parents care
 
04:23:50.910 --> 04:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
for their children is clearly an
 
04:23:52.670 --> 04:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
interference on our children's life
 
04:23:55.030 --> 04:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
liberty and privacy just to name a few
 
04:23:57.149 --> 04:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
on its face this bill is born not only
 
04:23:59.349 --> 04:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
out of ignorance but is a blatant
 
04:24:01.229 --> 04:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
attempt to dehumanize a group of
 
04:24:03.149 --> 04:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
individuals deemed different or less
 
04:24:06.189 --> 04:24:06.199 align:start position:0%
than by the Bill's sponsor transmen are
 
04:24:09.389 --> 04:24:09.399 align:start position:0%
men trans women are women they are
 
04:24:11.830 --> 04:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
citizens of our country and of our state
 
04:24:13.990 --> 04:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
and just like me we all deserve
 
04:24:16.349 --> 04:24:16.359 align:start position:0%
protection under the Constitution New
 
04:24:17.790 --> 04:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children should be able to
 
04:24:20.590 --> 04:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
live free and not die due to withholding
 
04:24:22.510 --> 04:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
of medically necessary treatment by the
 
04:24:25.309 --> 04:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislature I also believe
 
04:24:27.070 --> 04:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
strongly that accountability is needed
 
04:24:29.030 --> 04:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
for those who seek to dehumanize any
 
04:24:30.870 --> 04:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
group whether through their use of
 
04:24:33.830 --> 04:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
language or their actions my position is
 
04:24:36.389 --> 04:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
that hp68 is repugnant to the rights and
 
04:24:38.030 --> 04:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
Liberties contained in the New Hampshire
 
04:24:40.389 --> 04:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
state constitution and must be deemed
 
04:24:42.790 --> 04:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate thank you for

support trust and love my child and this
 
04:25:35.590 --> 04:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
bill directly interferes with that
 
04:25:37.750 --> 04:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
relationship by making it a Crim
 
04:25:39.990 --> 04:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
criminal act to help your child receive
 
04:25:44.109 --> 04:25:44.119 align:start position:0%
gender affirmative care um
 
04:25:46.030 --> 04:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
you know you've already heard that the
 
04:25:48.030 --> 04:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
American Academy of P Pediatrics
 
04:25:51.510 --> 04:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
condemns bills like these um about the
 
04:25:55.070 --> 04:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
long-term psychological and physical uh
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
and emotional harm that can be caused by
 
04:25:59.870 --> 04:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
denying these gender affirmative
 
04:26:03.910 --> 04:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
therapies to Children um you know the
 
04:26:07.070 --> 04:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
best way to help these these transgender
 
04:26:09.109 --> 04:26:09.119 align:start position:0%
children is to ensure that it continues
 
04:26:11.229 --> 04:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
to be legal to provide them with medical
 
04:26:13.389 --> 04:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
care and to trust them when they tell us
 
04:26:15.830 --> 04:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
who they really are uh this bill only
 
04:26:17.590 --> 04:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
serves to harm a group that is already
 
04:26:20.389 --> 04:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
at risk and should not be passed thank
 
04:26:24.389 --> 04:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much are there any
 
04:26:36.469 --> 04:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
again up next is
 
04:26:43.229 --> 04:26:43.239 align:start position:0%

04:26:48.070 --> 04:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
where you're from and who you're
 
04:26:49.910 --> 04:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
representing and whether or not you have
 
04:26:52.830 --> 04:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
written testimony and you have five
 
04:26:56.189 --> 04:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you so my name is Rowan
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
quam you actually got the pronunciation
 
04:27:00.630 --> 04:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
right um uh I'm from Manchester New
 
04:27:03.030 --> 04:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh representing myself I have
 
04:27:04.950 --> 04:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
not sent in written testimony but I have
 
04:27:06.510 --> 04:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
written down my remarks and I can send
 
04:27:08.630 --> 04:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
them to you uh later
 
04:27:12.189 --> 04:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
today we have already heard that hp68 is
 
04:27:13.830 --> 04:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
is not based in the latest Medical
 
04:27:15.710 --> 04:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
Science we have already heard that it
 
04:27:17.389 --> 04:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
would deny life-saving care to an
 
04:27:20.429 --> 04:27:20.439 align:start position:0%
incredibly vulner vulnerable population
 
04:27:22.870 --> 04:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
and contradict existing law and we have
 
04:27:24.910 --> 04:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
heard very moving testimony from parents
 
04:27:26.670 --> 04:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
of transgender children as well as a
 
04:27:29.229 --> 04:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
transgender child I worry that the
 
04:27:31.109 --> 04:27:31.119 align:start position:0%
motivation for this bill since it is not
 
04:27:33.189 --> 04:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
based in science or pre-existing law is
 
04:27:34.990 --> 04:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
instead based in the belief that it is
 
04:27:38.109 --> 04:27:38.119 align:start position:0%
bad or wrong to be transgender so what I
 
04:27:40.269 --> 04:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
want to offer you briefly is direct
 
04:27:43.389 --> 04:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
testimony from a transgender person
 
04:27:46.229 --> 04:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
I am a gay transgender man I grew up in
 
04:27:49.070 --> 04:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
rural Iowa in the late 90s and 2000s and
 
04:27:50.630 --> 04:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
I did not even know what it meant to be
 
04:27:53.590 --> 04:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
a transgender until I was in college now
 
04:27:55.189 --> 04:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
that I have transitioned I can say
 
04:27:57.510 --> 04:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
confidently that the choice to do so was
 
04:28:00.109 --> 04:28:00.119 align:start position:0%
the best decision I have ever made it
 
04:28:02.309 --> 04:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
has opened up my life in ways that I
 
04:28:04.149 --> 04:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
never could have imagined when I was a
 
04:28:06.510 --> 04:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
child I don't even know how to express
 
04:28:08.790 --> 04:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
this to folks who haven't lived through
 
04:28:10.790 --> 04:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
something like it when I look in the
 
04:28:13.630 --> 04:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
mirror and see my my face when I talk to
 
04:28:15.870 --> 04:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
people and hear the way that my voice
 
04:28:18.269 --> 04:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
sounds when I look at my body and see
 
04:28:21.149 --> 04:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
how much it has changed because of the
 
04:28:22.510 --> 04:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
health care that I have been able to
 
04:28:25.830 --> 04:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
access I am grateful every single day
 
04:28:28.349 --> 04:28:28.359 align:start position:0%
beyond words the fact that young
 
04:28:30.389 --> 04:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
transgender people are now able to
 
04:28:32.790 --> 04:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
access quality gender affirming Health
 
04:28:35.389 --> 04:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
Care at a younger age than I did is
 
04:28:37.710 --> 04:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
amazing and wonderful and should be
 
04:28:40.990 --> 04:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
celebrated not stifled because it is a
 
04:28:45.710 --> 04:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
good thing to be trans I am so proud to
 
04:28:45.720 --> 04:28:46.550 align:start position:0%
good thing to be trans I am so proud to
be

04:28:46.550 --> 04:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:28:50.590 --> 04:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
trans this bill is unscientific
 
04:28:53.590 --> 04:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
Prejudiced and cruel and I urge you to
 
04:28:55.710 --> 04:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
vote no I'm happy to take any questions
 
04:29:01.109 --> 04:29:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:03.710 --> 04:29:03.720 align:start position:0%

testimony to the committee um I'm here
 
04:30:24.070 --> 04:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
to speak in a opposition to hp68 a bill
 
04:30:25.670 --> 04:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
which effectively criminalizes the
 
04:30:28.590 --> 04:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
existence of transgender children I am a
 
04:30:30.790 --> 04:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
transgender resident in New Hampshire
 
04:30:32.950 --> 04:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
trans people including trans children
 
04:30:34.590 --> 04:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
want to live their lives with the same
 
04:30:36.550 --> 04:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
dignity and respect that is afforded to
 
04:30:39.149 --> 04:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
all other citizens not to be styed by
 
04:30:41.590 --> 04:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
bigotry and used as divisive political
 
04:30:41.600 --> 04:30:43.189 align:start position:0%
bigotry and used as divisive political
prop

04:30:43.189 --> 04:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
prop
 
04:30:45.910 --> 04:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
I came out just before my 30th birthday
 
04:30:47.710 --> 04:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
transitioning that late in my life was
 
04:30:50.189 --> 04:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult and disruptive I
 
04:30:51.710 --> 04:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
know young people who are discovering
 
04:30:53.469 --> 04:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
themselves at a much earlier age and it
 
04:30:55.149 --> 04:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
fills my heart with love and joy that
 
04:30:56.910 --> 04:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
they will not face the same difficulties
 
04:31:00.469 --> 04:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
I faced it is my duty as an LGBT Elder
 
04:31:03.189 --> 04:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
to make sure they don't when trans youth
 
04:31:04.990 --> 04:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
receive medical treatment it's typically
 
04:31:07.189 --> 04:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
to delay the onset of puberty until they
 
04:31:08.790 --> 04:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
decide they want horse hormone
 
04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
replacement therapy or HRT HR RT allows
 
04:31:14.030 --> 04:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
them to experience gender affirming
 
04:31:15.590 --> 04:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
physical development as they grow into
 
04:31:17.229 --> 04:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
adulthood rather than feeling like a
 
04:31:19.469 --> 04:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
stranger in their own body a condition
 
04:31:21.189 --> 04:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
called disphoria which leads many to
 
04:31:22.510 --> 04:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
depression and
 
04:31:26.750 --> 04:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
suicide transmed care saves lives
 
04:31:31.510 --> 04:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers are safe HRT is safe so
 
04:31:35.429 --> 04:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
let me be clear anyone supporting HB 68
 
04:31:37.750 --> 04:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
should be ashamed of themselves this
 
04:31:39.510 --> 04:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
bill does not have the safety of trans
 
04:31:42.189 --> 04:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
children at heart in fact the langage of
 
04:31:43.870 --> 04:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
the bill displays an obsession with
 
04:31:46.630 --> 04:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
regulating children's genitals anyone
 
04:31:48.309 --> 04:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
who thinks this is okay should seek
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
counseling for this unhealthy fixation
 
04:31:52.030 --> 04:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
it does not belong in our state
 
04:31:54.710 --> 04:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
legislature let trans children live
 
04:31:57.710 --> 04:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
their lives in peace now I volunteer at
 
04:32:00.269 --> 04:32:00.279 align:start position:0%

04:32:10.670 --> 04:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
bill is Advanced we and our allies will
 
04:32:12.309 --> 04:32:12.319 align:start position:0%

04:32:14.550 --> 04:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
we will mobilize against them thank you
 
04:32:15.790 --> 04:32:15.800 align:start position:0%

hp68 like some of you on this panel and
 
04:33:08.189 --> 04:33:08.199 align:start position:0%

were six or 16 or 26 even

04:33:23.109 --> 04:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
Life magazine and and heard about

04:33:34.429 --> 04:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
1950s but we were mostly ignorant about
 
04:33:37.230 --> 04:33:37.240 align:start position:0%
what it meant to be transgender I dare
 
04:33:40.029 --> 04:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
say that unless we are transgender
 
04:33:43.869 --> 04:33:43.879 align:start position:0%
ourselves or ra in a transgender child
 
04:33:48.109 --> 04:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
or we are a medical worker treating um a
 
04:33:50.629 --> 04:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
transgender person or researching what
 
04:33:53.269 --> 04:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
it means to be transgender we still
 
04:33:55.789 --> 04:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
don't really know but we can listen to
 
04:33:57.551 --> 04:33:57.561 align:start position:0%
our friends who are living this
 
04:34:00.670 --> 04:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
experience we can read comprehensive
 
04:34:03.070 --> 04:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
evidence-based research and we can
 
04:34:07.070 --> 04:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully separate fact from fake
 
04:34:09.590 --> 04:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
information representative testerman
 
04:34:12.470 --> 04:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
said helping transgender children and be
 
04:34:16.029 --> 04:34:16.039 align:start position:0%
their authentic selves just makes no
 
04:34:18.750 --> 04:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
sense I would ask him to do some
 
04:34:21.869 --> 04:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
in-depth research talk to parents health
 
04:34:24.670 --> 04:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
care workers and the many courageous
 
04:34:27.429 --> 04:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
young people who have given testimony on
 
04:34:30.390 --> 04:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
this bill and all of those who spoke in
 
04:34:32.869 --> 04:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
favor of passing the transgender
 
04:34:35.269 --> 04:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination Bill a couple of
 
04:34:38.629 --> 04:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
years ago I would ask that he listen to
 
04:34:41.709 --> 04:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
the testimony he missed last week and
 
04:34:45.670 --> 04:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
maybe today as well we have come a long
 
04:34:49.551 --> 04:34:49.561 align:start position:0%
way in 70 years we now know that gender
 
04:34:52.670 --> 04:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
identity is a complex combination of
 
04:34:55.470 --> 04:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
brain function Gene variance hormone
 
04:34:58.869 --> 04:34:58.879 align:start position:0%
levels and Myriad other factors and that
 
04:35:02.269 --> 04:35:02.279 align:start position:0%
most transgender children are aware of
 
04:35:05.470 --> 04:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
their gender at a very young age helping
 
04:35:08.150 --> 04:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
these children live as their authentic
 
04:35:11.310 --> 04:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
selves makes them much happier much more
 
04:35:14.709 --> 04:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
St able and even saves their lives
 
04:35:18.310 --> 04:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
treating transgender children is not
 
04:35:21.990 --> 04:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
child abuse one expert has said that
 
04:35:25.029 --> 04:35:25.039 align:start position:0%
denying proper care to transgender
 
04:35:28.709 --> 04:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
children is akin to denying care for
 
04:35:32.470 --> 04:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
asthma or cancer these are decisions to
 
04:35:36.390 --> 04:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
be made for the families of the child
 
04:35:39.510 --> 04:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
the child themselves their doctors and
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
medical team not to be made made by
 
04:35:47.310 --> 04:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
legislators I urge you to vote itl on
 
04:35:49.029 --> 04:35:49.039 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank
 
04:35:53.510 --> 04:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:57.109 --> 04:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
04:36:01.230 --> 04:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
you up next is Julian
 
04:36:04.070 --> 04:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
Davis please State who you are where
 
04:36:06.349 --> 04:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
you're from and who you are representing
 
04:36:07.949 --> 04:36:07.959 align:start position:0%
and whether or not you have written
 
04:36:11.590 --> 04:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
testimony and you have five minutes sure
 
04:36:13.510 --> 04:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
my name is Julian Davis I'm a resident
 
04:36:15.910 --> 04:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
of Guilford New Hampshire um I sent in
 
04:36:18.189 --> 04:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
written testimony just a few hours ago
 
04:36:20.990 --> 04:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
and I'll be representing myself today um
 
04:36:22.949 --> 04:36:22.959 align:start position:0%
so I have many concerns about this bill
 
04:36:24.029 --> 04:36:24.039 align:start position:0%
like everybody else who has come to
 
04:36:25.789 --> 04:36:25.799 align:start position:0%
speak today thankfully most of the
 
04:36:27.670 --> 04:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
people who have come to speak were able
 
04:36:30.429 --> 04:36:30.439 align:start position:0%
to uh clarify some misconceptions about
 
04:36:32.070 --> 04:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
transitioning during childhood as well
 
04:36:33.750 --> 04:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
as some of the legal issues around this
 
04:36:35.830 --> 04:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
bill so I won't waste my time by
 
04:36:38.109 --> 04:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
reiterating those details instead I want
 
04:36:39.910 --> 04:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
to talk about what it's like to live as
 
04:36:41.949 --> 04:36:41.959 align:start position:0%
a trans Youth Without access to medical
 
04:36:44.230 --> 04:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
care that we have gathered to discuss
 
04:36:46.230 --> 04:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
today um so some of you may have
 
04:36:47.551 --> 04:36:47.561 align:start position:0%
connected the dots my mom came on
 
04:36:50.709 --> 04:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
earlier to speak about my experience but
 
04:36:53.429 --> 04:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to sort of hear
 
04:36:55.629 --> 04:36:55.639 align:start position:0%
about uh how it is to live as a trans
 
04:36:57.349 --> 04:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
person directly from trans people as
 
04:37:01.029 --> 04:37:01.039 align:start position:0%
well um so I'm a trans person of course
 
04:37:02.551 --> 04:37:02.561 align:start position:0%
and I came to that conclusion as a young
 
04:37:04.789 --> 04:37:04.799 align:start position:0%
adult but I often think about what life
 
04:37:06.551 --> 04:37:06.561 align:start position:0%
could have been like if I had access to
 
04:37:09.869 --> 04:37:09.879 align:start position:0%
blockers and HRT at a younger age it was
 
04:37:11.510 --> 04:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
incredibly uplifting to hear the testim
 
04:37:13.230 --> 04:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
Tony of trans youth who have had the
 
04:37:14.949 --> 04:37:14.959 align:start position:0%
opportunity to express themselves before
 
04:37:17.029 --> 04:37:17.039 align:start position:0%
adulthood but for me there is a
 
04:37:18.709 --> 04:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
bitterness to these sweet stories of
 
04:37:20.910 --> 04:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
self-discovery I find myself mourning
 
04:37:23.390 --> 04:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
the boy I never got to be in thinking of
 
04:37:25.709 --> 04:37:25.719 align:start position:0%
the 20 years worth of photos and home
 
04:37:27.709 --> 04:37:27.719 align:start position:0%
videos that my family and friends have
 
04:37:29.349 --> 04:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
that I can't cherish because the person
 
04:37:32.029 --> 04:37:32.039 align:start position:0%
in those photos is not me I think about
 
04:37:33.429 --> 04:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
all the times I posed for one of these
 
04:37:34.949 --> 04:37:34.959 align:start position:0%
pictures or tried on an outfit at a
 
04:37:37.150 --> 04:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
clothing store expecting to see myself
 
04:37:39.189 --> 04:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
as the person I felt I was only to
 
04:37:40.910 --> 04:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
become overcome with shock
 
04:37:43.230 --> 04:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
disappointment and Dread upon looking at
 
04:37:45.390 --> 04:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
the photo or gazing in the mirror I
 
04:37:47.109 --> 04:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
remembered all the times I listened for
 
04:37:48.269 --> 04:37:48.279 align:start position:0%
the call of my dead name during
 
04:37:50.269 --> 04:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
attendance and class in cringed at the
 
04:37:51.949 --> 04:37:51.959 align:start position:0%
fact that I knew I would have to say
 
04:37:54.910 --> 04:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
here in response and yes like many
 
04:37:56.949 --> 04:37:56.959 align:start position:0%
people who identify as trans I am
 
04:37:58.949 --> 04:37:58.959 align:start position:0%
forever marked by the painful memories
 
04:38:01.109 --> 04:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
and thoughts uh of thoughts and attempts
 
04:38:01.119 --> 04:38:01.910 align:start position:0%
and thoughts uh of thoughts and attempts
at

04:38:01.910 --> 04:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:38:04.029 --> 04:38:04.039 align:start position:0%
suicide the truth of the matter is when
 
04:38:05.830 --> 04:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
I was growing up I existed in a visce
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
grip of standards and expectations that
 
04:38:09.709 --> 04:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
I could never meet from the day that I
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
was born until the day I realized why I
 
04:38:14.070 --> 04:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
felt so out of place so removed from the
 
04:38:16.629 --> 04:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
present at all times I was imprisoned
 
04:38:19.470 --> 04:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
both by my physical body and the set of
 
04:38:21.310 --> 04:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
roles and characteristics arbitrarily
 
04:38:23.390 --> 04:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
assigned to me by a doctor who took one
 
04:38:25.070 --> 04:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
look at my infantile body and said it's
 
04:38:27.869 --> 04:38:27.879 align:start position:0%
a girl I'm grateful to come as far as I
 
04:38:30.109 --> 04:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
have under those severe circumstances
 
04:38:31.750 --> 04:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
and I can finally say that the person I
 
04:38:33.750 --> 04:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
am out here matches the me I am in my
 
04:38:36.189 --> 04:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
head but I can't get those 20 years of
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
memories back and it pains me to think
 
04:38:40.269 --> 04:38:40.279 align:start position:0%
that our St State Legislature might take
 
04:38:42.150 --> 04:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
from the trans youth of today two whole
 
04:38:44.789 --> 04:38:44.799 align:start position:0%
Decades of their lives as well of course
 
04:38:46.349 --> 04:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
representative testman having never
 
04:38:48.670 --> 04:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
experienced dor himself ored a
 
04:38:50.750 --> 04:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
transgender child has no understanding
 
04:38:52.949 --> 04:38:52.959 align:start position:0%
of what this is like I don't fault him
 
04:38:55.390 --> 04:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
for that I do however fault him for
 
04:38:57.310 --> 04:38:57.320 align:start position:0%
being purposefully obstinate in the face
 
04:38:58.949 --> 04:38:58.959 align:start position:0%
of countless statistical figures and
 
04:39:01.029 --> 04:39:01.039 align:start position:0%
data points surrounding this topic and
 
04:39:02.429 --> 04:39:02.439 align:start position:0%
for being unwilling to listen to the
 
04:39:03.949 --> 04:39:03.959 align:start position:0%
accounts of those of us who do have a
 
04:39:06.470 --> 04:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
personal stake in this game this man
 
04:39:08.189 --> 04:39:08.199 align:start position:0%
quite literally left the first hearing
 
04:39:09.789 --> 04:39:09.799 align:start position:0%
just prior to the response Forum which
 
04:39:12.029 --> 04:39:12.039 align:start position:0%
raises a question my mind and I'm sure
 
04:39:14.109 --> 04:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
in the minds of many of those of us who
 
04:39:16.670 --> 04:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
testified as well why did representative
 
04:39:18.949 --> 04:39:18.959 align:start position:0%
testerman leave during the hearing
 
04:39:20.310 --> 04:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps he knew his ideas would not hold
 
04:39:22.150 --> 04:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
steadfast in the face of opposition or
 
04:39:23.830 --> 04:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps he did not want to hear a slew
 
04:39:25.551 --> 04:39:25.561 align:start position:0%
of personal anecdotes about the lives of
 
04:39:27.429 --> 04:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
various trans team and parents of trans
 
04:39:29.470 --> 04:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
children whom I would like to add he is
 
04:39:31.310 --> 04:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to represent as an official of
 
04:39:32.990 --> 04:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire House of
 
04:39:35.269 --> 04:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
Representatives either way the message
 
04:39:36.750 --> 04:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
that I and my fellow citizens of the
 
04:39:38.070 --> 04:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire seek to convey
 
04:39:40.510 --> 04:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
app lies representative testerman not
 
04:39:41.788 --> 04:39:41.798 align:start position:0%
only are your assertions on the matter
 
04:39:43.670 --> 04:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
faulty their implications are dangerous
 
04:39:45.110 --> 04:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
I urge you all to vote against House
 
04:39:47.110 --> 04:39:47.120 align:start position:0%

04:40:30.110 --> 04:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
today I'm here as a parent a New
 
04:40:32.590 --> 04:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident and a former state
 
04:40:34.708 --> 04:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
representative and I'm voicing my
 
04:40:38.390 --> 04:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
unequivocal opposition of
 
04:40:40.708 --> 04:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
hp68 I'm really not sure how many
 
04:40:42.708 --> 04:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
members of the committee have close
 
04:40:44.470 --> 04:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
personal relationships with any
 
04:40:48.628 --> 04:40:48.638 align:start position:0%
transgender youth but I do I I have
 
04:40:51.510 --> 04:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
personal relationships with many I don't
 
04:40:53.150 --> 04:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
know how many committee members know
 
04:40:54.948 --> 04:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
what it means to identify as a
 
04:40:58.350 --> 04:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
transgender as it is one of if not the
 
04:41:00.868 --> 04:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
most misunderstood and discriminated
 
04:41:04.230 --> 04:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
population in the world today imagine
 
04:41:07.350 --> 04:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
waking up every day and realizing you're
 
04:41:10.110 --> 04:41:10.120 align:start position:0%
living in a body that has nothing to do
 
04:41:13.070 --> 04:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
with how you think you and who you are
 
04:41:14.948 --> 04:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
there are children in New Hampshire
 
04:41:17.110 --> 04:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
across our nation and throughout the
 
04:41:20.830 --> 04:41:20.840 align:start position:0%
world who do every day being
 
04:41:24.070 --> 04:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
transgender is never an intentional
 
04:41:26.948 --> 04:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
Choice children look to their parents
 
04:41:29.230 --> 04:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
relatives and other adults in their life
 
04:41:32.390 --> 04:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
for gender affirming support it is not
 
04:41:34.550 --> 04:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
child abuse for a parents to seek out
 
04:41:37.070 --> 04:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
and explore the gender affirming medical

standard care available for transgender
 
04:41:42.990 --> 04:41:43.000 align:start position:0%

medical and mental health evaluations
 
04:41:48.350 --> 04:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
prior to the onset of
 
04:41:51.430 --> 04:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
care denying your child the opportunity
 
04:41:53.430 --> 04:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
to hit the pause button prior to the

background on what it means to be

04:42:38.230 --> 04:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
essentially constitute parents as child

support
 
04:42:45.750 --> 04:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
necessary for gender affirmation care I
 
04:42:47.270 --> 04:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
just ask that the committee let that
 
04:42:50.190 --> 04:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
sink in for a moment loving parents
 
04:42:52.708 --> 04:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
supporting their child's well-being
 
04:42:56.750 --> 04:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
accused of child abuse we are all human
 
04:43:00.110 --> 04:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
beings this type of legislation is
 
04:43:02.550 --> 04:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
discrimination and I'd like to add that
 
04:43:04.390 --> 04:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative testerman brought this
 
04:43:06.470 --> 04:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
bill before the committee last
 
04:43:09.708 --> 04:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
session in to this situation today and
 
04:43:12.350 --> 04:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
the one before he was was the sole
 
04:43:14.190 --> 04:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the
 
04:43:17.708 --> 04:43:17.718 align:start position:0%
bill and in his introduction on February
 
04:43:20.990 --> 04:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
3rd he self- admitted he has no
 
04:43:23.070 --> 04:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
interactions with any transgender
 
04:43:24.350 --> 04:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
children or
 
04:43:28.910 --> 04:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
adults his only expertise in leading to
 
04:43:31.310 --> 04:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is that he's a parent and a
 
04:43:35.788 --> 04:43:35.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:38.510 --> 04:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
background and with that I'd like to
 
04:43:41.190 --> 04:43:41.200 align:start position:0%

trans attendees today who spoke up I
 
04:45:10.470 --> 04:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
loved what Nancy Brennan said I just I'm
 
04:45:12.708 --> 04:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to my letter verbatim but
 
04:45:16.628 --> 04:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
I'm just baffled at how people like
 
04:45:18.628 --> 04:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
representative Dave testerman
 
04:45:22.110 --> 04:45:22.120 align:start position:0%
can um I I just don't understand how
 
04:45:23.708 --> 04:45:23.718 align:start position:0%
they could live with themselves knowing
 
04:45:27.110 --> 04:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
that if if this bill were to be approved
 
04:45:28.510 --> 04:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
you'd be putting the lives of
 
04:45:32.750 --> 04:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
transgenders on the line I it baffles me
 
04:45:35.550 --> 04:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
um makes my blood boil to think that
 
04:45:37.390 --> 04:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
people would mess with my relative like
 
04:45:39.510 --> 04:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
this and all the other lives of
 
04:45:42.350 --> 04:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
transgenders out there I
 
04:45:46.310 --> 04:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
just get it it doesn't make sense
 
04:45:49.868 --> 04:45:49.878 align:start position:0%
um you guys have heard everything but my
 
04:45:51.350 --> 04:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
the parents of my
 
04:45:53.948 --> 04:45:53.958 align:start position:0%

04:46:06.270 --> 04:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
is they they're get they're doing all
 
04:46:07.510 --> 04:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
the right things they're getting the
 
04:46:09.868 --> 04:46:09.878 align:start position:0%
medical advice that that this relative
 
04:46:12.510 --> 04:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
of mine needs
 
04:46:15.550 --> 04:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
um we are in the Live Free or Die I love
 
04:46:17.750 --> 04:46:17.760 align:start position:0%

04:46:24.310 --> 04:46:24.320 align:start position:0%

04:46:27.310 --> 04:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
that my relatives rights thus far have
 
04:46:29.350 --> 04:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
been recognized and protected but again
 
04:46:31.510 --> 04:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
this house bill it would put an end to
 
04:46:34.110 --> 04:46:34.120 align:start position:0%
the progress that has been made thus
 
04:46:37.948 --> 04:46:37.958 align:start position:0%
far and I just can't imagine the
 
04:46:41.190 --> 04:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
negative impact and the grave Danger
 
04:46:43.150 --> 04:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
that would result from
 
04:46:48.230 --> 04:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
this house bill being passed um please
 
04:46:51.750 --> 04:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
do not stop their progress this the
 
04:46:53.788 --> 04:46:53.798 align:start position:0%

04:46:55.590 --> 04:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
professionals that are overseeing the
 
04:46:58.350 --> 04:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
lives of these transgender
 
04:47:02.670 --> 04:47:02.680 align:start position:0%

minutes thank you my name is Aaron
 
04:47:37.190 --> 04:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
Brewer and I did submit written
 
04:47:39.670 --> 04:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm from Logan Utah and I
 
04:47:42.030 --> 04:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
represent myself and I know we've heard
 
04:47:44.230 --> 04:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
a few stories from um people who are
 
04:47:45.990 --> 04:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
very against this bill but I am here in
 
04:47:48.270 --> 04:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
support of it and it's because I was a
 
04:47:51.270 --> 04:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
trans kid I was so insistent and
 
04:47:53.590 --> 04:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
persistent and consistent in my demands
 
04:47:56.030 --> 04:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
that I was a boy that my teacher sent me
 
04:47:58.190 --> 04:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
to the school psychologist to be
 
04:48:00.270 --> 04:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
evaluated the school psychologist
 
04:48:02.390 --> 04:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
admitted that yes indeed I wanted to be
 
04:48:04.590 --> 04:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
a boy but thankfully she did not affirm
 
04:48:07.310 --> 04:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
me instead she came up with a plan to
 
04:48:09.830 --> 04:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
help me manage my feelings of distress
 
04:48:12.510 --> 04:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
and resolve those dysphoric feelings it
 
04:48:15.230 --> 04:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
took a while but eventually I did learn
 
04:48:17.910 --> 04:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
to feel comfortable with myself and I'm
 
04:48:17.920 --> 04:48:19.070 align:start position:0%
to feel comfortable with myself and I'm
so

04:48:19.070 --> 04:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:22.110 --> 04:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
grateful that she did not affirm me
 
04:48:24.030 --> 04:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
because if she had I never would have
 
04:48:26.948 --> 04:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to explore the fact
 
04:48:28.670 --> 04:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
that those gender dysphoric feelings
 
04:48:30.910 --> 04:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
that trans identity was the direct
 
04:48:33.948 --> 04:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
result of a sexual assault that occurred
 
04:48:36.670 --> 04:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
when I was assaulted I decided I was not
 
04:48:39.830 --> 04:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
going to be a girl anymore I hated the
 
04:48:41.590 --> 04:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
body that I believe believed had been
 
04:48:43.708 --> 04:48:43.718 align:start position:0%
assaulted and wanted to distance myself
 
04:48:46.830 --> 04:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
from it I absolutely did not want to be
 
04:48:49.750 --> 04:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
a girl anymore and I'm not the only one
 
04:48:52.470 --> 04:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
I've talked to many many D transitioners
 
04:48:55.030 --> 04:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
who've had the same story they felt that
 
04:48:57.230 --> 04:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
their body had betrayed them and they
 
04:48:59.670 --> 04:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to run away from it if we
 
04:49:02.590 --> 04:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
encourage children to transition we
 
04:49:06.350 --> 04:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
basically discourage them from we if we
 
04:49:07.990 --> 04:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
we discourage them from getting the help
 
04:49:10.110 --> 04:49:10.120 align:start position:0%
that they need to understand those
 
04:49:12.750 --> 04:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
feelings of of self-hatred and shame
 
04:49:16.070 --> 04:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
that are so common with such sexual
 
04:49:19.230 --> 04:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
assaults she did not affirm the
 
04:49:21.948 --> 04:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
self-hatred that I had she did not put
 
04:49:23.470 --> 04:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
me on puberty blockers that would have
 
04:49:26.510 --> 04:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
induced a developmental delay instead
 
04:49:28.350 --> 04:49:28.360 align:start position:0%
she put me in a communication group and
 
04:49:30.310 --> 04:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
she got me support which is what I
 
04:49:30.320 --> 04:49:32.430 align:start position:0%
she got me support which is what I
really

04:49:32.430 --> 04:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:49:35.350 --> 04:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
needed it breaks my heart to imagine
 
04:49:36.910 --> 04:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
what my life would have been like if my
 
04:49:39.190 --> 04:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
school psychologist told me that I was
 
04:49:41.548 --> 04:49:41.558 align:start position:0%
inherently flawed and that the only way
 
04:49:43.750 --> 04:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
to fix myself was to damage my healthy
 
04:49:45.670 --> 04:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
body with puberty blockers cross- sex
 
04:49:47.070 --> 04:49:47.080 align:start position:0%
hormones and
 
04:49:49.310 --> 04:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
surgery doing so would have prevented me
 
04:49:51.310 --> 04:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
from getting the help that I needed to
 
04:49:53.910 --> 04:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
understand the trauma that I endured it
 
04:49:55.670 --> 04:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
would have convinced me that my
 
04:49:57.948 --> 04:49:57.958 align:start position:0%
dissociating from my body was
 
04:50:00.110 --> 04:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate and the only way to manage
 
04:50:02.708 --> 04:50:02.718 align:start position:0%
the feelings I had of
 
04:50:04.788 --> 04:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
distress and it would have prevented me
 
04:50:06.548 --> 04:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
from having the three beautiful children
 
04:50:08.390 --> 04:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
that I have today that have brought me
 
04:50:09.430 --> 04:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
so much
 
04:50:12.110 --> 04:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
joy and is heartbreaking to me that
 
04:50:13.628 --> 04:50:13.638 align:start position:0%
vulnerable children with history of
 
04:50:15.910 --> 04:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
trauma like mine children who are
 
04:50:19.990 --> 04:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
autistic children who have internalized
 
04:50:22.310 --> 04:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
homophobia children who are acting in
 
04:50:24.070 --> 04:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
ways that are not supported by today's
 
04:50:26.110 --> 04:50:26.120 align:start position:0%
social standards of
 
04:50:28.270 --> 04:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
stereotypes are being subjected to
 
04:50:30.150 --> 04:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
experimental interventions that damage
 
04:50:32.708 --> 04:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
their healthy bodies especially when we
 
04:50:34.310 --> 04:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
know that the vast majority of them will
 
04:50:36.590 --> 04:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
resolve their feelings of dysphoria if
 
04:50:38.350 --> 04:50:38.360 align:start position:0%
they are allowed to progress naturally
 
04:50:38.360 --> 04:50:39.270 align:start position:0%
they are allowed to progress naturally
through

04:50:39.270 --> 04:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:50:41.948 --> 04:50:41.958 align:start position:0%
puberty these children who deserve our
 
04:50:44.510 --> 04:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
love and our compassion they need skills
 
04:50:46.310 --> 04:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
to manage their difficult feelings but
 
04:50:49.150 --> 04:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
they also deserve our protection they
 
04:50:51.708 --> 04:50:51.718 align:start position:0%
need to hear the message loud and clear
 
04:50:55.270 --> 04:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
no child is born in the wrong body thank
 
04:50:57.830 --> 04:50:57.840 align:start position:0%

05:05:10.788 --> 05:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
minutes hi my name is an Blanchette I'm
 
05:05:13.230 --> 05:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
from low Massachusetts I'm representing
 
05:05:15.590 --> 05:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
myself um I did send an email I don't
 
05:05:17.270 --> 05:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
know if that's the same as testimony
 
05:05:20.030 --> 05:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
I've never done this before um so I'm
 
05:05:23.548 --> 05:05:23.558 align:start position:0%
really nervous and Confused um I am
 
05:05:26.868 --> 05:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill um though I live in
 
05:05:29.110 --> 05:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I have a grandson that
 
05:05:33.430 --> 05:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
lives in New Hampshire who has been um
 
05:05:36.110 --> 05:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
pushed on the path of the gender
 
05:05:38.110 --> 05:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
ideology and that's what I call it
 
05:05:39.750 --> 05:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
because that's what I believe it is I
 
05:05:43.270 --> 05:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
believe it is not an ideology he was not
 
05:05:46.230 --> 05:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
even 7 years old when my daughter and
 
05:05:49.230 --> 05:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
her transgender spouse decided that he
 
05:05:51.190 --> 05:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
too was also
 
05:05:54.830 --> 05:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
transgender um I've known him his whole
 
05:05:57.430 --> 05:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
life I've been uh participating a
 
05:05:59.390 --> 05:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
grandmother his whole life all the way
 
05:06:01.708 --> 05:06:01.718 align:start position:0%
up to that time I have never seen a sign
 
05:06:04.390 --> 05:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
of gender dysphoria in him since the day
 
05:06:08.948 --> 05:06:08.958 align:start position:0%
he was born I even cut his CT um so when
 
05:06:10.830 --> 05:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
my daughter came out and said that he
 
05:06:14.270 --> 05:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
was transgender I said you know I didn't
 
05:06:15.868 --> 05:06:15.878 align:start position:0%
know much about it even though I knew
 
05:06:17.590 --> 05:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
the spouse was transgender but it was
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
the decision that she made when she was
 
05:06:22.590 --> 05:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
an adult um I went along with it I
 
05:06:24.548 --> 05:06:24.558 align:start position:0%
supported it I supported it when my
 
05:06:26.788 --> 05:06:26.798 align:start position:0%
daughter and this woman got married and
 
05:06:29.230 --> 05:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
after the transition it was when they
 
05:06:31.708 --> 05:06:31.718 align:start position:0%
decided to transition a seven-year-old
 
05:06:35.548 --> 05:06:35.558 align:start position:0%
boy I did some research and uh my
 
05:06:36.948 --> 05:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
daughter was very excited at the
 
05:06:38.350 --> 05:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
prospect of him going on puberty
 
05:06:40.390 --> 05:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
blockers when he was nine and I'm like
 
05:06:41.910 --> 05:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
he's not even seven yet and you're
 
05:06:43.590 --> 05:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
talking about puberty blockers what a
 
05:06:45.788 --> 05:06:45.798 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers I started to do
 
05:06:47.990 --> 05:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
research on him and the harms they are
 
05:06:49.390 --> 05:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
they are not
 
05:06:52.628 --> 05:06:52.638 align:start position:0%
reversible like activists and people
 
05:06:54.910 --> 05:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
want to tell you I have researching this
 
05:06:59.750 --> 05:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
for four years um because I would not go
 
05:07:02.628 --> 05:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
along with the ideology I have been cut
 
05:07:04.470 --> 05:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
out of his life I have not seen him in
 
05:07:08.430 --> 05:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
four years um this whole thing destroys
 
05:07:12.030 --> 05:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
families um tears in the pot but be
 
05:07:14.590 --> 05:07:14.600 align:start position:0%
besides that just the medical aspect of
 
05:07:18.190 --> 05:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
what these drugs do the thing is is the
 
05:07:21.868 --> 05:07:21.878 align:start position:0%
W path and AAP all say these little
 
05:07:24.390 --> 05:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
children that have gender dysphoria and
 
05:07:26.310 --> 05:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
need to persistance stuff they're
 
05:07:29.150 --> 05:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
insistent consistent persistent all the
 
05:07:30.788 --> 05:07:30.798 align:start position:0%
way from the time they're three all the
 
05:07:33.990 --> 05:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
way up my grandson was not that then you
 
05:07:36.030 --> 05:07:36.040 align:start position:0%
got all these teenagers that are on
 
05:07:39.830 --> 05:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
social media Tumblr um all of sudden
 
05:07:42.910 --> 05:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
waking up at 61516 saying they're
 
05:07:46.390 --> 05:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
transgender and there are over 60s
 
05:07:48.350 --> 05:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
something gender clinics in the United
 
05:07:51.670 --> 05:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
States and many of them between them and
 
05:07:54.750 --> 05:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
clean planin Hood teenagers can walk in
 
05:07:57.788 --> 05:07:57.798 align:start position:0%
on the first visit and get hormones on
 
05:08:00.310 --> 05:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
the first visit so a lot of these
 
05:08:02.470 --> 05:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
clinics are not even following their own
 
05:08:04.670 --> 05:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
protocol that they should be living the
 
05:08:06.750 --> 05:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
life they should for like two years
 
05:08:09.110 --> 05:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
before any kind of medication there's a
 
05:08:12.150 --> 05:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
doctor California Joanna ol Kennedy who
 
05:08:16.150 --> 05:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
got 55 million in an nhi study and
 
05:08:18.430 --> 05:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
started testing testosterone on
 
05:08:21.030 --> 05:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
eight-year-old girls because they're
 
05:08:22.670 --> 05:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
finding out that the puberty blockers
 
05:08:23.868 --> 05:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
are not
 
05:08:26.430 --> 05:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
working you know so the they're finding
 
05:08:28.110 --> 05:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
out the puberty blockers are not helping
 
05:08:30.350 --> 05:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
these children because they're stunting
 
05:08:32.070 --> 05:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
the children when they're ATT and
 
05:08:34.510 --> 05:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
they're not keeping up with their PE so
 
05:08:36.590 --> 05:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
they're pushing the testosterone younger
 
05:08:38.990 --> 05:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
they're removing healthy breasts at 13
 
05:08:41.830 --> 05:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
years old old of girls who are confused
 
05:08:43.670 --> 05:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
that don't want to fit into a gender
 
05:08:45.990 --> 05:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
stereotypical box of what it's supposed
 
05:08:48.150 --> 05:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
to be to be a female or what it's
 
05:08:50.948 --> 05:08:50.958 align:start position:0%
supposed to be to be a male you know
 
05:08:54.110 --> 05:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
what is gender anyways and why are we
 
05:08:56.030 --> 05:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
medicalizing these
 
05:09:00.510 --> 05:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
children when 80 to 90% of them desist
 
05:09:12.230 --> 05:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:33.708 --> 05:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:37.948 --> 05:09:37.958 align:start position:0%

05:09:52.150 --> 05:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't long okay how far did you
 
05:09:56.430 --> 05:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:00.350 --> 05:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
heard hello I I don't know you you were
 
05:10:03.150 --> 05:10:03.160 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:10:07.868 --> 05:10:07.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:12.628 --> 05:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:15.910 --> 05:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
90 healthy breasts were
 
05:10:18.430 --> 05:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
removed 13year olds they removing
 
05:10:21.948 --> 05:10:21.958 align:start position:0%
healthy breasts um there is you know
 
05:10:24.190 --> 05:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
most of the testimony I did hear you
 
05:10:25.868 --> 05:10:25.878 align:start position:0%
know that they're saying that you know
 
05:10:27.230 --> 05:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
oh they wish they had that when they
 
05:10:29.868 --> 05:10:29.878 align:start position:0%
were a child it's like they don't know
 
05:10:31.590 --> 05:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
what they would have had happened if
 
05:10:33.390 --> 05:10:33.400 align:start position:0%
they were a child and they're lucky that
 
05:10:35.190 --> 05:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
they got to make these decisions for
 
05:10:37.628 --> 05:10:37.638 align:start position:0%
themselves as an adult the thing is this
 
05:10:40.070 --> 05:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
children cannot consent just had a case
 
05:10:41.548 --> 05:10:41.558 align:start position:0%
in the UK I don't know if you heard
 
05:10:44.910 --> 05:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
about the caribel case um they they it
 
05:10:46.590 --> 05:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
was huge all the way up to the Supreme
 
05:10:48.830 --> 05:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
Court or whatever it is called out there
 
05:10:51.150 --> 05:10:51.160 align:start position:0%
and they determined that children under
 
05:10:54.310 --> 05:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
16 cannot give conformed
 
05:10:56.868 --> 05:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
consent now here in the United States
 
05:10:59.030 --> 05:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
children cannot smoke they can't drink
 
05:11:01.150 --> 05:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
they can't get tattoos there are a lot
 
05:11:03.708 --> 05:11:03.718 align:start position:0%
of things that children cannot do
 
05:11:05.350 --> 05:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
because they cannot give informed
 
05:11:08.430 --> 05:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
consent so we are medically sterilizing
 
05:11:09.750 --> 05:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
these children
 
05:11:12.670 --> 05:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
and teenagers when they don't even know
 
05:11:14.948 --> 05:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
what they're doing I mean every adult in
 
05:11:17.150 --> 05:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
this in this in room knows what it's
 
05:11:19.390 --> 05:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
like to be a teenager every woman in
 
05:11:21.110 --> 05:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
this room knows what it's like to go
 
05:11:23.150 --> 05:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
through puberty and how uncomfortable it
 
05:11:25.548 --> 05:11:25.558 align:start position:0%
is those are just things that are part
 
05:11:30.230 --> 05:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
of natural life um I my personal views I
 
05:11:31.788 --> 05:11:31.798 align:start position:0%
don't believe there's anything such
 
05:11:33.948 --> 05:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
thing as a trans child but I do believe
 
05:11:35.750 --> 05:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
that children can have gender dysphoria
 
05:11:38.628 --> 05:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
and they can be confused about you know
 
05:11:40.548 --> 05:11:40.558 align:start position:0%
the stere stereotypical things that they
 
05:11:41.910 --> 05:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know if you're a little boy and you
 
05:11:44.350 --> 05:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
want to play with a bobby that does not
 
05:11:46.670 --> 05:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
make you a girl you're a boy that likes
 
05:11:48.990 --> 05:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
a Bobby and there's nothing wrong with
 
05:11:52.590 --> 05:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
that Society needs to change what
 
05:11:55.590 --> 05:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
expectations we are supposed to
 
05:11:59.788 --> 05:11:59.798 align:start position:0%
have amongst ourselves instead
 
05:12:04.190 --> 05:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
of thank you um instead of you
 
05:12:07.270 --> 05:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
know instead of put you you're taking
 
05:12:09.670 --> 05:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
these children and your medically moving
 
05:12:11.670 --> 05:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
from one stereotypical box and putting
 
05:12:13.830 --> 05:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
them into another when they can just be
 
05:12:17.990 --> 05:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
what they want to be you know I I I
 
05:12:20.510 --> 05:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely oppose this bill I mean I
 
05:12:22.030 --> 05:12:22.040 align:start position:0%

like I said I've been researching in
 
05:12:35.270 --> 05:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
finding this for the last four years
 
05:12:38.150 --> 05:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
I've even gone to as far as DC to push
 
05:12:40.510 --> 05:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
for the block of PU blockers this is a
 
05:12:42.470 --> 05:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
medical Scandal happening across the
 
05:12:44.390 --> 05:12:44.400 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire um I strongly oppose this
 
05:13:26.350 --> 05:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
bill HB
 
05:13:29.510 --> 05:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
68 ladies and gentlemen of the committee

05:13:39.590 --> 05:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
testimony um this bill that has been
 
05:13:41.390 --> 05:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
introduced wants to make any treatment
 
05:13:42.868 --> 05:13:42.878 align:start position:0%
that would alleviate the gender
 
05:13:45.670 --> 05:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
dysphoria in a transgender or nonbinary
 
05:13:47.910 --> 05:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
child be illegal and counted as child
 
05:13:50.788 --> 05:13:50.798 align:start position:0%
abuse this is absolutely ridiculous not
 
05:13:52.470 --> 05:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
only because it would violate the rights
 
05:13:54.430 --> 05:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
of every single child that does not fit
 
05:13:56.548 --> 05:13:56.558 align:start position:0%
into the black and white gender binary
 
05:13:58.310 --> 05:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
that the society is
 
05:14:00.990 --> 05:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
currently accepting as the norm but it
 
05:14:02.670 --> 05:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
would also incriminate parents who are
 
05:14:04.270 --> 05:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
just trying to be supportive of their
 
05:14:08.110 --> 05:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
children my son has been who was born
 
05:14:10.310 --> 05:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
female was saying that they were a boy
 
05:14:12.590 --> 05:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
since they were four years old this is
 
05:14:15.548 --> 05:14:15.558 align:start position:0%
actually common as psychologists show
 
05:14:18.670 --> 05:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
that children show Express their gender
 
05:14:20.788 --> 05:14:20.798 align:start position:0%
around preschool
 
05:14:24.310 --> 05:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
age um we tried a lot of things we tried
 
05:14:26.830 --> 05:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
I you know I'm like a very strong
 
05:14:28.430 --> 05:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
feminist I was like well maybe we just
 
05:14:30.510 --> 05:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
need to empower and make sure that they
 
05:14:32.510 --> 05:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
see strong representations of women
 
05:14:35.310 --> 05:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
which in fact they have and were given
 
05:14:37.390 --> 05:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
but that did not fix the problem the
 
05:14:39.708 --> 05:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
Tinkerbell skateboards
 
05:14:41.948 --> 05:14:41.958 align:start position:0%
um and all of that did not change the
 
05:14:45.708 --> 05:14:45.718 align:start position:0%
fact that my son was in fact my
 
05:14:45.718 --> 05:14:47.628 align:start position:0%
fact that my son was in fact my
son

05:14:47.628 --> 05:14:47.638 align:start position:0%
son
 
05:14:50.590 --> 05:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
um Title Nine actually protect protects
 
05:14:52.510 --> 05:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
citizens on the basis of sex and gender
 
05:14:55.510 --> 05:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
but also gender identity um Title Nine
 
05:14:57.990 --> 05:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
of the education Amendments of 1972 and
 
05:14:58.000 --> 05:14:58.948 align:start position:0%
of the education Amendments of 1972 and
in

05:14:58.948 --> 05:14:58.958 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:15:01.830 --> 05:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
2016 um then President Obama did make it
 
05:15:04.270 --> 05:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
clear that he wanted to um include
 
05:15:06.750 --> 05:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
transgender people of all ages under
 
05:15:10.750 --> 05:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation they stated then that a
 
05:15:13.390 --> 05:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
um about schools um which said a
 
05:15:14.670 --> 05:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
president a school must not treat
 
05:15:16.150 --> 05:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
transgender students differently from
 
05:15:17.708 --> 05:15:17.718 align:start position:0%
the way it treats other
 
05:15:21.708 --> 05:15:21.718 align:start position:0%
students um also I would like to bring
 
05:15:23.470 --> 05:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
up the fact that transgender and
 
05:15:25.830 --> 05:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
nonbinary individuals have always
 
05:15:27.310 --> 05:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
existed throughout the world and
 
05:15:29.750 --> 05:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
throughout history just because in our
 
05:15:32.390 --> 05:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
society or our country we have not maybe
 
05:15:36.070 --> 05:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
not heard of these people or it's not in
 
05:15:37.750 --> 05:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
mainstream culture does not mean that
 
05:15:39.590 --> 05:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
they have not existed
 
05:15:41.750 --> 05:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
in fact Medical Science have proven that
 
05:15:43.110 --> 05:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
there are at least six distinct
 
05:15:46.270 --> 05:15:46.280 align:start position:0%
biological Sexes and any number
 
05:15:49.750 --> 05:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
Limitless gender Expressions before um
 
05:15:51.590 --> 05:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
Europeans colonized the globe thousands
 
05:15:53.628 --> 05:15:53.638 align:start position:0%
of indigenous people actually
 
05:15:55.510 --> 05:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledged and celebrated multiple
 
05:15:57.350 --> 05:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
gender identities as part of their
 
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
culture um a lot of this was erased when
 
05:16:02.030 --> 05:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
they were colonized but there are many
 
05:16:04.150 --> 05:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
Native people today um who do
 
05:16:06.990 --> 05:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledge two spirit people and other
 
05:16:10.910 --> 05:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
um definitions all over the globe um a
 
05:16:13.548 --> 05:16:13.558 align:start position:0%
famous two spirit Fred Martinez for
 
05:16:15.430 --> 05:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
example was not a boy who wanted to be a
 
05:16:18.110 --> 05:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
girl but both a boy and a girl in ident
 
05:16:20.270 --> 05:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
identity his Navajo culture recognized
 
05:16:24.190 --> 05:16:24.200 align:start position:0%
and re revered as nadle he meanwhile
 
05:16:26.310 --> 05:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
Hina of Kina is a part of native
 
05:16:27.990 --> 05:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
Hawaiian culture that has traditionally
 
05:16:30.470 --> 05:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
revered and respected mahu those who
 
05:16:34.390 --> 05:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
embody both Fe male and female Spirit um
 
05:16:36.230 --> 05:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
I have included in my testimony a map
 
05:16:38.390 --> 05:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
for reference where you can see people
 
05:16:39.830 --> 05:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
all over the World throughout history
 
05:16:41.548 --> 05:16:41.558 align:start position:0%
who have existed outside of the male
 
05:16:44.070 --> 05:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
female binary and some of these people
 
05:16:46.868 --> 05:16:46.878 align:start position:0%
were very revered and respected by their
 
05:16:50.628 --> 05:16:50.638 align:start position:0%
society um as they held important roles
 
05:16:54.350 --> 05:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
in the society including being Healers
 
05:16:57.788 --> 05:16:57.798 align:start position:0%
of others um I just I find it
 
05:17:01.070 --> 05:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking that we are only seeing
 
05:17:02.948 --> 05:17:02.958 align:start position:0%
these through our narrow
 
05:17:05.150 --> 05:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
definition um hormone blockers or
 
05:17:07.670 --> 05:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
hormone treatment can often be but is
 
05:17:09.590 --> 05:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
not the only approach roate course for
 
05:17:12.390 --> 05:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
transgender pre-teens and teens my child
 
05:17:14.310 --> 05:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
is now 13 so we've been doing this for
 
05:17:16.510 --> 05:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
N9 years and being the research nerd
 
05:17:18.070 --> 05:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
that I am I have been researching this
 
05:17:20.510 --> 05:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
extensively for nine years as
 
05:17:20.520 --> 05:17:23.310 align:start position:0%
extensively for nine years as
well

05:17:23.310 --> 05:17:23.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:17:26.070 --> 05:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
um they don't just let you get hormone
 
05:17:28.470 --> 05:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
blockers they make you their child you
 
05:17:31.708 --> 05:17:31.718 align:start position:0%
and your child go to therapy to many
 
05:17:34.070 --> 05:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
many doctors which we have gone through
 
05:17:36.510 --> 05:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
in many sessions and to make sure that
 
05:17:39.190 --> 05:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
the child and yourself um and your
 
05:17:41.030 --> 05:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
parenting skills are up to par they make
 
05:17:43.230 --> 05:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
sure that your child is psychologically
 
05:17:44.788 --> 05:17:44.798 align:start position:0%
sound and healthy they make sure that
 
05:17:47.430 --> 05:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
your child is physically healthy hormone
 
05:17:48.990 --> 05:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
blockers in and of themselves simply
 
05:17:50.990 --> 05:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
delay puberty and are used for a variety
 
05:17:53.470 --> 05:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
of reasons be besides gender identity as
 
05:17:55.750 --> 05:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
well including precocious or early
 
05:17:58.788 --> 05:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
puberty in girls especially whose bodies
 
05:18:00.430 --> 05:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
are more easily affected by the
 
05:18:02.150 --> 05:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
pesticides in our environment and in the
 
05:18:05.270 --> 05:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
hormones that we eat the most important
 
05:18:07.948 --> 05:18:07.958 align:start position:0%
thing is protecting transgender children
 
05:18:09.990 --> 05:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is not a protection as other
 
05:18:12.868 --> 05:18:12.878 align:start position:0%
people have said it is abuse posing as
 
05:18:14.990 --> 05:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
protection the rate of transgender
 
05:18:16.390 --> 05:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
suicide has been shown to be
 
05:18:18.070 --> 05:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
significantly higher than the rates for
 
05:18:18.080 --> 05:18:18.830 align:start position:0%
significantly higher than the rates for
other

05:18:18.830 --> 05:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:18:21.830 --> 05:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
hormones I'm sorry than the rates for
 
05:18:24.750 --> 05:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
other youth five times higher compared
 
05:18:28.270 --> 05:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
to their heterosexual dis gender peers
 
05:18:29.628 --> 05:18:29.638 align:start position:0%
however parents who support their
 
05:18:31.390 --> 05:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
children's true identities can mitigate
 
05:18:33.470 --> 05:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
the risk of self harm and attempted
 
05:18:36.430 --> 05:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
suicide um I've quoted Dr Caitlyn Ryan
 
05:18:38.390 --> 05:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
in the family acceptance project which
 
05:18:40.830 --> 05:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
found that lgbtq youth whose families
 
05:18:42.990 --> 05:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
affirm their gender identity and sexual
 
05:18:45.948 --> 05:18:45.958 align:start position:0%
orientation are almost 50% less likely
 
05:18:48.150 --> 05:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
to make a suicide attempt compared to
 
05:18:49.788 --> 05:18:49.798 align:start position:0%
those whose families are
 
05:18:52.030 --> 05:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
unsupported acceptance and receiving
 
05:18:54.990 --> 05:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate Medical Care and enum
 
05:18:56.628 --> 05:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
therapy can quite literally save the
 
05:18:58.350 --> 05:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
lives of transgender and non-gender
 
05:19:00.948 --> 05:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
conforming children and teens children
 
05:19:02.548 --> 05:19:02.558 align:start position:0%
know who they are and they need to be
 
05:19:04.470 --> 05:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
supported taking away the rights of
 
05:19:07.350 --> 05:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
transgender children is abuse supporting
 
05:19:09.470 --> 05:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
them is love please do not allow the
 
05:19:11.270 --> 05:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
hatred and ignorance of a small group of
 
05:19:14.350 --> 05:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
individuals who have no
 
05:19:17.230 --> 05:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
scientific medical or
 
05:19:21.390 --> 05:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
psychological um standing overall to
 
05:19:24.390 --> 05:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
abuse good people children and their
 
05:19:26.548 --> 05:19:26.558 align:start position:0%
