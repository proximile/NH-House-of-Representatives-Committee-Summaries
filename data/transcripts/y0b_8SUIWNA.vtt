00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
very much jennifer i just wanted to
 
00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:07.590 align:start position:0%
very much jennifer i just wanted to
clarify

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that when it comes to
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
requesting any kind of research
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
we should go through the chairman um
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
i assume that doesn't mean that if we
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
have questions about to you about
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
various smaller issues we don't have to
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
go through the chairman for that i
 
00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:24.710 align:start position:0%
go through the chairman for that i
assume

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
assume
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
that's correct that would be kind of
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
cumbersome so
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
can you can you kind of explain the
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
difference when we should go through the
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
chairman and when we don't need to do
 
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.509 align:start position:0%
chairman and when we don't need to do
that

00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
sure that's an excellent point um so if
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a bill and
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
so you just have a specific question
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
about a bill or have a question
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
about finding a certain citation where
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
can i see
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know the rest of the law that that
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
this would fall into
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
um can you get me a phone number for
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
such and such a person
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
things like that i'm happy to take on
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
individually um if there's going to be a
 
00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:02.790 align:start position:0%
individually um if there's going to be a
more

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
lengthy in-depth memo that needs to be
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
generated um
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
just a more substantial research project
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
that should
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
that should go through the chair okay
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
all right thank you guys i'm going to
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
stay on the call i'll just turn off my
 
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
video though
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
thank you jennifer thank you very much
 
00:16:33.839 --> 00:16:34.470 align:start position:0%
thank you jennifer thank you very much
jen

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
jen
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
all right so i'd like to spend a little
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
bit of time now talking about some
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
specifics about how we operate the
 
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:47.990 align:start position:0%
specifics about how we operate the
committee

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
we're also going to talk about uh
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
the way house leadership envisions the
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee process
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
unfolding this year and it's going to be
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
quite different
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
from what we have experienced in the
 
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.470 align:start position:0%
from what we have experienced in the
past

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
but before we get to that one of our
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
traditions in this committee
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
at the start of every day is to
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
do the pledge of allegiance we did not
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
do the pledge of allegiance this morning
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
because of the unusual nature of the
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh of this meeting but i would like to
 
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.029 align:start position:0%
uh of this meeting but i would like to
now

00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
call on representative doug thomas to
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
lead us in the pledge
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
of allegiance and i would like you all
 
00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:32.549 align:start position:0%

mute your microphone and say the the
 
00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:35.990 align:start position:0%
mute your microphone and say the the
pledge

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%

00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%

00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thomas we will
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
always begin our meetings with
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
a pledge
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
so let's talk a little bit about the
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
committee meetings themselves when will
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
they happen
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
in the past those of us who have been on
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
for some time uh have gotten used to two
 
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
and sometimes three committee meetings a
 
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.430 align:start position:0%
and sometimes three committee meetings a
week

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
but due to the uh nature of the covet 19
 
00:18:41.679 --> 00:18:42.789 align:start position:0%
but due to the uh nature of the covet 19
pandemic

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
and the need to keep people safe and to
 
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.909 align:start position:0%
and the need to keep people safe and to
restrict

00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
how we gather where we gather and when
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
we gather
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
house leadership has determined that
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
committees will only be allowed to meet
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
we have not yet been assigned a day of
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
the week
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
it will probably be monday a tuesday
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
or a wednesday possibly a friday
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
we will let you know as soon as we know
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
so that you can clear your schedules
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
for that particular day
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
our meetings will start at nine o'clock
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
in the morning
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
and they will run until five o'clock in
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
the afternoon
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
we will try to take a couple of breaks
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
during the day
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
we have 32 bills to vet over the course
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
of approximately six weeks
 
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
our meeting days will be long we will be
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
doing four five or six public hearings
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
per day on the days we meet
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
some of those public hearings may be
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
short some may be long
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
but you can count on our meeting days
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
being quite long
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
so where will we meet the house is
 
00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.390 align:start position:0%
so where will we meet the house is
currently

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
house leadership is currently setting up
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
a system
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
whereby committees will be allowed to
 
00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:17.270 align:start position:0%
whereby committees will be allowed to
meet

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
meet
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
in a double-sized room and the
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
and that room will have tables set up
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
so that legislators can be socially
 
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.990 align:start position:0%
so that legislators can be socially
distanced

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
distanced
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
there is some uh talk also about the
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
possibility that the
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
the rooms may have plexiglass
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
installed between members
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
uh to further uh isolate
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
members from each other
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
attendance at these meetings will be
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
optional that these in-person meetings
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
optional if you would prefer to
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
attend the meeting via zoom that option
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
will be available to you
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
but if you want to attend in person you
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
they will only be allowing two
 
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
committees per
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
floor per day so
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
on the day that our committee meets
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
there will be one other committee
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
meeting on the same floor
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
and there will be two committees meeting
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
on the floor below or above
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
the one we will be assigned to
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
so there will be very limited
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
um numbers of
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
people in the building attendance will
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
be limited to
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
members and staff the general public
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
will not be allowed to attend in person
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
so all presentations to the committee
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
will be done
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
via electronic delivery
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
there will be a 60 inch monitor monitor
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
in the committee room
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
so that people who attend the committee
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
meeting via
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh in person rather will will listen to
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
all the presentations
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
on the video screen
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
that's in the room people attending the
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
meeting via zoom will see it on their on
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
their home screen
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
so there will be no members of the
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
public and no
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
presenters who attend the meeting
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a very different way
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
of doing things and
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
our first couple of meetings
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
basically amount to an experiment to see
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
how well this is going to work
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
but we will all work hard to try to make
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
it work
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
because it's in all of our best
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
interests to do so it will keep us safe
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
and that's of paramount importance to
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
house leadership
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
and to the leadership of this committee
 
00:22:59.120 --> 00:22:59.590 align:start position:0%
and to the leadership of this committee
so

00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
i want everybody to feel comfortable
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
want everybody to feel safe
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
and we will do everything we can to make
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
sure that that
 
00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:11.270 align:start position:0%
sure that that
happens

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
if you do decide to attend the committee
 
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.110 align:start position:0%
if you do decide to attend the committee
meeting

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
in person we encourage you to
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
follow traditional house rules about
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
dress and dress business casual
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
for men that typically means ties and
 
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
sport goats
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
and for women there's a plethora
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
of business casual options that
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
i'm sure all of the members of this
 
00:23:41.279 --> 00:23:43.110 align:start position:0%
i'm sure all of the members of this
committee

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
when we address members uh and
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
each other uh and members of the public
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
we follow rules of decorum
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
we request permission of the chair
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
to speak and uh
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
when we ask a question we thank the
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
person who's
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
receiving the question for taking the
 
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.070 align:start position:0%
receiving the question for taking the
question

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
and we thank them for their answer once
 
00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.750 align:start position:0%
and we thank them for their answer once
they've

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
they've
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
given us a question or giving us an
 
00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:22.789 align:start position:0%
given us a question or giving us an
answer

00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:26.549 align:start position:0%
answer
answer

00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
as was noted earlier when we do have
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
executive sessions and votes
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
all votes will be via roll call
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
members who are in the room
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
will vote simply by answering the call
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
of the clerk members online will vote
 
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
the same way
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
but they will have to remember to unmute
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
their microphones before they
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
as in the past if you are attending a
 
00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.350 align:start position:0%
as in the past if you are attending a
meeting

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
in person no food will be allowed
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
in the committee room you can bring
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
a bottle of water um but
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
you won't be allowed to eat in the
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
committee room
 
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
we will make arrangements for taking a
 
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
lunch break
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
during the course of a long eight hour
 
00:25:21.279 --> 00:25:24.549 align:start position:0%
during the course of a long eight hour
day

00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
and we will let you know where in the
 
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.070 align:start position:0%
and we will let you know where in the
building

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
it is permissible to eat once we know
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
that ourselves right now we don't know
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
if you do have to leave the committee
 
00:25:39.679 --> 00:25:40.789 align:start position:0%
if you do have to leave the committee
room

00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
during the course of a a meeting
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
you were you will be required to wear a
 
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
mask so if you need to go to the
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
restroom as you walk out of the
 
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
committee room into the hallway you
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
should put on a mask
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
you can remove the mask once you return
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
portable electronics are also allowed in
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
the committee room
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
iphones and or phones um
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
pads but we discourage their use
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
on a routine basis checking your email
 
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
looking at facebook we discourage that
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
it's okay if you need to look something
 
00:26:25.039 --> 00:26:25.669 align:start position:0%
it's okay if you need to look something
up

00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
do some research during the course of a
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
but um please don't sit there on your
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
phone the whole time
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh that you're engaged in a public
 
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.149 align:start position:0%
uh that you're engaged in a public
hearing

00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go over some other
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines that we've been
 
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
developing for public hearings
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
and as i indicated before this is uh
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
these guidelines that we've come up with
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
are ideas that we think will help
 
00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.630 align:start position:0%
are ideas that we think will help
facilitate

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
facilitate
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
given the extreme conditions under which
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to be meeting
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
long committee days many many public
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
hearings in a single day
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
occasionally during a
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
session day we will also have
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
those can be called at any time and will
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
be called
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
during the course of our meetings so
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
that we can dispose of our bills
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
but because of these tough conditions
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
we're likely going to have to come up
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
with some different rules about how to
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
operate a public hearing
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
so some broad outlines that we've come
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
up with
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
are as follows anybody planning to
 
00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.870 align:start position:0%
are as follows anybody planning to
testify

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
before the committee should submit
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
written testimony to the committee
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
now we've always encouraged written
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
testimony in the past
 
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
but this year we're going to make
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
written testimony a mandate because
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to probably restrict
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
verbal testimony so in order for
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
someone to provide us with the most
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
and the best information possible about
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
a given bill
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to need to produce a
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
written document
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
now some people already do this
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
department agencies uh and department
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
representatives frequently submit
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
written testimony it's very thorough
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
and very useful and helpful
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
other people less so
 
00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of their written testimony but
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
this year we're going to try to
 
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
encourage people to
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
do as much written testimony as possible
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
a prime sponsor who introduces a bill
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
will be permitted
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
five minutes to introduce the
 
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.190 align:start position:0%
five minutes to introduce the
legislation

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
you'll be encouraged to highlight three
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
or four important points from their
 
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.310 align:start position:0%
or four important points from their
written

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
testimony and limit it
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
to that because five minutes goes by
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
for or against the bill will be limited
 
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.190 align:start position:0%
for or against the bill will be limited
to

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
three minutes and they'll be encouraged
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
to highlight maybe two points
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
anybody who is testifying
 
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
and repeats points made by a previous
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
committee members will be allowed two
 
00:29:58.559 --> 00:29:59.669 align:start position:0%
committee members will be allowed two
questions

00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
for a presenter and any follow-up
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
question must arrive directly from an
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
answer to a previous question
 
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
statements like uh would you believe
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
that do not provide immediate contacts
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
must not proceed will not be accepted
 
00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
they will not be allowed and members
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
must not
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
engage in debate with presenters but
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
shall endeavor only to clarify
 
00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:28.820 align:start position:0%
factual information presented
 
00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.230 align:start position:0%
factual information presented
[Music]

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm seeing that we've already uh got
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
some questions out there so
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
um let's answer a couple of questions
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
before we
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
we move on here uh representative
 
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
jackie callie pitts do you have a
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
question yes i do
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
um the the testimony that we're going to
 
00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.870 align:start position:0%
um the the testimony that we're going to
require

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
i have a comment one is i think it's
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
hamper some of the general public that
 
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
report and secondly how do we how are we
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
going to get copies
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
of this testimony so that we can go over
 
00:31:10.159 --> 00:31:11.990 align:start position:0%
of this testimony so that we can go over
it

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question uh i
 
00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.909 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question uh i
anticipate

00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
that if presenters comply with our
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
requirement to
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh submit written written testimony 24
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
hours in advance that we would
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
distribute that testimony to all members
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
of the committee by
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
email so that they would have time
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
to read it digest it formulate questions
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
that they want to
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
ask before the actual committee vote and
 
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:46.710 align:start position:0%
ask before the actual committee vote and
if

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know we'll encourage people to
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
submit their test
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
written testimony even um
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
more in advance than 24 hours if they if
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
they want
 
00:31:59.669 --> 00:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
the sooner they submit written testimony
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
the better we can distribute it to all
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
and people will have more time to read
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
it and digest it
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
remember to mute your uh yourself
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
once you've finished speaking
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
representative samson your question yes
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned um the this
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
scenario of meeting in person in these
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
committee rooms
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
at the lob so i have
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
two questions here and number one my
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the lop
 
00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
has been determined to be an unhealthy
 
00:32:37.519 --> 00:32:38.549 align:start position:0%
has been determined to be an unhealthy
building

00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
due to a lack of air circulation
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
so i don't know how we can ensure that
 
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
the building is actually a
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
safe building to meet in and second if i
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
understood you correctly you mentioned
 
00:32:51.919 --> 00:32:53.029 align:start position:0%
understood you correctly you mentioned
that

00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
mass squaring would not be required in
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
room while where we are meeting but only
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
the hallways and when when exits to go
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
to the rare house room is that correct
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for those uh questions
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
representative sanchez
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
to your first question the house
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
leadership has
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
and house staff has recently installed
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
ultraviolet light air purifiers
 
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.110 align:start position:0%
ultraviolet light air purifiers
ultraviolet

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
ultraviolet
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
radiation air purifiers throughout all
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
the committee rooms in the house
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
they so i'm told
 
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
they clean the air five times per hour
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
and the house staff has determined
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
how staff and leadership is determined
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
that that will do an
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
adequate job to uh cleaning the air
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
so that house the legislative office
 
00:33:51.679 --> 00:33:52.310 align:start position:0%
so that house the legislative office
building

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
committee rooms will be safe to use
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
with regard to mask wearing since
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
members will be separated from each
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
other by a minimum of six feet
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
and possibly by plexiglas barriers
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
it is going to be permissible to remove
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
your mask
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
once you are sitted seated at in your
 
00:34:18.399 --> 00:34:19.190 align:start position:0%
once you are sitted seated at in your
seat

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
seat
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
at the committee roundtable because
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
um between the air purifying technology
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
and the distance you'll be residing
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
between yourself and another member
 
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
plus the barriers that will be in place
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
house leadership feels comfortable that
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
that will be
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
sufficient to protect members from
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
the spread of any disease
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman i just can i just clarify
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
this again
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
um being that we are the science
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
technology energy committee
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
i would be very interested in
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
specifications and
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
and details about what these uh
 
00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.550 align:start position:0%
and details about what these uh
ultraviolet

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
ultraviolet
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
uh machines are are who makes them who
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
certifies them
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
and whether we have an independent um
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
certification that this is an effective
 
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
way of removing
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
i worked for a company that made uv
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
lights so i know something about them
 
00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.190 align:start position:0%
lights so i know something about them
but

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
this is a unique situation with the
 
00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.710 align:start position:0%
this is a unique situation with the
virus

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
virus
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
i don't think that any uh uh staff
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's not technically competent to
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
evaluate it can say one way or the other
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to be safe or not

the use of the machines and being in the
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
building has been cleared by the state

experiment that proves one way or
 
00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:28.550 align:start position:0%
experiment that proves one way or
another

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
was there a question there
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
representative manager

thanks for taking my question chair bose
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
um i just want to clarify how the
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
process will go for asking questions of
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
presenters during hearings
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
you said that you're limiting the number
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
of questions to each of the
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
representatives to two questions is that
 
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.310 align:start position:0%
representatives to two questions is that
correct

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question that is
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
correct and is there a time limit for
 
00:38:16.839 --> 00:38:20.870 align:start position:0%
correct and is there a time limit for
questions

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
no we haven't come up with a specific
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
time limit for questions
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
typically a question doesn't take that
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
long uh
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
there will be about a one to two minute
 
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:31.430 align:start position:0%
there will be about a one to two minute
limit

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
on the answer to the question from the
 
00:38:33.599 --> 00:38:34.630 align:start position:0%
on the answer to the question from the
presenter

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
presenter
 
00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
but the question itself i hadn't
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
anticipated that we need we would need
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
to put a time limit on
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
on the question itself
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you yes thank you
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
any additional questions
 
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and that is oxenum

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh two things uh follow-up to
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
representative samson's question he
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
asked about the air quality which is
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
completely separate
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
from uh the covet issue the the building
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
has been determined not to have air
 
00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.589 align:start position:0%
has been determined not to have air
circulation

00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
circulation
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
i i would ask that that also be looked
 
00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.270 align:start position:0%
i i would ask that that also be looked
into

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
and the second part was about the limit
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
on questions
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
will it be one question from people in
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
the room and one question from those
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
that aren't in the room will it be one
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
question from a republican one question
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
from a democrat is there any
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh process there thank you very much for
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for those uh questions an
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
answer to your first
 
00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:44.150 align:start position:0%
answer to your first
question

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
we will disseminate any information that
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
we get from house leadership
 
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
about the quality
 
00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:56.079 align:start position:0%
of the environment in
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
the legislative office building as
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
representative thomas pointed out
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
dhhs and some medical doctors have
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
evaluated the building with its new um
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
uv radiation cleansing machines
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
and determine that it's safe i would
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
remind everybody
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
that attendance at the lob is optional
 
00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.630 align:start position:0%
that attendance at the lob is optional
so

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
if you don't feel safe just stay home
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
and attend
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
our public hearings via zoom uh
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
that should work for just about
 
00:40:29.839 --> 00:40:30.870 align:start position:0%
that should work for just about
everybody

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
this hybrid model should make it safe
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
for everybody
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
but also uh make the public hearing
 
00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.750 align:start position:0%
but also uh make the public hearing
process

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
as open and as informative
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
as it can be some people prefer
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
being in attendance with other people
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
when they're in a public hearing
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
other people might choose to stay home
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
because they feel they're safer that way
 
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:56.470 align:start position:0%
because they feel they're safer that way
so

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
you have the option of doing either
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
staff however excuse me staff however
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
would not have that option
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
as i understand it they they are
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i'm not sure the
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
answer to that i believe staff and
 
00:41:16.079 --> 00:41:17.030 align:start position:0%
answer to that i believe staff and
jennifer

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
jennifer
 
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
she's still on here i can't tell if
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
she's still on uh
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
here mr post excuse me thank you uh
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
jennifer uh can you answer
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham's question about
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
right now we have staff
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
coming in staff working from home
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a big mixture right now um
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
and i i don't think i have a better
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
answer than that i'm in the building
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
but i could be working from home um
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
for instance i'll be working from home
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
next week
 
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
in terms of running the equipment those
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
details are still being
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
sorted out so
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's very likely that a big portion of
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
staff will continue
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
working remotely or coming in
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
one or two days a week mornings things
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
everyone's on a little bit of a
 
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
different schedule
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
if i made just one more follow-up mr
 
00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:27.750 align:start position:0%
if i made just one more follow-up mr
chairman

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
yes the question about air circulation
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
is is
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
really an important one because you may
 
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
be cleaning the air
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
five times an hour but if it's the same
 
00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.309 align:start position:0%
five times an hour but if it's the same
air

00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
air
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
there are other issues uh that that are
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
that we're putting our staff and those
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
who choose to be there
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
at risk and thank you and i'll conclude
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative you raise a
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
good point and i think what we should do
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
is we should get clarification and
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
documentation from
 
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
house leadership and dhhs
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
about these machines and the quality of
 
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
the air that they
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
produce and once we have that
 
00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.150 align:start position:0%
produce and once we have that
information

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
and we can share it um broadly with the
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
um everybody will know where we stand
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative nader
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you somewhere in my office i have
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
the paperwork on the machines
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
i just couldn't find it i even looked in
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
the other room um i've we've been
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
assured that
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
the machines actually kill coven so
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
and they're putting in extra ones more
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
than that than was required
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
for the size of the rooms but again the
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative knotter
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
representative thomas
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
i thank you mr chair i just wanted to
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
add just
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of information on
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
people in the building
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
although this may not happen much or
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
it may be rare if a representative
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
is in the building because he or she is
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
in another committee on that day
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
and one of that one of the bills that he
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
or she may have submitted
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
is up that representative will be
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to come into the committee room
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
in person and introduce that bill
 
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
that's only if he was or he or she
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
happened to be in the building that day
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
when that bill is being introduced
 
00:44:34.319 --> 00:44:35.589 align:start position:0%
when that bill is being introduced
because

00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
they're in another committee meeting so
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to get that point
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh across it's um won't happen often i'm
 
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
sure but it could happen and you should
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
be aware that you are able to do that
 
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
that word came from the speaker
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thomas
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chairman i'm i'm
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
concerned about the limit on the number
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
of questions
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
since because i know from experience
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
presenters especially the ones who are
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
employees of various companies etc
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes know very artfully how to
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
escape or to
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh convolute an issue and that
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
you sometimes you need to get vacation
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
especially on issues that we deal with
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's not cut and dry
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
so i i'm concerned about that it's going
 
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:41.670 align:start position:0%
so i i'm concerned about that it's going
to

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
limit the ability to the matter and some
 
00:45:45.599 --> 00:45:46.069 align:start position:0%
limit the ability to the matter and some
of

00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
these issues that we deal with and i
 
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
want to know if that's hard and fast
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for that expression of concern
 
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
and i will say that none of these rules
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
none of these guidelines that i've gone
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
over here this morning are hard and fast
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
this whole process is brand new to all
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
of us
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
so we're going to have to try it
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
and see what works the overriding
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
concern here is we're only meeting once
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
a week and if we have 32 bills to do
 
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
that means basically we have to
 
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
have public hearings on five or six
 
00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.109 align:start position:0%
have public hearings on five or six
bills

00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
every week now in order to get those
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
public hearings in
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
we may have to limit the number of
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
questions that get asked
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
we may have to limit the length of
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
testimony that gets offered
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
and it's simply a matter of getting
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
through the day
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
and it is these guidelines that i just
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
spoke about
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh while we will follow them initially
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
if for some reason we determine they're
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
not working and we can come up with a
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
better way of doing things
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
we'll do that but we've got to
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
have some kind of a system in place if
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to have any chance
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
of getting through all 32 bills during
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
the course
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
of six what amounts to about six
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
committee session days so
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
i urge everyone's to be
 
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
everyone to be um
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
understanding about our situation i urge
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
everyone to pitch in
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
and try to to help us all do the best
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
that we can to get through
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
this difficult time um
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
the house deadlines are hard and fast we
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
have to be done with all of our
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
committee work by march 23rd i think the
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
date is
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
so we have we have few options here
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh if we're going to be restricted to
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
just one day a week
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
so mr chair all right representative
 
00:48:00.079 --> 00:48:00.870 align:start position:0%
so mr chair all right representative
thomas

00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
thomas
 
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um thank you for uh
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
recognizing me
 
00:48:07.349 --> 00:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh i uh if if you will i would just like
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
to make a general statement uh perhaps
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
more so
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
for our uh attendees and um
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
people that might be bringing um
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
you know testimony to our floor on a
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
regular basis
 
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
i know i think everyone here that's been
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
here knows in the past
 
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes sometimes uh time is taken up
 
00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.589 align:start position:0%
sometimes sometimes uh time is taken up
by

00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
going over his history uh
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
maybe they're lamenting on certain
 
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
things that may have happened or didn't
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
happen before in the past
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
that takes up a lot of time i would
 
00:48:40.079 --> 00:48:41.270 align:start position:0%
that takes up a lot of time i would
suggest

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
for people that are giving testimony
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
that they get right to the point
 
00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
of what they really want to say and what
 
00:48:50.309 --> 00:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
the points are that are really important
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
for them
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
either in support of or not support of a
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
certain bill
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
and that should take away a lot of
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
time that they may have used before in
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
the past
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
i think it's important this year that we
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
work together
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
to get through this and understand that
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
it's not business as usual and we're
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
trying to be consistently fair
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
across the entire spectrum so uh just
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
like we
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
may need to limit our type or length of
 
00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:20.309 align:start position:0%
may need to limit our type or length of
questions

00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
i would ask the attendees to consider uh
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
the most important points that they need
 
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
to get across
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
realizing that they have the written
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
testimony to fill in the
 
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know the extra information it's a
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative thomas we
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
have any more
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
questions or important points to make
 
00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.589 align:start position:0%
questions or important points to make
about

00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:49:46.549 --> 00:49:46.559 align:start position:0%
our situation here uh representative
 
00:49:46.559 --> 00:49:50.549 align:start position:0%
our situation here uh representative
oxenom

00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much mr chair on
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
this question uh
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
again of if if you're the prime sponsor
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
and you want to bring experts to testify
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
in support of your bill are are they
 
00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:03.670 align:start position:0%
in support of your bill are are they
limited

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
limited
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
in the same way as the questions are and
 
00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
secondarily i didn't really get an
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
answer to the earlier question about the
 
00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:11.589 align:start position:0%
answer to the earlier question about the
two

00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
people allowed to question whether they
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
would be one republican one democrat
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
one person out of the room one person in
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
the room one personal lobbyist one
 
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
person a member of the public
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
is there any hard and fast or at least
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
guideline on that
 
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for that question
 
00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:28.870 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for that question
representative

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
i didn't say that questions would be
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
limited to two people i said
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
each member will be limited to two
 
00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:37.190 align:start position:0%
each member will be limited to two
questions

00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
so every member of the committee all
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
what 21 of us could ask up to two
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
questions during the course of a public
 
00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:46.390 align:start position:0%
questions during the course of a public
hearing

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of question that's a lot of
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
time actually um
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly hopeful that not everybody
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
not all 21 of us would be would feel it
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
necessary to ask questions and hopefully
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
if we get good written testimony
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
submitted ahead of time
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
we won't have to ask that many questions
 
00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
i urge you all to remember every
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
question you ask
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
makes the public hearing last longer and
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
the longer the public hearing lasts
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
the longer our days become and the more
 
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.150 align:start position:0%
the longer our days become and the more
difficult

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
uh our weekly sessions near the end of
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
the uh as we approach the house deadline
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
the more difficult our sessions will
 
00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.109 align:start position:0%
the more difficult our sessions will
become

00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
become
 
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
so the reason we came up with a
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
guideline for questions
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
is to not to discourage people from
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
asking them
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
we certainly want people to get as much
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
information as possible
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
but just to be thoughtful about how
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
often you ask a question how many
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
questions you ask
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
and be
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
be thoughtful of the time constraints
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
so i answered that part of your question
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative and now i forgot the
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
you and me both thank you very much that
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
was very helpful
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative mann
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
this is the whole thing i'll have to
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
have a mallet to hit myself on the head
 
00:52:26.559 --> 00:52:27.190 align:start position:0%
have a mallet to hit myself on the head
with

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
um it it's clear that there's something
 
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
an ability of a zoom called screen chair
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
so it is possible
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
for uh me at home for example to give a
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
presentation that might have some
 
00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.349 align:start position:0%
presentation that might have some
visuals

00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
visuals
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
and uh people are testifying
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
um other people might also
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
want to use visuals and
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
whether this the screen share could be
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
somehow used
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know a video captured by video at
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
at the at the uh
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
at the legislative office building
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
and therefore transmitted to everybody
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
else that
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
is watching or somebody is asking a good
 
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
question or giving a presentation from
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
their home remotely they could also do
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
um a presentation just by having the
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
information put on a on a on powerpoint
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
or something like that instead of
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
on a large piece of um of
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
parchment so anyway the question is
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
basically if people looked into that
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
and it does seem to me it would be an
 
00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:51.750 align:start position:0%
and it does seem to me it would be an
easy

00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
easy
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
and easy process
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that query uh
 
00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:58.870 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that query uh
representative

00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that we will be
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
discouraging screen sharing
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh during presentations for the simple
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
reason that they will
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
dramatically increase the time that it
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
will take to make a presentation
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
instead we will encourage people to
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
submit materials
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
as part of their written testimony so if
 
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
graphs or tables or
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
other audio visual materials that they
 
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
want to share
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
we encourage we will encourage them to
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
share that by their written testimony
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
and will discourage the use of screen
 
00:54:34.559 --> 00:54:35.190 align:start position:0%
and will discourage the use of screen
sharing

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
sharing
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
during uh public hearing testimony
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
representative partial yes thank you mr
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
chairman uh and also thank you for
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
making the action available
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
through hybrid meetings i appreciate
 
00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.270 align:start position:0%
through hybrid meetings i appreciate
that

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
my question is um
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
written testimony will be disseminated
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
to uh representatives
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
um on the committee within 24 hours
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
but how will this information be
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
disseminated to attendees
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
is that been given some thought i'm sure
 
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
representative no we haven't given that
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
any thought because
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
typically it's not the committee's
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility to
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
share information with attendees
 
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
we only share information with other
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
it would be up to the presenter to share
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
information with
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
other people in whatever manner they
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
choose to do so
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll have more questions for
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
my uh for our
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
later on but thank you so much you're
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
very welcome thank you
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i took my hand
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
down and didn't take the mute off
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
nice to see everyone again um my
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
question was around i had heard that the
 
00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:54.230 align:start position:0%
question was around i had heard that the
senate

00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
um who's a little smaller and more
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
nimble they they've
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
adopted their processes around hearings
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
rather quickly
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
and i my question was they're using um
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
an online form which is similar to the
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
blue sheets so that people can sign in
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
on the hearing in terms of whether
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
they're in support or
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
opposed to a particular piece of
 
00:56:15.359 --> 00:56:16.470 align:start position:0%
opposed to a particular piece of
legislation

00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
and so i was wondering if there has been
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
any discussion about the house adopting
 
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
that type of an
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
option through our website and also
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
on the policy of folks who want to
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
testify being aware that they need to
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
submit things within a certain time
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
frame in order to be eligible to testify
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
if that's going to be something that we
 
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
try to use and i do
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
i do very much understand
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
the need to try and keep the um the
 
00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:45.510 align:start position:0%
the need to try and keep the um the
hearing

00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh testimony especially concise and so i
 
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
um but will there be policy listed so
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
understands how their access is supposed
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
to work
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
um and one last thing so i'll just get
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
it all out and then you can
 
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
you can deal with it and i'll try to
 
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
remember my my points
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
um you had mentioned that if someone
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
who's testifying starts repeating a
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
point that's already been brought up
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
that they basically would get the hook
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
and i i appreciate that too i wish we
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
had had that last term
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
but um but i'm curious uh if you could
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
say a little
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
more about how that type of a rule would
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
be applied
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
because i think what we do see is that
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
i think that our people who give
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
testimony in our committee especially
 
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
those who are repeat
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
um you know the lobbyists the folks who
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
know the issues
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
i think they're usually pretty good
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
about saying i'm not going to repeat
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
something that someone else has already
 
00:57:43.599 --> 00:57:44.549 align:start position:0%
something that someone else has already
mentioned

00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
but i just wondered if you could say a
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
little more about how that would be
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
applied because we do have
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
in-person versus online audiences so um
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm just wondering how that would be
 
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
done if someone's online will they just
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
be muted or
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
how will it happen thank you for your
 
00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.829 align:start position:0%
how will it happen thank you for your
question

00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative the first part of your
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
question about the senate's
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
policy we are aware of it and house
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
leadership is working on a
 
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
policy for the house we have
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
pink cards and blue sheets that we
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
need to replicate in an online
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
system of some sort i know the staff is
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
working on those
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
i do not know at this point in time
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
what solution they've come up with they
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
haven't announced it to us yet
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
but that is being
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
investigated and dealt with
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
to your question about people getting
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
the hook
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
which is a good way to put it obviously
 
00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
um we will be respectful
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
but if someone starts repeating points
 
00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
that i've heard before i'm just going to
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
simply ask the presenter to suspend
 
00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:08.799 align:start position:0%
and then i will ask them if they have
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
any new points
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
to offer rather than repeating points
 
00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:14.799 align:start position:0%
that have already been made
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
and give them that opportunity if they
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
choose to make a fresh point then we'll
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
let them but if they choose to
 
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
to repeat points that have already been
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
to end their testimony and move on to
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
the next person
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
as i said before this is all an
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
have to make the best of it to do the
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
best we can with it so
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
we are going to need to move on very
 
00:59:48.559 --> 00:59:49.109 align:start position:0%
we are going to need to move on very
soon

00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
soon
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
to our first presenter which is uh
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
the office of the consumer advocate so
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
i will call on those three people and
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
then we'll move on if that's okay with
 
01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.270 align:start position:0%
then we'll move on if that's okay with
uh

01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
with everybody on the committee so
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
representative samsich uh
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
go ahead yes thank you mr chairman i
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
just have a quick point i
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
totally agree with your your effort to
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
try to streamline everything as far as
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
the questions are concerned
 
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
however i would like to point out that
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
our committee
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
when it comes to these bills we are the
 
01:00:27.599 --> 01:00:29.030 align:start position:0%
when it comes to these bills we are the
primary

01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
primary
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
screening process for all these bills
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be much debate on
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
the floor we know that
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
so we need to do as good a job as we can
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
within the time constraints to figure
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
out these
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
bills and figure out what they do and
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
what they don't do
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
and that's our job that's our primary
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
job so
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
i think the way to deal with that is we
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
need to make a bigger effort to focus
 
01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:52.630 align:start position:0%
need to make a bigger effort to focus
our

01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
questions as precisely as possible in a
 
01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:56.309 align:start position:0%
questions as precisely as possible in a
short

01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
short
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
amount of time but we do need to get the
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
information needed for these bills
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
very good point and i thank you for that
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
representative thomas
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair i just wanted to
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
say primarily for benefit of the
 
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
freshmen that are on here
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
in the past on a particularly important
 
01:01:16.079 --> 01:01:16.870 align:start position:0%
in the past on a particularly important
bill

01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
many times the public feels that
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
by by having
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
10 maybe 15 people come down
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
to show support for the bill that they
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
all have to speak on it
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
and generally the information that
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
becomes repetitive is they tell
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
they tell us uh basically how they're
 
01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:38.710 align:start position:0%
they tell us uh basically how they're
affected

01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
affected
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
and it's generally the same type of
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
information although
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
everyone's situation is you know
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
different perhaps
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
we could help that by asking either the
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
attendees or any other organization that
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
is uh asking people to support
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
or not support us a certain bill to
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
be mindful of that fact and we would
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
love to have their written testimony
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
if it is the same thing then perhaps
 
01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.710 align:start position:0%
if it is the same thing then perhaps
only

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps only two or three that show the
 
01:02:09.839 --> 01:02:10.230 align:start position:0%
perhaps only two or three that show the
uh

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
the indications of how this bill is
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
affecting them would be sufficient in
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
terms of speaking
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the written testimonies
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
could be just supportive in
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
information that might be one way that
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
we can handle
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh people that have uh we should only do
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
since they don't have to drive the two
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
or three hours sometimes to come down
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
and testify
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
and they can be behind their computer um
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
they may feel a little better about the
 
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
fact that their point gets across by
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
a few representative people uh that's
 
01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
that's what
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
i would say about that one there thank
 
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:46.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.839 --> 01:02:52.069 align:start position:0%
 
plozas

01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i had a computer glitch
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
i am now on audio by phone just to
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
update you
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
and a question if i may uh
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
how would you prefer members when they
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
leave their seat for a moment or two
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
while we're on
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
i suggest that if you need to leave your
 
01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.270 align:start position:0%
i suggest that if you need to leave your
seat

01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
seat
 
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
you just click in the lower left hand uh
 
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
corner of your screen the stop video
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
button i'll show you what happens when
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
and then you can leave and when you come
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
back just
 
01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
click the button again and your video
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
will resume
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative mcwilliams you're
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
you're the last question before we move
 
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you chair bose just want to
 
01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.190 align:start position:0%
thank you chair bose just want to
clarify

01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
can you tell me the time limits again
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
that you have determined for
 
01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
any of the pieces of the hearing i just
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
want to write it down
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh sure i'm going to send these
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines out to everybody but
 
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
basically prime sponsors will get five
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
minutes other speakers will be limited
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
to three minutes
 
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh and uh committee members will be
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
limited to two questions for a presenter
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you well thanks very much for
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
all your questions this has been a
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
a good discussion as we always have uh
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
in in this committee i had intended
 
01:04:33.039 --> 01:04:34.309 align:start position:0%
in in this committee i had intended
originally

01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
originally
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
to go around to every member and has
 
01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
asked them to introduce themselves
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
but we got so deeply into the weeds with
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
questions that we have run out of time
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
maybe we will do that next friday for
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
those in attendance
 
01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
at the orientation meeting next week
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
but at this point in time i feel
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
obligated to
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
turn the floor over to the office of the
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
represented by the consumer advocate
 
01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:02.789 align:start position:0%
represented by the consumer advocate
himself

01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
himself
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
donald crease and he will
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
how electricity rates are
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
set developed and set uh by the public
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
utilities commission i believe that's
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%

uh let me just uh first of all say on
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
the first slide there's my friend ready
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
kilowatt i'm violating somebody's
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
trademark by showing him to you
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh i will send this uh uh little slide
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
deck out to everybody
 
01:06:20.549 --> 01:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
and you see on the first slide is my
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
name and contact information
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
that's my direct line down there on the
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
bottom and that email address gets right
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
to me and i
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
always like to talk to uh legislators
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
about matters of
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
public policy that i know something
 
01:06:35.039 --> 01:06:35.829 align:start position:0%
public policy that i know something
about

01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
so i want to start
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
with some basic principles
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
public utilities are under new hampshire
 
01:06:45.839 --> 01:06:46.150 align:start position:0%
public utilities are under new hampshire
law

01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
are regulated monopolies meaning that in
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
your uh wherever you are there's only
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
going to be one electric company
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
one gas utility one water company and in
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
a few places around the state there's
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
actually a sewer utility so
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
if you let a monopoly charge uh prices
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
without any government interference
 
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
then obviously the monopolist can
 
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
extract what are called monopoly rents
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
just sort of
 
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
charge an unreasonably high price
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
so the rate regulation is as conducted
 
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
by the public utilities commission
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
is intended to mimic what the
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
competitive market
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
would set as the price under principles
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
of classic microeconomics
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
if there were actually a competitive
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
market by statute the puc is
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
defined as the arbiter between the
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
interests of the owners and the
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
shareholders of the regulated
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
or the excuse me the customers and the
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
shareholders of their regulated
 
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.510 align:start position:0%
shareholders of their regulated
utilities

01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh utilities as you as you might imagine
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
are very well represented by the puc
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
they have lots of very talented lawyers
 
01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.430 align:start position:0%
they have lots of very talented lawyers
who

01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
advocate on their behalf and a lot of
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
very knowledgeable
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
experts and so as in about 45 states
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
around the country
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
the general court here in new hampshire
 
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
has established a ratepayer advocate
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
and that is me our job is to represent
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
the interests of residential customers
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
at the puc and frankly anywhere else
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
where the interests of residential
 
01:08:14.319 --> 01:08:15.510 align:start position:0%
where the interests of residential
customers

01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
customers
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
are implicated so the
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
idea is that we actually help the puc do
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
its job
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
by putting some weight on the other side
 
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
of its
 
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
arbiter scale so the utilities are
 
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
vigorously represented and hopefully
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
residential customers are also
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
vigorously represented
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
unlike a lot of my counterparts around
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
the country i do not represent
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
the interests of all customers i think
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
when our office was created the idea was
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
that commercial and industrial customers
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
would by virtue of their
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
economic niche i guess have their own
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
representation whereas residential
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
customers would
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
would not and i also want to stress that
 
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:57.759 align:start position:0%
i represent resident
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
residential customers as a group i do
 
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
not represent
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
individual residential customers i hear
 
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
from them from time to time and i try to
 
01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
help them
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
but i can't represent them at the puc or
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere else
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
so the bulwark of what the puc does as i
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
just suggested
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
is regulate the rates of public
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
utilities and of course rates are just
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
the prices that those public utilities
 
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
charge and by statute what the puc is
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to do
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
is make sure that rates are just and
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
reasonable that's a deliberately
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
vague statutory phrase there is also
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
on top of that a constitutional
 
01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.349 align:start position:0%
on top of that a constitutional
limitation

01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
limitation
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
that is grounded in the uh actually it's
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
the fifth amendment
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
and the language in the fifth amendment
 
01:09:47.829 --> 01:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
that says you cannot take private
 
01:09:47.839 --> 01:09:48.630 align:start position:0%
that says you cannot take private
property

01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
without just compensation the you being
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
the governor government
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
so the constitutional theory here is
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
that it is possible for a
 
01:09:59.350 --> 01:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
regulator to set rates that are so low
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
that they are
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
considered quote unquote confiscatory in
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
other words what you have done
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
in that scenario is in effect taken the
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
utilities property
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
and uh not provided just compensation
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
in the form of reasonable rates so
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
what does all of that mean well in 1944
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
the u.s supreme court issued its famous
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
hope natural gas decision
 
01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
and declared that rates are not
 
01:10:26.199 --> 01:10:27.669 align:start position:0%
and declared that rates are not
confiscatory

01:10:27.669 --> 01:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
confiscatory
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
when a return to the equity owner
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
meaning the shareholders
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
are commensurate with the return that
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
shareholders would earn on
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
other investments that have the same
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
degree of
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
risk associated with them it turns out
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
the reasonableness of return on
 
01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:44.149 align:start position:0%
the reasonableness of return on
investment

01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
is a function of risk as you all
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
intuitively know because
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
if you take a hundred dollars and invest
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
it uh deposit it at your local bank or
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
credit union
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to earn an extremely low
 
01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
rate of interest
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
if you take that same 100 and invest it
 
01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:00.390 align:start position:0%
if you take that same 100 and invest it
in

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
some high-flying stock on the nasdaq you
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
are going to expect
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
a higher rate of return because the risk
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
that you will lose your investment
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
is several orders of magnitude higher
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
and then uh there is my favorite case
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
which is a 1988 decision of the new
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
written by david suter back when he was
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
a member of that court
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
in which he pointed out that even though
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
rates can't be uh confiscatory
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
shareholders of utilities are not
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
entitled to what he called
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
plenary indemnification and then he
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
explained what he meant
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh this was a case in which the owner
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
the then owner of
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
the seabrook nuclear power plant which
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
at the time was public service company
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh tried to raise its authorized return
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
on equity
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
up to 19 and the puc said no you only
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
get 13
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
which is already pretty high and uh
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
public service company lost and justice
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
suiter explained
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
that if we just basically as your
 
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
investment in seabrook gets riskier and
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
riskier and riskier
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
if we just kept right raising the return
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
on equity that we allow you
 
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
the consequence of that would be as he
 
01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
said nothing less than a shifting of the
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
entire risk
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
from investors to the ratepayers and
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
neither the constitution
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
nor the statutory requirement of just
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
reasonable rates
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
justifies that so how does the public
 
01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
utilities commission
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
figure out whether rates are just and
 
01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:30.229 align:start position:0%
figure out whether rates are just and
reasonable

01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
well it turns out that because the
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
statutory standard is quite
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
vague and because the constitution
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't require it
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
there is no mandated way of setting
 
01:12:40.719 --> 01:12:41.270 align:start position:0%
there is no mandated way of setting
rates

01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
but over the years largely through
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
i guess what i would call case law both
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire and
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
everywhere else around the country the
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
established method is called
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
cost of service rate setting and
 
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
it works in a pretty straightforward
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
fashion uh the key determination
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
in a rate case at the puc is the
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
utilities avenue annual revenue
 
01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.830 align:start position:0%
utilities avenue annual revenue
requirement

01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's just how much money does the
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
utility need over the course of a
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
12-month period
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
in order to uh operate and the way you
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
figure out what the revenue requirement
 
01:13:15.199 --> 01:13:15.590 align:start position:0%
figure out what the revenue requirement
is

01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
is you determine what the operating
 
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
costs of the company are
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
you know what how much its payroll costs
 
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh how much gasoline it needs to buy in
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
order to fuel its
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
trucks and you know every other little
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
operating big or little
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
operating cost of the company and to
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
that number
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
you add a multiple of two other numbers
 
01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
one of which is the utilities rate base
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
other of which is the utilities weighted
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
average cost of capital
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
so what do we mean by rate base well
 
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
basically rate base
 
01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
is the value of the utilities
 
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh capital investments the actual
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
hardware that it uses to provide service
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
and how do we determine rate base it's
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
the original cost incurred by the
 
01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:02.630 align:start position:0%
the original cost incurred by the
utility

01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
utility
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
to build that infrastructure uh minus
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
a uh because everything
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
depreciates over time you calculate the
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
depreciation every year
 
01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
so that an asset that was built in 1950
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
is probably fully depreciated by now so
 
01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:20.390 align:start position:0%
is probably fully depreciated by now so
its

01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
its
 
01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh rate base is probably something close
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
to zero
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh whereas if a utility puts in say a
 
01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:27.270 align:start position:0%
uh whereas if a utility puts in say a
huge

01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
huge
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
transformer at a substation this week
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
its original cost is going to be in the
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
tens of millions of dollars and that's
 
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
the number that goes into rate base
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
and it declines over time as the asset
 
01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.270 align:start position:0%
and it declines over time as the asset
depreciates

01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
depreciates
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
and then the other number in the formula
 
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
is the weighted average cost of capital
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
that is a function of the utility's cost
 
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
of debt
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
and the utilities cost of equity and as
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
i'm guessing most of you know or
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
what i generally like to say is that
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
they're really just two flavors of money
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
there's your money and there's other
 
01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
people's money so
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
in the case of a utility the your money
 
01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:05.830 align:start position:0%
in the case of a utility the your money
is

01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
the shareholder investment that's equity
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
other people's money is debt which is
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
money that you borrow from
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
other people usually banks and other
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
lending institutions
 
01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
so uh the interest that you have to pay
 
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
out on your debt
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
is going to be lower than the return
 
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
that your shareholders
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
are expecting on their equity and you
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
calculate what a reasonable return on
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
equity is
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
you plug in the utilities cost of debt
 
01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
you weight them depending on
 
01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the utility is funded
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
by debt and equity and there you come
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
out with the weighted average cost of
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
capital which is basically
 
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
the return on the utility's total
 
01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.110 align:start position:0%
the return on the utility's total
investment

01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
you multiply that return by the rate
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
case you add that to the operating costs
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
and you come out with the revenue
 
01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.110 align:start position:0%
and you come out with the revenue
requirement

01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
but the revenue requirement
 
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
determination is
 
01:15:57.750 --> 01:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
just the first act of what is really a
 
01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:58.870 align:start position:0%
just the first act of what is really a
two-act

01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
two-act
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
play because you have to take that
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
revenue requirement and apportion it
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
among the various rate classes what do i
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
mean by rate classes well
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
i'm a residential customer uh the
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh dartmouth-hitchcock medical center in
 
01:16:15.199 --> 01:16:15.750 align:start position:0%
uh dartmouth-hitchcock medical center in
lebanon

01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
lebanon
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
is a big commercial and industrial
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
customer uh
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
the budweiser plant down in
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
nashua they're a commercial industrial
 
01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.990 align:start position:0%
nashua they're a commercial industrial
customer

01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
customer
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
your business your dentist's office is a
 
01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:29.590 align:start position:0%
your business your dentist's office is a
small

01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
small
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
commercial customer and so each
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
utility divides its customers up into
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
various classes
 
01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
and the revenue requirement likewise has
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
to be divided up amongst those various
 
01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:41.430 align:start position:0%
to be divided up amongst those various
classes

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
classes
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
how do we do that well basically the uh
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
idea is that each rate class is supposed
 
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
to bear
 
01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
its reasonable share of what it actually
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
costs to operate the utility
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
so the utility does what are called cost
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
of service studies to try to figure that
 
01:16:58.320 --> 01:16:59.030 align:start position:0%
of service studies to try to figure that
out

01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh other problems and issues
 
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
that drive rate design are to what
 
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
extent a utilities revenue requirement
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
should come via fixed charges
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
versus variable charges by fixed charges
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
when you look on your electric bill
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
there's a fixed customer charge of uh
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
you know 13 i think it is in the
 
01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
eversource territory for
 
01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
residential customers and you get that
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
13 charge every month no matter how much
 
01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
electricity you use
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
and then there are also variable charges
 
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
and by that i mean they vary depending
 
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
on how many kilowatt hours of
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
electricity you use
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
so what part of the cost do you put in
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
the variable charges
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
what party of the cost do you put in the
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
fixed charges
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
ideally you put the utilities fixed
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
costs in the fixed charges
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
and you put the utilities variable
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
charges in the variable charges
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
that's easy to talk about in principle
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
very hard to do without a lot of
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
argument and hand-wringing
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
in reality there are also social equity
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
principles that come to bear
 
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
on uh rate design we don't charge
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
everybody the same rates even if they're
 
01:18:05.679 --> 01:18:06.550 align:start position:0%
everybody the same rates even if they're
basically

01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
imposing the same costs on the system
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
the classic example is that there are
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
often special rates and programs
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
available to
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh income eligible customers people who
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
have trouble paying their
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
utility bills and then um when you look
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
at rate when you think about how to
 
01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:22.870 align:start position:0%
at rate when you think about how to
design

01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
design
 
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
rates you also have to consider the
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
question of price signals
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
you know what are we what are we
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to do
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
or discouraging people from doing based
 
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
on the kind
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
of rates that we're charging them and uh
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
the example of that that we're talking
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
about a lot these days
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
have to do with rates that vary by time
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
of day and by season
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
it's much more expensive to produce a
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour of electricity
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
on the hottest day in july at about 5
 
01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:52.870 align:start position:0%
on the hottest day in july at about 5
p.m

01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
p.m
 
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
than it is on a random april
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
saturday night at two in the morning
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
when the cost is
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
pretty close to zero so do we set our
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
retail rates to reflect those costs
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
ideally or theoretically the answer to
 
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
that question is yes because we want to
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
encourage consumption when the resource
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
is plantable plentiful
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
and we want to discourage consumption
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
when it
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
the the other important question that
 
01:19:23.679 --> 01:19:24.310 align:start position:0%
the the other important question that
bears

01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
bears
 
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
upon all of this business of utility
 
01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:27.669 align:start position:0%
upon all of this business of utility
regulation

01:19:27.669 --> 01:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
is what what is the state going to be
 
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
able to do
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
and what is the federal government going
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
to be able to do
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
and that question is centered around the
 
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
commerce clause of the
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
u.s constitution which gives congress
 
01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
the right to regulate
 
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce so the federal
 
01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
government does not have the right to
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
regulate intrastate commerce
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
just interstate commerce and then
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
the other part of the constitution
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's relevant is the
 
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
supremacy clause that says that federal
 
01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:01.030 align:start position:0%
supremacy clause that says that federal
law

01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
is the supreme law of the land so as
 
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
long as congress
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
is acting within its authority to
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
regulate interstate commerce
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
when it does act that is the supreme law
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the land
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
and to the extent state law is
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the federal law
 
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
that is what's known as preemption
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
and it means that the state law is void
 
01:20:22.709 --> 01:20:22.719 align:start position:0%
and the federal law
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
governs so what do we mean by federal
 
01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:25.910 align:start position:0%
governs so what do we mean by federal
law

01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
well in the electricity realm we're
 
01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
principally talking about the federal
 
01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:30.149 align:start position:0%
principally talking about the federal
power

01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
power
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
act and you know again it's a very
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
complicated scenario but the basic
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
principles are pretty easy to state
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh the federal energy regulatory
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
commission regulates
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
wholesale electricity and interstate
 
01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:43.830 align:start position:0%
wholesale electricity and interstate
transmission

01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of the vocabulary that we
 
01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
use in this space
 
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
is complicated and convoluted and hard
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
but one term that is not hard to
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
understand is what
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
wholesale is it means exactly what the
 
01:20:59.910 --> 01:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
word means in common parlance something
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
is wholesale
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
if it is sold for resale
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
and it is retail if it is sold to the
 
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
end user
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's just that straightforward with
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
electricity the ferc regulates
 
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
wholesale electricity in interstate
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
commerce it also regulates
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
interstate transmission of electricity
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
meaning electricity that moves across
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
state lines
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
mostly via the high voltage bulk power
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
transmission system so what does that
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
leave for the states to do well it
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
leaves a lot for the states to do
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
states regulate retail electricity it
 
01:21:34.629 --> 01:21:34.639 align:start position:0%
regulates what
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
generation choices get made within a
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
state so it is up to the state of new
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire to decide
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh whether it's okay to build a new
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
natural gas power plant somewhere
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
or a new uh uh wind project or how much
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh rooftop solar to put on people's
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
roofs or
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
anything that has to do with what
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
generation and how much of it to site
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
and then it is also the state's job to
 
01:21:58.639 --> 01:21:59.430 align:start position:0%
and then it is also the state's job to
assure

01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
assure
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
so-called resource adequacy in other
 
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:02.629 align:start position:0%
so-called resource adequacy in other
words

01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
words
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
is there enough generation to make sure
 
01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:06.639 align:start position:0%
that all of our
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
needs are being met that's fundamentally
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
a state responsibility
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
and on the natural gas side there is a
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
federal statute called the natural gas
 
01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:15.270 align:start position:0%
federal statute called the natural gas
act

01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
act
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
and while it does have some differences
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
from the federal power act
 
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
at the macro 10 000 foot level that i'm
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
talking about today
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
it's pretty similar to the federal power
 
01:22:24.719 --> 01:22:26.390 align:start position:0%
it's pretty similar to the federal power
act

01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
act
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
okay i want to give you the history of
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire electricity
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
in one slide i'm really proud of my
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
ability to do this especially given this
 
01:22:35.199 --> 01:22:36.310 align:start position:0%
ability to do this especially given this
year's

01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
year's
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
emphasis on concision uh the key figure
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
in the history of electricity in the
 
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
united states
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
is samuel insel who lived from 1859 to
 
01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.149 align:start position:0%
is samuel insel who lived from 1859 to
1938.

01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
1938.
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh he became uh well he became the
 
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
private secretary to thomas
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
edison in 1881 that's how he got his
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
foot in the door
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
he moved to chicago eventually and
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
became president of chicago edison in
 
01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:01.750 align:start position:0%
became president of chicago edison in
1892

01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
1892
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
and he used his perch from the
 
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
presidency of chicago edison to build a
 
01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.830 align:start position:0%
presidency of chicago edison to build a
ginormous

01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
ginormous
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh electric utility empire that
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
basically stretched across the whole
 
01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:12.390 align:start position:0%
basically stretched across the whole
country

01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
and gave him control of essentially
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
every public utility with the words
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
public service in the name so yes
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
i am talking about public service
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
company of new hampshire
 
01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
in 1892 thomas insult went before
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
the national electric light association
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
which was
 
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
the um trade association of electric
 
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
utilities at the time
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
and he said look we want to be regulated
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea because it will give us
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
protection and it will basically
 
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
guarantee us
 
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
return on investment we won't have to go
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
from municipality to municipality and
 
01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:44.470 align:start position:0%
from municipality to municipality and
bribe

01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
bribe
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
municipal officials anymore we can just
 
01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
get states to regulate us
 
01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
at the state level it's a good deal he
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
convinced everybody
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
and so essentially every state in the
 
01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:55.350 align:start position:0%
and so essentially every state in the
country

01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
beginning at around 1910 created a
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
public utility commission
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
to regulate electric utilities and again
 
01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
the industry
 
01:24:05.669 --> 01:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
asked for it that's very important to
 
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
the history of electricity
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh eventually insult controlled an
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
empire of 500 million dollars
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
he'd only invested 27 million to get
 
01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.350 align:start position:0%
he'd only invested 27 million to get
that

but the great depression came his empire
 
01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:18.629 align:start position:0%
but the great depression came his empire
collapsed

01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
collapsed
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
it wiped out the savings of 600 million
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh 600
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
000 shareholders and congress passed the
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
public utility holding company act in
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
1935 to break up these utility empires
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
meanwhile insulin fled to fl uh france
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
and uh for trivia buffs he died in the
 
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
place de la concord metro station in
 
01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:38.950 align:start position:0%

1938

01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:38.960 align:start position:0%

01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
and when his body was discovered his
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
wallet was missing
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
so samuel insell the very first
 
01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.550 align:start position:0%
so samuel insell the very first
important

01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh historical figure in the electric
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
industry as i said in
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
the 1930s congress passed the public
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
utility holding company act to bust up
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
these big utility empires
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
also the rural electrification act which
 
01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
created rural electric co-ops like the
 
01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire electric co-op here
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
and basically things sort of clunked
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
along very nicely in the electric
 
01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:07.669 align:start position:0%
along very nicely in the electric
industry

01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
industry
 
01:25:11.110 --> 01:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
as costs declined over time until the
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
arab oil embargo in 1978 which upended
 
01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:15.270 align:start position:0%
arab oil embargo in 1978 which upended
the

01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
industry and as a result of that in 1978
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh president carter signed the public
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
utility regulatory policies act
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
into law and it turns out that our
 
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
senator john durkin was a key player in
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
the development of purpa
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
and purpa was the very first nose uh
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh under the tent of non-utility
 
01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:36.950 align:start position:0%
uh under the tent of non-utility
generation

01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
generation
 
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
and uh senator john durkin played a role
 
01:25:39.679 --> 01:25:39.990 align:start position:0%
and uh senator john durkin played a role
in

01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
getting the provisions into place to do
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
that and as a result new hampshire
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
more than i think most other states
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
developed a very robust and vibrant
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
network of non-utility generators most
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
of which
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
used a low-grade wood to produce their
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
electricity by burning it
 
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
so now we have non-utility generators
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
beginning to proliferate
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
in 1988 we had what i call the big bang
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
which is to say
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
that after oh gosh 15 years
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
of investing money and building the
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
seabrook power plant
 
01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
without being able to bring it online it
 
01:26:17.110 --> 01:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
finally forced public service company
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
into bankruptcy in part because of
 
01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:20.870 align:start position:0%
into bankruptcy in part because of
decisions

01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
like the one that david suter made that
 
01:26:25.110 --> 01:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
i told you about earlier
 
01:26:26.709 --> 01:26:26.719 align:start position:0%
a public service company goes into
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy utility bankruptcies are bad
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
for customers
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
and uh electric rates in the psnh
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
service tour
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
service territory went way up because
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
psnh was bought out of bankruptcy
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh by a company called northeast
 
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
utilities in 1992
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
congress passed the energy policy act
 
01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:48.870 align:start position:0%
congress passed the energy policy act
which

01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
encouraged even more development of
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
non-utility generate
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
generation uh iso new england was formed
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
iso new england
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
is a non-profit organization it's known
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
generically as a regional transmission
 
01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.310 align:start position:0%
generically as a regional transmission
organization

01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
it operates the electricity grid for all
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
of new england
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
and it also operates the markets through
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
which wholesale electricity is
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
bought and sold so it's a very important
 
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
organization and
 
01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
note that some of what it does is
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh it assures the existence of resource
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
adequacy around the region now remember
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
state responsibility it has largely been
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
ceded to iso new england
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
this is very controversial because iso
 
01:27:35.110 --> 01:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
new england is really regulated at the
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
and states when it comes to iso new
 
01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:39.990 align:start position:0%
and states when it comes to iso new
england

01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
england
 
01:27:42.270 --> 01:27:42.280 align:start position:0%
are i think kind of limited to
 
01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:43.430 align:start position:0%
are i think kind of limited to
persuasion

01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
persuasion
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
and query whether that is adequate
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
but anyway the energy policy act had the
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
effect of opening up
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh generation to competition at the
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
wholesale level
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
and down at the retail level uh new
 
01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:57.350 align:start position:0%
and down at the retail level uh new
hampshire

01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
was one of the very earliest adopters of
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
trying to create competition and
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
electricity at the retail level
 
01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
by passing the electric utility
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
restructuring act in 1996.
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
another bit of trivia the 1996
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
restructuring act was largely the work
 
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
of two
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
very well-known legislators one of whom
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
is still in the legislature
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
jeb bradley he was a house member at the
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
time and of course now he's the senate
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
majority leader
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
but he really is the godfather of
 
01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
restructuring in new hampshire along
 
01:28:27.679 --> 01:28:28.550 align:start position:0%
restructuring in new hampshire along
with

01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
clifton below who was again in the on
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
this very committee
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
st e back in 1996 eventually he went on
 
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
to the state senate
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
after that he became a public utility
 
01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:40.629 align:start position:0%
after that he became a public utility
commission

01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner and now he is the assistant
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
mayor in lebanon and so lebanon is
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
has a very active and vibrant energy
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
policy agenda
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
and i will bet you lunch that you will
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
be hearing testimony
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
from deputy mayor below over the course
 
01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
of this session
 
01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
for my money the next big event was the
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
decision by public service company of
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the last throws of its owning
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
generation assets
 
01:29:10.629 --> 01:29:10.639 align:start position:0%
to waste 400 million dollars on a
 
01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
mercury scrubber
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
at merrimack station uh the
 
01:29:17.110 --> 01:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
customers of public service company of
 
01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire are
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
paying 400 million of the 425 million
 
01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
that psnh invested in that scrubber
 
01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
even though the snh no longer owns its
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh generation portfolio and it was just
 
01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
a regrettable turn of events that i'd be
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
happy to talk about at great length
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
anytime anybody wants to hear about it
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
and then more recently you have three uh
 
01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
failed projects here in new england
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
one was the northern pass transmission
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
line that was going to slice through the
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
middle of new hampshire
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
and bring uh hydroelectric power down
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
from canada
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
and uh sell it to customers in
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
massachusetts because that state has
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
mandated the acquisition of that kind of
 
01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:58.390 align:start position:0%
mandated the acquisition of that kind of
energy

01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
and then there were two pipeline natural
 
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
gas pipeline projects
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
the ned project that's northeast direct
 
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
and access northeast
 
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
they were supposed to bring more natural
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
gas into new england and since we're
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
very reliant on natural gas generation
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
in new england
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
that was going to be helpful to the
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
natural gas plants but
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
both of those projects were cancelled
 
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
meanwhile there is the so-called missing
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
money problem
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
it turns out that when you cap the
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh wholesale price of electricity the
 
01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
way we do here in new england
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for generators at
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
the margin that are idle most of the
 
01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.189 align:start position:0%
the margin that are idle most of the
year

01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
to make enough money to operate without
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
losing money requires some additional
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
revenue stream and so
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
now we have a wholesale capacity market
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
in new england
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh it means that generators are
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
basically just paid to be available to
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
generate and there are all kinds of
 
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
fights perpetually brewing
 
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
about how the rules for the forward
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
capacity market
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
should be set and that causes quite a
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
bit of unrest in the world of iso new
 
01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:10.149 align:start position:0%
bit of unrest in the world of iso new
england

01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
england
 
01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure you'll be hearing more
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
this is a series of unfortunate events
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
that occurred in 2015
 
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh through 2018 and in the interest of
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
time i'm not going to go through this
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
except to say that in 2018 the new
 
01:31:28.229 --> 01:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court made a very
 
01:31:28.239 --> 01:31:29.110 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court made a very
regrettable

01:31:29.110 --> 01:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
regrettable
 
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
ruling to the effect that the purpose of
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
the restructuring act
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
was to reduce electricity costs to
 
01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:36.470 align:start position:0%
was to reduce electricity costs to
consumers

01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
when in fact i think justice hicks in
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
his dissenting opinion
 
01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
actually had the right answer which is
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
yes the legislature is always trying to
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
reduce electricity costs as much as
 
01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:47.350 align:start position:0%
reduce electricity costs as much as
possible

01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
but the idea of the restructuring act
 
01:31:51.189 --> 01:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
was to pick a different means of getting
 
01:31:51.199 --> 01:31:51.669 align:start position:0%
was to pick a different means of getting
there

01:31:51.669 --> 01:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
and that means was competition so
 
01:31:57.110 --> 01:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
i think the purpose of the restructuring
 
01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
act was to transfer the
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
risk of generation investments going bad
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
away from consumers and onto the backs
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
of investors where they belong
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately the new hampshire
 
01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
disagreed and the issue became moot
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
because the access
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
northeast pipeline was canceled and
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
therefore we didn't have to have a big
 
01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
fight over whether it made sense to put
 
01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
the costs of a
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
natural gas pipeline into electric
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
distribution rates i
 
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
i to me it just didn't make any sense uh
 
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
i just want to explain briefly who the
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
office of the consumer advocate actually
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
is uh we're a group of five people there
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
is me i'm an attorney the statute says i
 
01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:40.719 align:start position:0%
have to be an attorney
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
i used to be the general counsel of the
 
01:32:42.719 --> 01:32:43.750 align:start position:0%
i used to be the general counsel of the
puc

01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
puc
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh my deputy pradeep chadopodtai
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
is a phd economist and a very key member
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
of our staff
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
we just lost our director of finance so
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
we're hiring a new one and if you know
 
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
anybody who would like to be
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
the director of finance at the office of
 
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
the consumer advocate i hope you will
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
put that person in touch with me because
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
i'd love to talk to them
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
for the last year and a half our staff
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
attorney has been krista
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
shoot who we lured over here from
 
01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:12.470 align:start position:0%
shoot who we lured over here from
vermont

01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
she has a lot of experience
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
in the business sector which is very
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
helpful to us
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
because i lack that kind of experience
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
and then of course
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
the person who keeps everybody uh who
 
01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
keeps everything running is our legal
 
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
assistant jamie breen
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
and uh you should if you call our office
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
you'll get her and she will help you
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
on top of me there's a thing called the
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers advisory board
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
it's a nine member board and its
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
principal duty is acting as a sort of a
 
01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:42.790 align:start position:0%
principal duty is acting as a sort of a
gatekeeper

01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
gatekeeper
 
01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
when it's time to decide who actually is
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
going to be the consumer advocate
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
my current term expires in late 2023
 
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
so during 2023 the residential
 
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
ratepayers advisory board will have to
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
do a lot of work
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
in deciding who the consumer advocate is
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
going to be and i'd be happy to talk
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
about the process for doing that at some
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
suitable point
 
01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
i also always like to tell people who we
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
aren't we have nothing to do
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
with the site evaluation committee the
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
is the state body that decides uh
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
whether to allow the construction of
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
major energy facilities
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
there is a person
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
at this who appears before the site
 
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee called the council
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
for the public
 
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
he or she is supposed to represent the
 
01:34:28.159 --> 01:34:29.590 align:start position:0%
he or she is supposed to represent the
public

01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:34:32.709 --> 01:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
that is her statutory duty there on the
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
screen it's different from
 
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
ours uh and uh
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
the main point i want to make is that i
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
don't do that i do not
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee is
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
kryptonite to me as consumer advocate i
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
don't go there
 
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's also important for the committee to
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
understand that back in 2012
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh the general court essentially
 
01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:54.229 align:start position:0%
uh the general court essentially
deregulated

01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
deregulated
 
01:34:57.669 --> 01:34:57.679 align:start position:0%
a local telephone service so we have
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
very little to say anymore about what
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
your local exchange carrier does
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
or doesn't do and the theory i think
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
back then
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
is that competition in the telecom
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
industry has become sufficiently robust
 
01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
that it's no longer a natural monopoly
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
we also don't regulate broadband
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
because the federal government through
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
the federal communications act has
 
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
preempted all regulation of broadband
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
so again outside my authority really
 
01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
what do i perceive to be the hot
 
01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:28.149 align:start position:0%
what do i perceive to be the hot
legislative

01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
topics for 2021. well i've i've gone
 
01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:32.390 align:start position:0%
topics for 2021. well i've i've gone
through

01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:35:35.189 --> 01:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
the bills that you have all uh
 
01:35:35.199 --> 01:35:35.990 align:start position:0%
the bills that you have all uh
introduced

01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
and for me the big issue is what to do
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
about the energy efficiency
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
resource standard as consumer advocate i
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
am firmly convinced that the cheapest
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
way of meeting the next
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
unit of demand for electricity and
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
natural gas
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
is through what i call megawatts instead
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
of megawatts
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
but how to do that and what constraints
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
to put on
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
our utilities doing that well that's the
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
subject of those
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
bill numbers that you see before them
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
and they're among the
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
whatever is 32 bills that you all have
 
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
to work on over the next
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
six weeks another big issue for us is
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
community power
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
aggregation i think restructuring
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
has been largely a bust for residential
 
01:36:23.189 --> 01:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
customers in the sense that residential
 
01:36:23.199 --> 01:36:24.149 align:start position:0%
customers in the sense that residential
customers

01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
customers
 
01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
have paid hundreds of millions of
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
dollars of stranded costs
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
that was a process made necessary by the
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
process of backing utilities
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
out of being vertically integrated
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
generation owning utilities
 
01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's been very good for commercial and
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
industrial customers they've been able
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
to save a lot of money
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
on retail electricity i don't think
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
residential customers
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
have saved very much money at all by
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
migrating into the world of competitive
 
01:36:50.639 --> 01:36:51.669 align:start position:0%
migrating into the world of competitive
generators

01:36:51.669 --> 01:36:51.679 align:start position:0%
generators
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
but i think allowing municipalities to
 
01:36:54.719 --> 01:36:56.390 align:start position:0%
but i think allowing municipalities to
become

01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
become
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
to basically become the demand
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
aggregator for their customers and their
 
01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:02.709 align:start position:0%
aggregator for their customers and their
borders

01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
borders
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
that that has a lot of potential for
 
01:37:07.109 --> 01:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
taking that retail buying power
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
and uh deploying it in a way that will
 
01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
bring rate relief real rate relief
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
to residential customers but again
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
there's a some disputes over
 
01:37:18.149 --> 01:37:18.159 align:start position:0%
what rules ought to govern how to do
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
that and that is the subject
 
01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
of hb 315 and i most certainly will come
 
01:37:22.719 --> 01:37:23.350 align:start position:0%
of hb 315 and i most certainly will come
and

01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
testify on the day that that bill comes
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
up for hearing
 
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh there the question of greenhouse gas
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
reduction goals is pending in front of
 
01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:32.149 align:start position:0%
reduction goals is pending in front of
you

01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
that's a subject i probably won't
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
testify about uh
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
environmental policy is not really
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
within my
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
bailiwick as the state's ratepayer
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
advocate and so it's up to you
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
as the general court to decide whether
 
01:37:47.590 --> 01:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
we want to
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
make it official state policy to reduce
 
01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
and if so how we're going to make that
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
happen in our energy sectors and what
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
that will do to electric rates and
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
natural gas rates
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
a perennial issue is net metering and
 
01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
you see that there are
 
01:38:06.629 --> 01:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
that subject and there is also house
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
bill 371 which uh
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative harrington actually
 
01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
introduced at my suggestion
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
it clarifies that rate cases which is
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
what i was just talking about and any
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
proceedings that have to do with rates
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
are subject to the administrative
 
01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
procedure act meaning the commission has
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
to hold formal hearings
 
01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
take evidence make decisions based on a
 
01:38:30.239 --> 01:38:31.030 align:start position:0%
take evidence make decisions based on a
record

01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
record
 
01:38:33.189 --> 01:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
rather than treat them as so-called
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
legislative dockets the the commission
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
put out an
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
order late last year saying oh you know
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
we think rate proceedings are
 
01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
legislative dockets i'm here to say as a
 
01:38:43.119 --> 01:38:44.629 align:start position:0%
legislative dockets i'm here to say as a
lawyer

01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
there is no such thing as a legislative
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
docket unless you're talking about
 
01:38:48.239 --> 01:38:49.270 align:start position:0%
docket unless you're talking about
rulemaking

01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
rulemaking
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
and hb 371 will give you an opportunity
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
to clarify that
 
01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
and again i'll be here to testify uh our
 
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
priorities as an
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
office for 2021 well grid modernization
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
is a perennial issue the puc has had a
 
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
grid modernization
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh investigation open since 2015
 
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
so that docket is now in first grade
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
and the commission put out a really
 
01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
excellent grid modernization order
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
last spring which i would warmly
 
01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
recommend that each of you read
 
01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
it was very pro-consumer so of course
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
the utilities hated it
 
01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
and they filed a re-hearing motion and
 
01:39:30.669 --> 01:39:30.679 align:start position:0%
the commission suspended the
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the order
 
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
and we are still awaiting the
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
commission's decision on the rehearing
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
motion it's a very big issue because
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
modernizing the grid
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
is very important the question of how
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
aggressive to be about deploying
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
advanced metering
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
in the electric sector is very important
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
to us
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
advanced metering allows for a lot of
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
data to be gathered about
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
electric usage on a very granular level
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
that enables consumers to do all kinds
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
of cool things like
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
have the kind of time of use rates that
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
i was just talking about
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
obviously if your meter isn't recording
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
when you're using how much electricity
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
on you know a 15-minute basis then
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
there's no way of setting rates that
 
01:40:13.119 --> 01:40:13.910 align:start position:0%
there's no way of setting rates that
vary

01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
vary
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
with the um time of day or time of year
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
that you use them
 
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
since the early 1990s
 
01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
the concept of least cost integrated
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
resource planning has been
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
a feature of our utility law to some
 
01:40:30.719 --> 01:40:31.270 align:start position:0%
a feature of our utility law to some
degree

01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
degree
 
01:40:33.990 --> 01:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
it is a i guess i would call it a relic
 
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
of sorts of the
 
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
old vertically integrated era the idea
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
back then before we restructured
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
was that we don't want the puc
 
01:40:48.790 --> 01:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
simply to consider individual utility
 
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
investments on a piecemeal basis because
 
01:40:53.189 --> 01:40:53.199 align:start position:0%
it's very easy to justify them that way
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
the idea is that we want utilities to do
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
all of their planning
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
on a lease cost basis so that it
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
saves customers as much money as
 
01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:03.189 align:start position:0%
saves customers as much money as
possible

01:41:03.189 --> 01:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
while still accomplishing the public
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
policy objectives that we
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
entrust to public utilities and the
 
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
least cost integrated resource planning
 
01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:12.070 align:start position:0%
least cost integrated resource planning
process

01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
is the way that is supposed to happen
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
the puc hasn't been enforcing the least
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
cost integrated resource
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
planning statute however and i've now
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
torn out every last bit of hair i have
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
over that
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
and i think that we need to reform the
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
least cost integrated resource planning
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
process and possibly even the statute
 
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
i've already been talking about why i
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
love time of use rates
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
i mentioned that we need to reform iso
 
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
new england
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
and its so-called stakeholder advisory
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
board which is called kneepool
 
01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to say that the region's
 
01:41:45.679 --> 01:41:46.790 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to say that the region's
governors

01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
governors
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
acting through a body they call nesco
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
has likewise been calling for
 
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
major reforms at iso new england to make
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
it responsive
 
01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
transparent and accountable and i'm
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
looking forward to having
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
that discussion here and everywhere else
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
there are a pile of ray cases that we're
 
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
going to be dealing with this year
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
liberty utilities has a natural gas rate
 
01:42:09.669 --> 01:42:09.679 align:start position:0%
case that they have filed
 
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh unitil is going to file an electric
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
rate case sometime this spring and there
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
are a whole pile of water utility
 
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
rate cases pending and the three biggest
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
ones are listed there aquarian which was
 
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
recently bought by eversource
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh penichak east and that's a subsidiary
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
of the penichak corporation
 
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
in nashua which is a really a unique
 
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
public utility in that it is an
 
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
investor-owned utility
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
it only has one investor though and that
 
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
investor happens to be the city of
 
01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:42.870 align:start position:0%
investor happens to be the city of
nashua

01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
which is a very odd situation that we
 
01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
find very interesting
 
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
and then there's the uh hampstead area
 
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
water company
 
01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
in the southeastern part of the state
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
they have a rate case too
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
two years ago we persuaded the
 
01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:57.990 align:start position:0%
two years ago we persuaded the
legislature

01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
with the heroic help of my friend
 
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
to pass a statute calling for the
 
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
development of a statewide
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
energy customer data platform there is
 
01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:09.030 align:start position:0%
energy customer data platform there is
an

01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
open docket at the puc to figure out how
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
to do that and we are slowly but surely
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
making progress
 
01:43:19.350 --> 01:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
i think that the existence of an energy
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
customer data platform
 
01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be key to allowing customers
 
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
great things with their energy use and
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
again i'd be happy to talk about that in
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
all kinds of great detail and my last
 
01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:32.470 align:start position:0%
all kinds of great detail and my last
slide

01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
slide
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
is the most excellent building in all of
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
and one of the greatest buildings in the
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
united states and
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to tell you where it is
 
01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
you have to identify it
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
that is the entirety of my prepared
 
01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:47.990 align:start position:0%
that is the entirety of my prepared
remarks

01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
remarks
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
and mr chairman i'd be happy to answer
 
01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
questions or hang around or do anything
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
that you think would be helpful well
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
mr crease we we sincerely appreciate
 
01:43:59.679 --> 01:44:00.310 align:start position:0%
mr crease we we sincerely appreciate
that

01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
very informative uh presentation
 
01:44:06.149 --> 01:44:06.159 align:start position:0%
i do feel obligated to point out to the
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
members that
 
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
well mr crease is extremely
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about a lot of things
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
some of the information in his
 
01:44:15.119 --> 01:44:16.870 align:start position:0%
some of the information in his
presentation

01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:44:19.109 --> 01:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
has another another side to it another
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
component to it
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
and doesn't tell
 
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily the full story that's that's
 
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
quite so i i do want to say that i tried
 
01:44:30.629 --> 01:44:30.639 align:start position:0%
to be as neutral as i possibly could but
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
i did
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
inject in a couple of places some
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
editorial comments
 
01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
for sure and uh you're entitled to do
 
01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:39.270 align:start position:0%
for sure and uh you're entitled to do
that

01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
uh but we also are entitled to
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
point out when you do that thank you
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
all right so do we have any questions i
 
01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
see that we do have a couple so let's
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
start with
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for an excellent
 
01:44:59.430 --> 01:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
presentation that was wonderful thank
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
you for
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
um presenting all the background to get
 
01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
us where we're going
 
01:45:07.590 --> 01:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
um i i did just want to kind of
 
01:45:10.229 --> 01:45:10.239 align:start position:0%
do a quick follow up on what your
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
expectations are
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
regarding microgrids in specific for
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
residential if you could speak a little
 
01:45:18.629 --> 01:45:18.639 align:start position:0%
bit to that and i also wanted to say
 
01:45:20.310 --> 01:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the beautiful image of the
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
yale library
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh it's actually the phillips exeter
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
academy library
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
the library uh designed by louis khan
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
who is the greatest architect of the
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
20th century he also has a building down
 
01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
at yale
 
01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
uh and so anyway i love louis con
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
micro grids so uh you know
 
01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
i i think it depends a little bit on
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
what exactly
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
you mean by micro grids
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh public service company of new
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire made a
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
proposal to develop a micro grid in
 
01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:56.629 align:start position:0%
proposal to develop a micro grid in
portsmouth

01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
portsmouth
 
01:45:59.590 --> 01:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
and it kind of backed off of that and my
 
01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
impression is that they are
 
01:46:04.229 --> 01:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
still uh working on developing
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
that uh as i understand a micro grid it
 
01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
is a uh basically
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's something that can exist at the
 
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
neighborhood level that would allow
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
that neighborhood to in certain
 
01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:17.669 align:start position:0%
that neighborhood to in certain
circumstances

01:46:17.669 --> 01:46:17.679 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:46:19.590 --> 01:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
island itself from the rest of the
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
electric grid
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
and basically serve its own needs either
 
01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
some of the time or maybe even
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
all of the time and
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
right now we haven't really moved in
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
that direction in new hampshire and
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any current efforts
 
01:46:37.109 --> 01:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
before the puc
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
to nudge the state in that direction
 
01:46:43.750 --> 01:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's a really interesting question to uh
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
think about how reasonable it is
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
to allow certain discrete parts of the
 
01:46:53.590 --> 01:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
utility service territory to go out on
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
on its own
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh to some degree so i don't know i
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
think it's an open question right now
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh next questioner is
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
01:47:12.310 --> 01:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
just a question thank you don for the
 
01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:12.950 align:start position:0%
just a question thank you don for the
excellent

01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
presentation will this presentation and
 
01:47:17.669 --> 01:47:17.679 align:start position:0%
your slides be available to the
 
01:47:17.679 --> 01:47:18.950 align:start position:0%
your slides be available to the
committee

01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
and where will it be available
 
01:47:24.629 --> 01:47:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that question what i
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
would propose to do
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
with the chairman's permission is i will
 
01:47:28.639 --> 01:47:29.669 align:start position:0%
with the chairman's permission is i will
simply

01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:29.679 align:start position:0%
simply
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%

01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
each of you
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
and i think i think it will get to miss
 
01:47:37.590 --> 01:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
four that way too and then she can
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh keep it in the rec official records
 
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
thank you doc yes that would be
 
01:47:44.159 --> 01:47:45.270 align:start position:0%
thank you doc yes that would be
acceptable

acceptable
 
01:47:48.629 --> 01:47:48.639 align:start position:0%
thank you do we have any uh
 
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
further questions from members of the
 
01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:54.470 align:start position:0%
further questions from members of the
committee

01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
well i would just like to thank all of

you for the opportunity to kind of set
 
01:47:57.840 --> 01:47:59.109 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to kind of set
the

01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
stage and be the first exemplar i guess
 
01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
of the substantive law that you all are
 
01:48:06.550 --> 01:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
operating within and i
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
i'm very pleased to meet those of you
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
who i'm not previously acquainted with

and i hope you will all feel free to
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
contact me
 
01:48:15.669 --> 01:48:15.679 align:start position:0%
at the contact info on my first slide
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
because as i said i love to interact
 
01:48:19.590 --> 01:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
with legislators
 
01:48:23.109 --> 01:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
representative samsic has a question
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
mr greece for your testimony
 
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
um you know your your mission is to
 
01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:31.990 align:start position:0%
um you know your your mission is to
basically

01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
be the advocate for residential
 
01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:35.510 align:start position:0%
be the advocate for residential
customers

01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
customers
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
um and i i don't know if this is
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
part of your mandate as well but um
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
if if we're just talking only about the
 
01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:47.510 align:start position:0%
if if we're just talking only about the
actual

01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
actual
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
cost of the kilowatt hour of energy
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
um that's one thing do you also consider
 
01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
some of the um ancillar
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
costs that are pro are
 
01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679 align:start position:0%
are generated based on how we generate
 
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
energy and what other impacts they might
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
have on
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
our environment our health our of
 
01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
indeed dependency on other sources of
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
energy is that
 
01:49:19.510 --> 01:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
at all part of your calculations or
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
are you focused solely on what is the
 
01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:23.510 align:start position:0%
are you focused solely on what is the
cheapest

01:49:23.510 --> 01:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
cheapest
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
way of getting a kilowatt of our energy
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative samsich it's a really
 
01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
excellent one
 
01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
my objectives as the consumer advocate
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
are to lower costs for customers as much
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
while empowering customers as much as
 
01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:44.550 align:start position:0%
while empowering customers as much as
possible

01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
i do not consider environmental
 
01:49:50.950 --> 01:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
imperatives to be within my
 
01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
portfolio of advocacy issues and so
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
i don't go to the puc nor do i come here
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
and give you advice about what sort of
 
01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
environmental policy you should pursue
 
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
that said i do think that the puc really
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
does have environmental responsibilities
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
and i was very disappointed a few years
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
ago when i saw the puc basically say
 
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
we don't take we don't take
 
01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
environmental issues into account when
 
01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
we make a decision that's for the
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services i
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
think that's an incorrect statement of
 
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law
 
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
and i certainly think that environmental
 
01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:25.990 align:start position:0%
and i certainly think that environmental
implications

01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
implications
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
of energy related public policy is very
 
01:50:35.030 --> 01:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much any further
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
and allow we have uh representative
 
01:50:47.199 --> 01:50:49.430 align:start position:0%
and allow we have uh representative
brezny

01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
brezny
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
um hi uh one of the questions i have is
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh on on the slide
 
01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
where you showed how the rate is
 
01:50:57.910 --> 01:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
calculated and you had
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
operating expenses um i was wondering if
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
um what the incentives are for the the
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
providers to
 
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
lower their operating systems if they
 
01:51:08.709 --> 01:51:08.719 align:start position:0%
can just submit the amount
 
01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
that the expenses are and then the rate
 
01:51:12.870 --> 01:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
is based on that
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you that's an excellent
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
question uh so
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission has
 
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to exert plenary
 
01:51:24.149 --> 01:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
oversight of the public utilities of the
 
01:51:24.159 --> 01:51:24.870 align:start position:0%
oversight of the public utilities of the
state

01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
and it has the right to inspect all of
 
01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
the utilities books and records so
 
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
the puc when a utility files a rate case
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
does not just take the utility's word
 
01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:34.229 align:start position:0%
does not just take the utility's word
for

01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
what its operating expenses are they are
 
01:51:37.119 --> 01:51:38.310 align:start position:0%
what its operating expenses are they are
investigated

01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
investigated
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
and the commission asks the utilities
 
01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
all sorts of questions about whether
 
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
what they're doing is
 
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh appropriate the standard that the uh
 
01:51:52.149 --> 01:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
puc uses is prudence so if
 
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
a utility is acting in an imprudent
 
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
fashion by basically wasting money
 
01:51:58.629 --> 01:51:58.639 align:start position:0%
that it then wants to recover from
 
01:52:00.629 --> 01:52:00.639 align:start position:0%
ratepayers the regulator is supposed to
 
01:52:02.229 --> 01:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
stop that from happening
 
01:52:05.189 --> 01:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
and i that i think the puc does a pretty
 
01:52:06.870 --> 01:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
good job of that the utilities know that
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
they're under that kind of scrutiny
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
and so i think for the most part they
 
01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
try to do a pretty good job
 
01:52:14.709 --> 01:52:14.719 align:start position:0%
of uh making sure that their operating
 
01:52:14.719 --> 01:52:15.589 align:start position:0%
of uh making sure that their operating
expenses

01:52:15.589 --> 01:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
and their capital investments are
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
prudent but those
 
01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
issues are typically argued about
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh very passionately within the context
 
01:52:26.070 --> 01:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
of rate cases and of course we're there
 
01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:27.030 align:start position:0%
of rate cases and of course we're there
too

01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
skeptically evaluating what it is that
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:34.070 --> 01:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
oh thank you and i have a follow-up
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
question to that if i can yes go ahead
 
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
um so what what incentive do they have
 
01:52:41.350 --> 01:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
to innovate for example i understand
 
01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:41.669 align:start position:0%
to innovate for example i understand
that

01:52:41.669 --> 01:52:41.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
they can present their their books and
 
01:52:45.270 --> 01:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
the books seem reasonable
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
but they can just stay stagnant at those
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
those expenses right
 
01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
what reason do they have to try to try
 
01:52:51.669 --> 01:52:51.679 align:start position:0%
something different
 
01:52:53.669 --> 01:52:53.679 align:start position:0%
or even to lower the cost if they don't
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
have to lower the cost
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
why would they representative i think
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
that is probably the most astute
 
01:53:00.550 --> 01:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
question i have heard
 
01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh this morning so far uh that
 
01:53:06.149 --> 01:53:06.159 align:start position:0%
the issue that you just raised is a very
 
01:53:06.159 --> 01:53:06.870 align:start position:0%
the issue that you just raised is a very
common

01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
common
 
01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
and uh appropriate critique of cost of
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
service rate making
 
01:53:15.030 --> 01:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
it has been remarked many times that it
 
01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
if anything discourages innovation
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
and for that reason there are
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
alternative approaches
 
01:53:25.109 --> 01:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
to rate setting that are
 
01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
talked about all the time and i didn't
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
go into that today just because i didn't
 
01:53:30.149 --> 01:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
think that i had time
 
01:53:33.189 --> 01:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
but that is very much a live issue
 
01:53:38.229 --> 01:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
so representative bresni uh i encourage
 
01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
you to
 
01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh have a private conversation with uh
 
01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
mr crease about that uh subject someday
 
01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you guys can have a
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
a lively exchange about it
 
01:53:56.790 --> 01:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
okay any last questions uh time
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
is getting short and we need to move on
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
so seeing none i will uh once again
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank mr crease for his wonderful uh
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
presentation very informative
 
01:54:12.870 --> 01:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and we'll look
 
01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
forward to seeing you
 
01:54:18.070 --> 01:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
in the various public hearings about the
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
bills you mentioned in your presentation
 
01:54:19.679 --> 01:54:19.990 align:start position:0%
bills you mentioned in your presentation
and

01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
other bills which i'm sure you'll be
 
01:54:23.669 --> 01:54:23.679 align:start position:0%
anxious to
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
talk to us about indeed thank you again
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
very much it's been a great pleasure
 
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so we're going to move
 
01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
along now to
 
01:54:36.149 --> 01:54:36.159 align:start position:0%
our next presenter before we do so
 
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
i will remind everyone that
 
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
um if you're not speaking you should
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
keep your microphone on mute
 
01:54:47.109 --> 01:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
uh that's the key to a good
 
01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
zoom meeting no background noise
 
01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
so thank you for doing that and i will
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
also remind everyone here
 
01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
in case you didn't uh catch it at the
 
01:54:58.709 --> 01:54:58.719 align:start position:0%
beginning of this session
 
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
that we will have a second of these
 
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
orientation meetings
 
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
next friday starting at 10 a.m
 
01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
at that session we will have a
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
presentation by the department of
 
01:55:13.589 --> 01:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
environmental services followed by a
 
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
presentation by the public utilities
 
01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:17.510 align:start position:0%
presentation by the public utilities
commission

01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:55:18.790 --> 01:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
so both of those will be very
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
informative and i encourage you to
 
01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:21.189 align:start position:0%
informative and i encourage you to
attend

both of those sessions
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
and now i will ask
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
the representative from iso new england
 
01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
kate epson to take the floor and give us
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%

from iso new england kate you're on
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
so i see kate is online
 
01:55:53.189 --> 01:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
she's still muted at the moment but now
 
01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
she's sharing her screen so take it away

01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
i i have done zoom before so that took a
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
shockingly long time
 
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
apologies um okay so now you're seeing
 
01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:06.550 align:start position:0%
apologies um okay so now you're seeing
both

01:57:06.550 --> 01:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
correct yes we see both
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
okay great um
 
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
well okay good morning thank you for
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
that introduction
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
um i i'm kate epson and
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
i'm with iso new england i've been there
 
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
for about
 
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
two years now and i am with the external
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
and government affairs team
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
and i i specifically focus on new
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire and maine
 
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
so i hope that i can answer all of your
 
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
questions about iso itself
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
and hopefully the kind of the
 
01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:44.550 align:start position:0%
and hopefully the kind of the
intersection

01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
intersection
 
01:57:48.629 --> 01:57:48.639 align:start position:0%
between new hampshire uh and and the iso
 
01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
i caught a few minutes of don crease's
 
01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:51.910 align:start position:0%
i caught a few minutes of don crease's
presentation

01:57:51.910 --> 01:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
so that was nice to see that he gave you
 
01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
a good
 
01:57:59.189 --> 01:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
context for restructuring
 
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
and iso new england and sort of where we
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
fit in
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire electricity policy so
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
here's a brief overview of what i'm
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
going to cover today
 
01:58:14.229 --> 01:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
i was under the understanding that i'm
 
01:58:16.790 --> 01:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
going to speak for about 40 minutes
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
and it looked like you saved all your
 
01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
questions until the end
 
01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
so i'll try and stop you know to give
 
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
you about 20 minutes for questions
 
01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
of course uh your prerogative if you
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
have any clarifying questions or
 
01:58:30.550 --> 01:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
questions as you go
 
01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
i have no problem being interrupted so i
 
01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
leave it to
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
to you chair to decide
 
01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you miss epson i would prefer
 
01:58:40.870 --> 01:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
saved all our questions for the end but
 
01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh if anybody has an urgent need for a
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
question just raise your hand and
 
01:58:52.470 --> 01:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thanks
 
01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
okay so iso new england um we
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
are the entity in new england that is
 
01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
a few um a few
 
01:59:10.070 --> 01:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
things and the main one is the
 
01:59:11.910 --> 01:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
day-to-day operation
 
01:59:15.350 --> 01:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
of the electric grid and i may say i may
 
01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
use the term
 
01:59:18.870 --> 01:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
bulk power system interchangeably with
 
01:59:19.990 --> 01:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
the grid
 
01:59:22.470 --> 01:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
and that is our regional network here in
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
new england that moves
 
01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
electricity around um it includes
 
01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:28.310 align:start position:0%
electricity around um it includes
generation

01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
generation
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
and the higher voltage transmission it
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
does not include
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
the distribution uh system which is you
 
01:59:36.790 --> 01:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
know the poles and the wires
 
01:59:39.430 --> 01:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
that go directly to your retail meters
 
01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:40.149 align:start position:0%
that go directly to your retail meters
and

01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
that is managed by the distribution
 
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
utility as don spoke about
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
and that is regulated at the retail
 
01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:48.390 align:start position:0%
and that is regulated at the retail
level

01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
we also do system planning for our
 
01:59:53.109 --> 01:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
regional grid
 
01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
and we are regulated as don mentioned
 
01:59:58.070 --> 01:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
federally by the federal energy
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
regulatory commission
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
um a couple other really important
 
02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
things to know about the iso for for
 
02:00:07.589 --> 02:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
those of you who this
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
this entity is a new um a new um
 
02:00:15.510 --> 02:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
organization to learn about we're we're
 
02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
set up
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
to be independent of any of the actors
 
02:00:20.709 --> 02:00:20.719 align:start position:0%
in the electrical system so
 
02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
the iso itself um is an is a technology
 
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
neutral platform
 
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't own any of the generation it
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't own any power plants
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't own any transmission lines
 
02:00:34.070 --> 02:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
all we really own is the building in
 
02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:34.470 align:start position:0%
all we really own is the building in
which

02:00:34.470 --> 02:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
we do the work um you know in a lot of
 
02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
software that that helps us to do that
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
and then we're also independent
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
financially in the sense that we have a
 
02:00:44.709 --> 02:00:44.719 align:start position:0%
very strict code of conduct nobody can
 
02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
have investments in any of these
 
02:00:49.830 --> 02:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh market actors in the system so um
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
that's an important aspect of the
 
02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
that's an important aspect of the
neutrality

02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
neutrality
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
um this slide gives you a nice
 
02:01:00.790 --> 02:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
overview of where the iso kind of sits
 
02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
within the region and federally uh
 
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
don't don't focus on this too much in
 
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
terms of the small print
 
02:01:11.189 --> 02:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
um i will also share all of these slides
 
02:01:12.550 --> 02:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
with your full committee so you can
 
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
always use them
 
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
as reference to go back to they're also
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
always on our website but i
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
this is a specific slideshow i made for
 
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
all of you so i will send this around
 
02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
and that will include
 
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
all of my contact information to for me
 
02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
to always be a resource as you need it
 
02:01:31.270 --> 02:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
um so you know you were regulated by
 
02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:32.149 align:start position:0%
um so you know you were regulated by
ferc

02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
ferc
 
02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
um but we have a lot of stakeholders
 
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
that we interact with
 
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis we have a stakeholder
 
02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
group called kneepool which you might
 
02:01:42.310 --> 02:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
continue to hear about
 
02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
and that's the stakeholder group of the
 
02:01:46.629 --> 02:01:46.639 align:start position:0%
market participants
 
02:01:48.550 --> 02:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know those generators independent
 
02:01:50.070 --> 02:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
generators the utilities the
 
02:01:52.629 --> 02:01:52.639 align:start position:0%
transmission owners
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
the states have an entity where they
 
02:01:57.189 --> 02:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
work together sometimes to deal with
 
02:01:57.199 --> 02:01:57.910 align:start position:0%
work together sometimes to deal with
these

02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
regional iso issues called nesco the new
 
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
england states committee on electricity
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
and and then of course policy makers
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
like all of you as well
 
02:02:12.229 --> 02:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
um so whereas iso new england is
 
02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for the new england portion
 
02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
of the bulk electric system we are part
 
02:02:18.790 --> 02:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
a much larger area and it's called an
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
interconnection area and what that means
 
02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:24.070 align:start position:0%
interconnection area and what that means
is

02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
because all of our electric systems are
 
02:02:27.510 --> 02:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
in interconnected
 
02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
and have to be balanced within one
 
02:02:31.990 --> 02:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
another at a similar frequency
 
02:02:33.990 --> 02:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
and so we're part of this eastern
 
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:35.189 align:start position:0%
and so we're part of this eastern
interconnection

02:02:35.189 --> 02:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
interconnection
 
02:02:37.830 --> 02:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
um that also includes parts of canada
 
02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:38.470 align:start position:0%
um that also includes parts of canada
and

02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
um it's it's the second largest machine
 
02:02:43.350 --> 02:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
in the world
 
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
next to the china china's
 
02:02:47.430 --> 02:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
interconnection in china's grid so
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's this very very large interconnected
 
02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:50.709 align:start position:0%
it's this very very large interconnected
networks

02:02:50.709 --> 02:02:50.719 align:start position:0%
networks
 
02:02:53.109 --> 02:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
of electrons flowing around the country
 
02:02:53.119 --> 02:02:53.830 align:start position:0%
of electrons flowing around the country
and

02:02:53.830 --> 02:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:59.030 --> 02:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:01.270 --> 02:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
so here here's a zoom in a little bit
 
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
more on what new england specifically
 
02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
looks like in terms of its big
 
02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
transmission so that's often described
 
02:03:09.030 --> 02:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
as 345
 
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
kv kilovolts um and then 115
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
kv 245 kv and then often below 115
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh that that stepped down and and
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
becomes the distribution system to some
 
02:03:24.070 --> 02:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
extent but there's there are some
 
02:03:25.350 --> 02:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that
 
02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
um so we manage 9000 miles
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
of high voltage transmission lines um
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
we we manage a lot of interconnections
 
02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
like i said to keep us balanced with
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
adjacent electrical systems um
 
02:03:44.790 --> 02:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
we import and export a lot of energy
 
02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
over the ties that we have with canada
 
02:03:48.790 --> 02:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
and new york
 
02:03:51.510 --> 02:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
on net on a given year we generally
 
02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:52.229 align:start position:0%
on net on a given year we generally
import

02:03:52.229 --> 02:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
import
 
02:03:55.990 --> 02:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
about 19 percent of new england's needs
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
um so you know kind of rule of thumb we
 
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
tend to export
 
02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
more to new york and import more from
 
02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
canada but there
 
02:04:08.550 --> 02:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
it's two-way flows um and then you know
 
02:04:11.830 --> 02:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
81 we would generate uh
 
02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
internally within new england
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:22.629 --> 02:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
uh going to the next slide here
 
02:04:25.510 --> 02:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
these are our three core missions that
 
02:04:26.069 --> 02:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
that we
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
do at the iso and i met i mentioned the
 
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
grid operation
 
02:04:32.229 --> 02:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
and just you know since you can't all
 
02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
have the pleasure of a
 
02:04:35.589 --> 02:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
in-person tour yet uh until we get
 
02:04:37.109 --> 02:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
through this pandemic and we can all be
 
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
back in person here's a quick shot of
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
the control room that we have at iso new
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
england and
 
02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
it's this some of you have seen it some
 
02:04:48.629 --> 02:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
of you got to come last year that was a
 
02:04:49.990 --> 02:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
nice field trip
 
02:04:52.069 --> 02:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
and it's a very very large room the
 
02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
screen is about um
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
maybe 60 80 feet by about 15
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
feet and it shows this two-dimensional
 
02:05:02.149 --> 02:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
drawing of the entire electric system
 
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
and there are about six operators in
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
that room managing that
 
02:05:08.149 --> 02:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
you know on every second of every day
 
02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
and so that's the grid operation piece
 
02:05:12.069 --> 02:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
of what we do
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
that we also importantly administer the
 
02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:15.589 align:start position:0%
that we also importantly administer the
markets

02:05:15.589 --> 02:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
markets
 
02:05:18.069 --> 02:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
um the buying and selling of wholesale
 
02:05:18.079 --> 02:05:19.510 align:start position:0%
um the buying and selling of wholesale
electricity

02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
02:05:22.550 --> 02:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
and we also do power system planning
 
02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
um so that we can say okay what
 
02:05:28.550 --> 02:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
what is our system going to need in 10
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
years how is load
 
02:05:33.270 --> 02:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
changing how are resources changing
 
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
things like that and and clearly we're
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
in a time of a lot of change right now
 
02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
where we're moving to
 
02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:41.679 align:start position:0%
from a lot of traditional sources of
 
02:05:43.589 --> 02:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
generating power
 
02:05:47.109 --> 02:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
like coal and oil and natural gas to
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
more renewable sources of power and
 
02:05:50.079 --> 02:05:50.390 align:start position:0%
more renewable sources of power and
since

02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
since
 
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
our system is quite legacy and was often
 
02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:55.189 align:start position:0%
our system is quite legacy and was often
designed

02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
designed
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
for those more traditional sources of
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
power there are a lot of changes that
 
02:06:00.149 --> 02:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
are coming along with
 
02:06:02.069 --> 02:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
managing this kind of more dynamic
 
02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
two-way flow of
 
02:06:06.310 --> 02:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
electricity in the system so you saw
 
02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:07.030 align:start position:0%
electricity in the system so you saw
that

02:06:07.030 --> 02:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
um so turning to our markets now
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
we as as don said part of restructuring
 
02:06:16.149 --> 02:06:16.159 align:start position:0%
was really to introduce competition
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
into our generation portion of
 
02:06:21.189 --> 02:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
you know generation transmission
 
02:06:22.629 --> 02:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
distribution which are kind of like the
 
02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
three levels of
 
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
of the electricity sector so
 
02:06:29.830 --> 02:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
you know the idea was that if we
 
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
introduce competition
 
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
two generation um
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
firms will firms and businesses and
 
02:06:39.189 --> 02:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
power plants can compete on
 
02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
cost and therefore drive savings toward
 
02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:44.149 align:start position:0%
cost and therefore drive savings toward
consumers

02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
and then the risk of investments rather
 
02:06:48.550 --> 02:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
than having the utility make those
 
02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:49.669 align:start position:0%
than having the utility make those
investments

02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
investments
 
02:06:51.430 --> 02:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
in a power plant that maybe becomes
 
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
uneconomic later
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
it would be independent entities that
 
02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
have to get financing
 
02:06:59.109 --> 02:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
independently and then they assume the
 
02:07:00.069 --> 02:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
risk so
 
02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
that risk doesn't get borne by all the
 
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
consumers of electricity which
 
02:07:06.550 --> 02:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
we essentially all have to be because
 
02:07:08.629 --> 02:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
it's just integral with with our life
 
02:07:12.149 --> 02:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
now um and
 
02:07:14.709 --> 02:07:14.719 align:start position:0%
so that drove a lot of efficiencies it
 
02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
drove more transparency in price
 
02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:17.669 align:start position:0%
drove more transparency in price
structure

02:07:17.669 --> 02:07:17.679 align:start position:0%
structure
 
02:07:21.189 --> 02:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
um and it drove competition and it has
 
02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
driven down costs quite a bit
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
over time um for example last year
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
it you know we we speak in megawatt
 
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
hours you often speak in kilowatt hours
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at your retail bill
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
um so if you multiply that by you know a
 
02:07:38.709 --> 02:07:38.719 align:start position:0%
kilowatt by a thousand
 
02:07:42.310 --> 02:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
is a megawatt so um
 
02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
we're the average price of electricity
 
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
for example at that wholesale level
 
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh ranges from about 30 to 40 dollars
 
02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:50.709 align:start position:0%
uh ranges from about 30 to 40 dollars
per

02:07:50.709 --> 02:07:50.719 align:start position:0%
per
 
02:07:55.109 --> 02:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour
 
02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
so within those markets that the iso
 
02:07:58.079 --> 02:08:00.310 align:start position:0%
so within those markets that the iso
administers

02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
administers
 
02:08:02.310 --> 02:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
they are selecting the most
 
02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:03.830 align:start position:0%
they are selecting the most
cost-efficient

02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
cost-efficient
 
02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
sources of electricity based on bids
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
that the owners of the electricity or
 
02:08:10.069 --> 02:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
the suppliers of the electricity are
 
02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
saying okay
 
02:08:14.310 --> 02:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
we are willing to sell one megawatt hour
 
02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
of our electricity at x price and then
 
02:08:20.069 --> 02:08:20.079 align:start position:0%
there are also bids from those who want
 
02:08:21.750 --> 02:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
to buy that electricity
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
and we have a model and a system
 
02:08:27.669 --> 02:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
that that puts those bids in economic
 
02:08:28.870 --> 02:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
merit order
 
02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
and dispatches the cheapest sources
 
02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:32.790 align:start position:0%
and dispatches the cheapest sources
first

02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
based on reliability and security
 
02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:36.229 align:start position:0%
based on reliability and security
constraints

02:08:36.229 --> 02:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
constraints
 
02:08:38.550 --> 02:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
so that is how you bring you know you
 
02:08:40.229 --> 02:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
bring down cost because if you want to
 
02:08:41.669 --> 02:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
if you want to have
 
02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
a sale you want to get cleared in that
 
02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
dispatch engine and so it
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
gives it an incentive to drive down
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
costs um
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
and then um so that's the energy market
 
02:08:58.149 --> 02:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
and then we also have an ancillary
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
services market
 
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
that provides some very um important
 
02:09:02.550 --> 02:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
services that
 
02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
beyond energy things like reserves
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
things like
 
02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
um voltage support and some other
 
02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:09.830 align:start position:0%
um voltage support and some other
essentials

02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
essentials
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
for the power system that probably
 
02:09:15.669 --> 02:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
it's a smaller portion of market in
 
02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
terms of volume of
 
02:09:19.750 --> 02:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
money um and services but that that may
 
02:09:21.189 --> 02:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
grow over time
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
um and then we also have this
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
interesting market called the forward
 
02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
capacity market
 
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
and that is the way that new england
 
02:09:30.870 --> 02:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
handles this concept that don had
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned um called resource adequacy
 
02:09:37.510 --> 02:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
so the iso has authority
 
02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
over ensuring resource adequacy on
 
02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:40.550 align:start position:0%
over ensuring resource adequacy on
behalf

02:09:40.550 --> 02:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
behalf
 
02:09:43.830 --> 02:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
of behalf of all the states um
 
02:09:46.709 --> 02:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
and it's this interesting it's this
 
02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
interesting juxtaposition because
 
02:09:50.709 --> 02:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
whereas the iso this regional entity
 
02:09:52.550 --> 02:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's federally regulated
 
02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
has that authority to ensure resource
 
02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy the states themselves have the
 
02:09:59.270 --> 02:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to choose which resources
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
that they want to build
 
02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
so the way we have pursued
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
resource adequacy is through a
 
02:10:08.229 --> 02:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
competitive market called the forward
 
02:10:09.589 --> 02:10:09.599 align:start position:0%
capacity market
 
02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
and what that does is it looks out three
 
02:10:14.069 --> 02:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
years into the future
 
02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
and says okay what do we need three
 
02:10:17.669 --> 02:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
years from now to ensure that we can
 
02:10:17.679 --> 02:10:18.629 align:start position:0%
years from now to ensure that we can
meet

02:10:18.629 --> 02:10:18.639 align:start position:0%
meet
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
all of the needs of all of our consumers
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
in new england
 
02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
and then it has a competitive auction to
 
02:10:26.629 --> 02:10:26.639 align:start position:0%
kind of assign
 
02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
assign obligations to different
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
resources in terms of
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
them guaranteeing that they will provide
 
02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
some level of capacity
 
02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
in the future and when i say capacity
 
02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
generally that's measured in megawatts
 
02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
and then when they provide the energy
 
02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
they're delivering that energy and
 
02:10:49.030 --> 02:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
we have an upcoming capacity auction we
 
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
have them only once a year
 
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
and the upcoming one is in february it's
 
02:10:56.470 --> 02:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
always the
 
02:10:58.629 --> 02:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
day after the super bowl interestingly
 
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
enough and i'm not sure why
 
02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
that uh happened that way but it's
 
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
always very fun
 
02:11:09.270 --> 02:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
so here's a nice uh ch bar chart showing
 
02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:09.990 align:start position:0%
so here's a nice uh ch bar chart showing
how

02:11:09.990 --> 02:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
the money flows among these three
 
02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
markets that i just went over the energy
 
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
market the ancillary market and the
 
02:11:18.390 --> 02:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
forward capacity market
 
02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
um you know the greenish teal is the
 
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
energy market
 
02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
and and historically that's been where a
 
02:11:25.589 --> 02:11:25.599 align:start position:0%
lot of the bulk of the money flows so
 
02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the way you know
 
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
if you're uh a generator it's where you
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
know you plan on making most of your
 
02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:31.589 align:start position:0%
know you plan on making most of your
money

02:11:31.589 --> 02:11:31.599 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:11:33.990 --> 02:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
but depending on what the final clearing
 
02:11:35.430 --> 02:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
price also is in the
 
02:11:38.709 --> 02:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
forward capacity market you um
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
that goes up and down uh with over time
 
02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
with supply dynamics you know
 
02:11:45.750 --> 02:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
for a hypothetical situation let's say
 
02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
there was a year
 
02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
where there were a lot of resources
 
02:11:50.709 --> 02:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
looking to retire
 
02:11:53.109 --> 02:11:53.119 align:start position:0%
and it looked like we might be short on
 
02:11:53.119 --> 02:11:54.310 align:start position:0%
and it looked like we might be short on
capacity

02:11:54.310 --> 02:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
02:11:56.310 --> 02:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
then prices might go up and then that
 
02:11:57.750 --> 02:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
would attract new reese's
 
02:11:59.430 --> 02:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
resources going forward because they say
 
02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
okay i can
 
02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
that works for my my um business model i
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
can build
 
02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
x power plant if i know i'm going to get
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
these revenues combined with what i
 
02:12:12.229 --> 02:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
expect to get in the energy market that
 
02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
um here's a nice um
 
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
snapshot of different of some you know
 
02:12:25.669 --> 02:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
more statistics about kind of how we
 
02:12:28.950 --> 02:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
look at this regional energy system
 
02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
we have about 7.2 million
 
02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
retail electric customers in new england
 
02:12:36.629 --> 02:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
for our 15 million
 
02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
person population you all know the
 
02:12:41.109 --> 02:12:41.119 align:start position:0%
population of new hampshire it's about
 
02:12:42.310 --> 02:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
1.3 million
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
so that translates to maybe about five
 
02:12:46.950 --> 02:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
or six hundred thousand electric
 
02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:48.950 align:start position:0%
or six hundred thousand electric
customers

02:12:48.950 --> 02:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
customers
 
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you'll hear a nice presentation
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
from eversource and liberty and unitil
 
02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:53.510 align:start position:0%
from eversource and liberty and unitil
and

02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:55.589 --> 02:12:55.599 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire electric co-op who are
 
02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
your you know your retail
 
02:12:59.430 --> 02:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
utility customers and they'll give you
 
02:13:01.030 --> 02:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
more granularity
 
02:13:04.470 --> 02:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
on new hampshire in that respect
 
02:13:07.589 --> 02:13:07.599 align:start position:0%
we we had us we had an all-time peak
 
02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
demand to give you a sense of kind of
 
02:13:11.430 --> 02:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
what are we using as a whole region
 
02:13:13.990 --> 02:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
that it was in 2006 it was quite a while
 
02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:14.550 align:start position:0%
that it was in 2006 it was quite a while
ago

02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:13:18.069 --> 02:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
we had a peak of 28 000 megawatts
 
02:13:21.030 --> 02:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
and that happened on a summer afternoon
 
02:13:22.950 --> 02:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
generally our system
 
02:13:24.790 --> 02:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
peaks in the summer meaning we're using
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
the most electricity
 
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
on a very hot summer day driven you know
 
02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
by air conditioning load
 
02:13:35.589 --> 02:13:35.599 align:start position:0%
and um but we do see seasonal peaks as
 
02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
well so we see
 
02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
our highest all-time peak in the winter
 
02:13:40.629 --> 02:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
you'll see there was about 22
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
800 megawatts and that was back in 2004
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
and um these
 
02:13:51.910 --> 02:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
peaks may shift over time um for reasons
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
of you know electrification that may
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
change the dynamics of how we're using
 
02:13:57.440 --> 02:13:58.629 align:start position:0%
change the dynamics of how we're using
electricity

02:13:58.629 --> 02:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
02:14:01.030 --> 02:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
you know will some of our heating that
 
02:14:03.109 --> 02:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
is very driven by oil
 
02:14:05.189 --> 02:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
propane things like that will that shift
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
to more electrical
 
02:14:10.870 --> 02:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
heating over time how will
 
02:14:13.990 --> 02:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
the ev market continue to change
 
02:14:15.750 --> 02:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
so there's a there's a lot at play and
 
02:14:17.589 --> 02:14:17.599 align:start position:0%
we try to forecast these trends
 
02:14:20.950 --> 02:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh to the best of our ability using um
 
02:14:24.629 --> 02:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
data from from all the states directly
 
02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
there's also a lot of energy efficiency
 
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
that drives how much we use
 
02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
um most of new england is very
 
02:14:32.639 --> 02:14:33.430 align:start position:0%
um most of new england is very
aggressive

02:14:33.430 --> 02:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
aggressive
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
on investing in energy efficiency and so
 
02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
that's actually driven down
 
02:14:42.069 --> 02:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
driven down our regionals use of
 
02:14:42.079 --> 02:14:42.950 align:start position:0%
driven down our regionals use of
electricity

02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:49.030 --> 02:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
we are seeing a little bit of a growth
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
rate in our 10-year forecast
 
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of overall electricity use now
 
02:14:55.510 --> 02:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
going forward and
 
02:14:58.310 --> 02:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
we think that is largely due to these
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
increasing trends toward
 
02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
electrification of uh sectors that were
 
02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:08.629 --> 02:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
and then there's also significant
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
deployment of
 
02:15:12.310 --> 02:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
behind the meter solar so you might see
 
02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
you see it here as
 
02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
btm solar that's what btm means it means
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
behind the meter
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
um and there's a lot there are hundreds
 
02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
of thousands of those systems
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
around new england you know a good deal
 
02:15:29.109 --> 02:15:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:30.870 --> 02:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
so what you know what do what do we have
 
02:15:32.310 --> 02:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of power plants
 
02:15:34.149 --> 02:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
um and what do we have for you know what
 
02:15:36.149 --> 02:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
do we have on standby
 
02:15:37.750 --> 02:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
what can we kind of expect because we
 
02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
have to keep a very clear snapshot of of
 
02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
what we have to operate the system right
 
02:15:44.709 --> 02:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
now we have about 350 dispatchable
 
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
generators so that means that those
 
02:15:50.550 --> 02:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
power plants can respond to
 
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
orders from the iso to produce more to
 
02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:54.069 align:start position:0%
orders from the iso to produce more to
produce

02:15:54.069 --> 02:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
produce
 
02:15:56.709 --> 02:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
less they can kind of ramp up and down
 
02:15:56.719 --> 02:15:57.669 align:start position:0%
less they can kind of ramp up and down
there

02:15:57.669 --> 02:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
there's generation that is less
 
02:16:02.830 --> 02:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
dispatchable or moderately dispatchable
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
um we've made some changes for example
 
02:16:06.480 --> 02:16:07.109 align:start position:0%
um we've made some changes for example
as

02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
more wind came online to allow wind
 
02:16:13.510 --> 02:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
to be more dispatchable within kind of a
 
02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:14.229 align:start position:0%
to be more dispatchable within kind of a
bandwidth

02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
bandwidth
 
02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
of what they expect to be producing in a
 
02:16:17.990 --> 02:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
given time
 
02:16:20.790 --> 02:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
um but then we have a lot of uh we have
 
02:16:22.470 --> 02:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of resources like i mentioned
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
that are not really visible to the iso
 
02:16:26.310 --> 02:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
that are behind the meter as well and
 
02:16:29.750 --> 02:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
those clearly are not dispatchable
 
02:16:31.430 --> 02:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
we have a very large interconnection
 
02:16:33.669 --> 02:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
queue of resources seeking to come into
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
our system i'm going to get to that
 
02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:36.150 align:start position:0%
our system i'm going to get to that
later

02:16:36.150 --> 02:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
later
 
02:16:38.950 --> 02:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
and then we also have a lot of demand
 
02:16:41.349 --> 02:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
response resources meaning you can
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
change the amount of your load and that
 
02:16:47.589 --> 02:16:47.599 align:start position:0%
will be treated as supply
 
02:16:49.669 --> 02:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
according to dispatch instructions and
 
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
then also
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
more passive demand side resources like
 
02:16:55.830 --> 02:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency
 
02:16:57.750 --> 02:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
but those can also participate in our
 
02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
forward capacity market
 
02:17:05.349 --> 02:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
um so you know there you saw that there
 
02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
are about
 
02:17:08.629 --> 02:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
350 dispatchable generators but then
 
02:17:11.349 --> 02:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
there are about 500 buyers and sellers
 
02:17:13.349 --> 02:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
in the market so that's kind of the
 
02:17:15.270 --> 02:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
universe of what we call our market
 
02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:17.030 align:start position:0%
universe of what we call our market
participants

02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
participants
 
02:17:20.230 --> 02:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
um there there are billions of dollars
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
transacted in these markets
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
um so we have a very large settlements
 
02:17:28.389 --> 02:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
department for example that um
 
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know invoices and um you know
 
02:17:34.469 --> 02:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
makes payments and things like that it's
 
02:17:35.190 --> 02:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
a it was
 
02:17:37.589 --> 02:17:37.599 align:start position:0%
that markets were worth about 5.6
 
02:17:37.599 --> 02:17:38.629 align:start position:0%
that markets were worth about 5.6
billion

02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
billion
 
02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
for example in 2020.
 
02:17:44.709 --> 02:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
all right so here's a nice chart that's
 
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
showing how our resources are really
 
02:17:48.469 --> 02:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
shifting over time
 
02:17:51.990 --> 02:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
the blue shows the resources that we had
 
02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
um into the year 2000 and then the teal
 
02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:56.230 align:start position:0%
um into the year 2000 and then the teal
green

02:17:56.230 --> 02:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
green
 
02:18:00.070 --> 02:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
bar shows the resources uh in 2020 so
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
you'll and this is capacity so this is
 
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
important to note because
 
02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
the very next slide i'm going to we're
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to look at a similar visual but
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to be based on
 
02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
energy so capacity remember are those
 
02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:11.349 align:start position:0%
energy so capacity remember are those
megawatts

02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
megawatts
 
02:18:13.669 --> 02:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of your nameplate capacity if
 
02:18:14.709 --> 02:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
you were producing
 
02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
all you could at a given moment that's
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
the max of what you could produce
 
02:18:22.469 --> 02:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
um we we had a lot of
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
nuclear in new england we're down to
 
02:18:26.309 --> 02:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
actually two
 
02:18:28.389 --> 02:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
nuclear power plants one as you know is
 
02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
in seabrook here in new hampshire and
 
02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
then the others in connecticut
 
02:18:36.070 --> 02:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
we have much less oil
 
02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
and you'll see even though it looks like
 
02:18:39.669 --> 02:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
we haven't had a dramatic reduction in
 
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
terms of oil capacity
 
02:18:43.750 --> 02:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's very very rarely run so it gives
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
very little energy into our system
 
02:18:48.790 --> 02:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
we've had a really large increase in our
 
02:18:51.669 --> 02:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
natural gas resources
 
02:18:54.870 --> 02:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
slight decrease in hydro and then
 
02:18:57.910 --> 02:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
renewables are growing the fastest but
 
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
it looks similar because they started
 
02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
out from a very small level
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
so there is even though it's a rapid
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
change in absolute numbers
 
02:19:07.830 --> 02:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
it will take a while to kind of make
 
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
gains into the percentage of the market
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
that they actually
 
02:19:13.830 --> 02:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
hold so looking now at this
 
02:19:17.270 --> 02:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of energy you'll see we still
 
02:19:19.750 --> 02:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
get about 30 percent of our energy from
 
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
just those two
 
02:19:24.070 --> 02:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
nuclear plants we get
 
02:19:26.389 --> 02:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
less than one percent of our energy over
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
the course of a given year from
 
02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
oil or coal so very very very little
 
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
they're generally dispatched if it's
 
02:19:38.309 --> 02:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
extremely cold maybe if it's extremely
 
02:19:40.629 --> 02:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
hot and those energy prices go very very
 
02:19:40.639 --> 02:19:41.429 align:start position:0%
hot and those energy prices go very very
high

02:19:41.429 --> 02:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
high
 
02:19:44.790 --> 02:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
and then it's economic for them to run
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
natural gas we still get a lot of energy
 
02:19:48.389 --> 02:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
from a lot of capacity and a lot of
 
02:19:48.399 --> 02:19:49.190 align:start position:0%
from a lot of capacity and a lot of
energy

02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
energy
 
02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
and then you'll see that in terms of
 
02:19:52.389 --> 02:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
energy numbers the
 
02:19:54.469 --> 02:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
hydro and renewables categories are
 
02:19:54.479 --> 02:19:58.389 align:start position:0%
hydro and renewables categories are
increasing

02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
so another important thing to keep in
 
02:20:02.950 --> 02:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
mind in terms of this
 
02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
electric system that we have here in new
 
02:20:06.070 --> 02:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
england is
 
02:20:08.550 --> 02:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
the prices at the wholesale level are
 
02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:20:12.469 --> 02:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
linked to natural gas prices so if
 
02:20:15.750 --> 02:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
natural gas is cheap often the electric
 
02:20:16.469 --> 02:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
prices are
 
02:20:18.870 --> 02:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
cheap because that unit that clears the
 
02:20:19.830 --> 02:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
price in the mark
 
02:20:21.990 --> 02:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know in the whole market called the
 
02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
marginal unit
 
02:20:25.990 --> 02:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
that is often a gas unit and so that
 
02:20:27.270 --> 02:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
will set the price for
 
02:20:29.830 --> 02:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
for everyone else that is going to
 
02:20:31.990 --> 02:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
provide energy in that moment
 
02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
um prices have been very low and in
 
02:20:36.790 --> 02:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
terms of natural gas during this
 
02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:38.070 align:start position:0%
terms of natural gas during this
pandemic

02:20:38.070 --> 02:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
um you'll see you'll see these spikes
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
we've labeled some of them in terms of
 
02:20:42.479 --> 02:20:43.270 align:start position:0%
we've labeled some of them in terms of
time

02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:20:45.750 --> 02:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
they are often in the winter and so
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
here's why that is
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
we um we don't have indigenous fuels
 
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
um in any in any we don't have any
 
02:20:55.349 --> 02:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels here in new england you all
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
know that so we
 
02:21:00.469 --> 02:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
import them via pipeline or via ship
 
02:21:03.910 --> 02:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
or via train and so
 
02:21:06.870 --> 02:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
the gas flows generally on pipelines but
 
02:21:08.230 --> 02:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
we do import some
 
02:21:12.150 --> 02:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
lng liquid natural gas
 
02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
and um so those pipelines though also
 
02:21:17.190 --> 02:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
supply the natural gas for
 
02:21:19.990 --> 02:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
our heating load in the winter and it's
 
02:21:22.150 --> 02:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
contracted to serve those end use
 
02:21:23.910 --> 02:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
customers for heating
 
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
um first and so when
 
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of need on very cold days
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
and prolonged cold
 
02:21:35.349 --> 02:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
that gas is generally flowing to um
 
02:21:36.309 --> 02:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
heating needs
 
02:21:39.270 --> 02:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
and so there's less gas available to run
 
02:21:41.349 --> 02:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
electrical generation on so the prices
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
tend to go
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
up um for when those electrical
 
02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
generators can actually obtain that gas
 
02:21:48.550 --> 02:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
to run a power plant
 
02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
and so that's why you see those links in
 
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:00.150 --> 02:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
um so like i said
 
02:22:03.270 --> 02:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
we um we have many stakeholders
 
02:22:06.469 --> 02:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
and so we we are operating the grid but
 
02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
we're keeping in mind um
 
02:22:11.670 --> 02:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of state policies that
 
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
play here and they have a lot of goals
 
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
that they would like they'd like to meet
 
02:22:17.110 --> 02:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
and many of them
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
are mandated legislatively and so
 
02:22:23.190 --> 02:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
we are very much looking in new england
 
02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
toward a decarbonized system for our
 
02:22:27.030 --> 02:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
electrical power system
 
02:22:29.750 --> 02:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
because as you can see in this chart
 
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
every state except for new hampshire has
 
02:22:34.870 --> 02:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
a mandate to reduce their
 
02:22:39.190 --> 02:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide emissions by 80 by 2050.
 
02:22:42.150 --> 02:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
um and many of the states also have a
 
02:22:44.469 --> 02:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
very aggressive renewable portfolio
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
standards meaning
 
02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
they want to obtain very high
 
02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:49.270 align:start position:0%
they want to obtain very high
percentages

02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
percentages
 
02:22:51.910 --> 02:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
of their electric resources from
 
02:22:54.309 --> 02:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
renewable energy sources as well so
 
02:22:57.510 --> 02:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
the iso takes this into account and we
 
02:22:57.520 --> 02:22:57.830 align:start position:0%
the iso takes this into account and we
say

02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:22:59.349 --> 02:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
okay it looks like a lot of the
 
02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
resources that are going to start coming
 
02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
online in the future are going to be
 
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
renewable for these decarbonization and
 
02:23:06.150 --> 02:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
clean energy
 
02:23:09.349 --> 02:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
reasons and for their policy preferences
 
02:23:11.830 --> 02:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
so um what do what do we need to do to
 
02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:18.950 --> 02:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
here's here's a chart that's showing you
 
02:23:20.070 --> 02:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
kind of the
 
02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
renewable energy portfolio standards of
 
02:23:23.590 --> 02:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
the new england states
 
02:23:25.270 --> 02:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
for their class one and their new
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
resources so new hampshire for example
 
02:23:27.840 --> 02:23:28.150 align:start position:0%
resources so new hampshire for example
has

02:23:28.150 --> 02:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:23:31.429 --> 02:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
a four class renewable portfolio system
 
02:23:33.830 --> 02:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
um so this is showing new hampshire's
 
02:23:35.910 --> 02:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
class one and a little bit of class two
 
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
and then you know sim we tried to do an
 
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
apples to apples comparison
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
for the other states rps's as well
 
02:23:47.270 --> 02:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
so okay turning to so what do we see
 
02:23:49.670 --> 02:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
that wants to come in to participate in
 
02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
providing electricity in new england
 
02:23:54.790 --> 02:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
um we're seeing um our interconnection
 
02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:55.830 align:start position:0%
um we're seeing um our interconnection
queue

02:23:55.830 --> 02:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
queue
 
02:23:59.750 --> 02:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
which is the cue that has to um
 
02:24:01.590 --> 02:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
everyone that wants to interconnect with
 
02:24:04.070 --> 02:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
the existing bulk power system
 
02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
has to apply we have to do a study to
 
02:24:09.190 --> 02:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
make sure there's no negative
 
02:24:12.389 --> 02:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
impacts on the system and then you know
 
02:24:14.550 --> 02:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
we proceed from there there are also a
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
lot of state level permits that have to
 
02:24:18.150 --> 02:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
happen for these types of proposals that
 
02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
we have no jurisdiction over
 
02:24:22.230 --> 02:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
um but what we do is we study the
 
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
impacts to
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
the existing bulk power system and so
 
02:24:27.110 --> 02:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay what do we see in that queue
 
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
the queue is very large today it has
 
02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:30.550 align:start position:0%
the queue is very large today it has
over

02:24:30.550 --> 02:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:24:34.389 --> 02:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
24 000 megawatts in it and as i said
 
02:24:37.830 --> 02:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
um our peak of our entire system was 28
 
02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
000 megawatts so
 
02:24:41.670 --> 02:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
significant resources are interested in
 
02:24:43.590 --> 02:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
getting built here in new england
 
02:24:46.870 --> 02:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
and 63 of those are wind
 
02:24:49.110 --> 02:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
now that's mostly offshore wind at this
 
02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:49.990 align:start position:0%
now that's mostly offshore wind at this
point

02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
um much much less on onshore it used to
 
02:24:55.270 --> 02:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
be more onshore but
 
02:24:58.870 --> 02:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
onshores is um a lot of those have been
 
02:24:59.830 --> 02:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
pulled for the q
 
02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
from the queues um we also have over
 
02:25:04.389 --> 02:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
4000 megawatts of solar
 
02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
looking to inter interconnect and that
 
02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
does not include the behind the meter
 
02:25:09.990 --> 02:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
solar that we do
 
02:25:13.270 --> 02:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
not have full visibility over always
 
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
um it's also
 
02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
about a lot of battery storage so over
 
02:25:22.070 --> 02:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
3000 megawatts of battery storage it's
 
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
15 percent of our overall
 
02:25:24.870 --> 02:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
interconnection queue
 
02:25:26.950 --> 02:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
there was almost no storage in the queue
 
02:25:28.950 --> 02:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
even just two years ago
 
02:25:31.190 --> 02:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
um two years ago if you looked at the
 
02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:31.990 align:start position:0%
um two years ago if you looked at the
same

02:25:31.990 --> 02:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:25:34.950 --> 02:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
pie chart that natural gas sliver that's
 
02:25:36.790 --> 02:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
in blue that's only four percent
 
02:25:39.830 --> 02:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
that would have been about 60 so it's re
 
02:25:41.590 --> 02:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
the dynamics have really shifted in
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
terms of what is looking to come online
 
02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
to the system
 
02:25:46.389 --> 02:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
and then that that little table you see
 
02:25:48.070 --> 02:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
next to
 
02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
the uh the pie chart that shows all of
 
02:25:53.110 --> 02:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
the proposals by state
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
and our queue is actually public if
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
you're really interested in looking at
 
02:25:57.590 --> 02:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
it on our website
 
02:25:59.670 --> 02:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
you can't see proprietary information
 
02:26:01.349 --> 02:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
like who specifically the developer is
 
02:26:02.790 --> 02:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
and things like that but you can see a
 
02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
lot of information about
 
02:26:06.630 --> 02:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
what the technology is what stage is it
 
02:26:08.710 --> 02:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
in um
 
02:26:10.950 --> 02:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
and kind of where it is along in the
 
02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
process because every
 
02:26:14.710 --> 02:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
every resource is assigned a cue number
 
02:26:15.750 --> 02:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
because we try to
 
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
do this on a first come first serve
 
02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:21.190 align:start position:0%
do this on a first come first serve
basis

02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
basis
 
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
um just a little snapshot on storage
 
02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
because it's been it's becoming
 
02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
increasingly important for
 
02:26:30.389 --> 02:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
for many reasons we do have some
 
02:26:32.469 --> 02:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
large-scale storage on our new england
 
02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
system it's pretty fascinating
 
02:26:37.110 --> 02:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's called pumped hydro storage
 
02:26:39.429 --> 02:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
and it's essentially
 
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
water being pulled out of a river or a
 
02:26:44.309 --> 02:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
significant body of water
 
02:26:46.710 --> 02:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
pumped up a mountain to a reservoir and
 
02:26:47.910 --> 02:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
then it can be released
 
02:26:49.830 --> 02:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
very quickly to be run through a turbine
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
to produce
 
02:26:54.150 --> 02:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
um a lot of energy so we have
 
02:26:57.349 --> 02:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
almost 2000 megawatts of that in new
 
02:26:59.910 --> 02:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
england and they so they can provide
 
02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
that level of power within 10 minutes
 
02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
and then they can sustain that level of
 
02:27:06.710 --> 02:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
power for about seven hours
 
02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
so storage whether it be that type of
 
02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
technology or battery storage or other
 
02:27:13.990 --> 02:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
types of storage
 
02:27:16.230 --> 02:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
this is going to be an increasingly
 
02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:17.349 align:start position:0%
this is going to be an increasingly
important

02:27:17.349 --> 02:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:27:19.429 --> 02:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
resource in terms of balancing our
 
02:27:21.110 --> 02:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
system as we have more and more
 
02:27:22.630 --> 02:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
resources that
 
02:27:25.030 --> 02:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
are variable you know based on weather
 
02:27:27.270 --> 02:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
or other attributes
 
02:27:28.870 --> 02:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
because they are renewable sources of
 
02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:32.150 align:start position:0%
because they are renewable sources of
power

02:27:32.150 --> 02:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:35.190 --> 02:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
because most of you know this but it's
 
02:27:38.230 --> 02:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
just always good to remind ourselves
 
02:27:40.230 --> 02:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's always been very challenging
 
02:27:42.309 --> 02:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
to store electrons you know they flow in
 
02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
a path of
 
02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
least resistance and they need to be
 
02:27:45.840 --> 02:27:47.190 align:start position:0%
least resistance and they need to be
consumed

02:27:47.190 --> 02:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
consumed
 
02:27:50.550 --> 02:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
as they're produced so it's
 
02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
we have to balance the system in terms
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
of exact supply and exact demand
 
02:27:57.429 --> 02:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
on every single moment in order to
 
02:27:59.270 --> 02:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
maintain the reliability and integrity
 
02:28:01.349 --> 02:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
of the system
 
02:28:03.750 --> 02:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
so being able to store those electrons
 
02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:04.630 align:start position:0%
so being able to store those electrons
kinetically

02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
kinetically
 
02:28:07.190 --> 02:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
chemically or otherwise is is a very
 
02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
powerful tool
 
02:28:16.469 --> 02:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
this so the states are also pursuing um
 
02:28:18.950 --> 02:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
lots of energy efficiency as i as i
 
02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:19.590 align:start position:0%
lots of energy efficiency as i as i
mentioned

02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:28:22.389 --> 02:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
through um programs often administered
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
by the utilities sometimes it's a third
 
02:28:24.479 --> 02:28:26.070 align:start position:0%
by the utilities sometimes it's a third
party

02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
party
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
and we we will see that continue to grow
 
02:28:31.190 --> 02:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
these are our forecasts
 
02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
um we we do 10-year forecasts every year
 
02:28:34.160 --> 02:28:34.630 align:start position:0%
um we we do 10-year forecasts every year
so

02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
it we're expecting at least 5600
 
02:28:39.670 --> 02:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
megawatts of energy efficiency in the
 
02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:40.710 align:start position:0%
megawatts of energy efficiency in the
system

02:28:40.710 --> 02:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:28:45.429 --> 02:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
um by 2029 uh 7 800 megawatts of
 
02:28:47.670 --> 02:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
photovoltaic solar photovoltaics in the
 
02:28:49.429 --> 02:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
system by 2029
 
02:28:52.469 --> 02:28:52.479 align:start position:0%
and then a lot of wind about 15 000
 
02:28:53.990 --> 02:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
megawatts of wind
 
02:28:56.710 --> 02:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
um on the system and so you know as i
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
said for a system that peaked at 28 000
 
02:28:59.040 --> 02:28:59.270 align:start position:0%
said for a system that peaked at 28 000
the

02:28:59.270 --> 02:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:29:02.070 --> 02:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
this is a lot of um this is a big shift
 
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
in kind of
 
02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
the resource mix so you know why why do
 
02:29:07.349 --> 02:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
we look so closely at these
 
02:29:09.190 --> 02:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
at these resources like efficiency and
 
02:29:11.110 --> 02:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
solar and behind the meter or in front
 
02:29:11.830 --> 02:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
of the meter
 
02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
because they really change the dynamics
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
of how we plan the system
 
02:29:17.429 --> 02:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
and um there are a lot of cost
 
02:29:19.590 --> 02:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
implications so
 
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the very top line that's
 
02:29:22.790 --> 02:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
our gross peak
 
02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
so if we had if we did no energy
 
02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:27.270 align:start position:0%
so if we had if we did no energy
efficiency

02:29:27.270 --> 02:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
if we had no solar um behind the meter
 
02:29:30.479 --> 02:29:31.750 align:start position:0%
if we had no solar um behind the meter
pv

02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
pv
 
02:29:34.309 --> 02:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
this that top line is what our peak
 
02:29:36.309 --> 02:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
would look like over time it would grow
 
02:29:37.990 --> 02:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
so that would mean okay we need more
 
02:29:39.830 --> 02:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
supply over time
 
02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
but that drops when you add in the next
 
02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:43.030 align:start position:0%
but that drops when you add in the next
line

02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:29:45.270 --> 02:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
you net out essentially the behind the
 
02:29:47.429 --> 02:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
meter solar so you're like okay
 
02:29:49.990 --> 02:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
we won't need as much to meet that peak
 
02:29:51.830 --> 02:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
and then the green line is when you
 
02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
also net out um energy efficiency and pv
 
02:29:57.190 --> 02:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
and you see that the peak actually
 
02:29:59.429 --> 02:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
starts to uh decline
 
02:30:03.429 --> 02:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
over time so that means that we have to
 
02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
buy less in our forward capacity auction
 
02:30:10.389 --> 02:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
um we transact fewer megawatt hours in
 
02:30:11.910 --> 02:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
the energy market
 
02:30:15.030 --> 02:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
and um so there are significant
 
02:30:17.910 --> 02:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
and uh savings on the on the consumer
 
02:30:17.920 --> 02:30:18.469 align:start position:0%
and uh savings on the on the consumer
end

02:30:18.469 --> 02:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
end
 
02:30:20.469 --> 02:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
and so similar similar dynamics for
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
overall energies
 
02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:29.990 --> 02:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
this is another um snapshot that shows
 
02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:30.469 align:start position:0%
this is another um snapshot that shows
the

02:30:30.469 --> 02:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
increases in the solar pv resources over
 
02:30:35.349 --> 02:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
time by state so you can see new
 
02:30:36.870 --> 02:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire's numbers
 
02:30:40.150 --> 02:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
you can see um you can see how dramatic
 
02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
massachusetts really is to this regional
 
02:30:44.389 --> 02:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
dynamic and contribution of pv
 
02:30:46.309 --> 02:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
they have over a hundred thousand
 
02:30:47.990 --> 02:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
installations of solar
 
02:30:49.990 --> 02:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
around the state right now most of that
 
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
is not visible to the iso that's
 
02:30:53.670 --> 02:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
there they're essentially acting as load
 
02:30:55.429 --> 02:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
reducers on the system from our
 
02:30:59.429 --> 02:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:02.469 --> 02:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
um so another um another
 
02:31:06.070 --> 02:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
dynamic that is happening from
 
02:31:08.389 --> 02:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
increased solar penetration on our
 
02:31:09.830 --> 02:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
system whether it's
 
02:31:11.750 --> 02:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know behind a retail meter or if
 
02:31:13.349 --> 02:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
it's interconnected to the bulk power
 
02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
system is
 
02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
it's shifting our load curves that we
 
02:31:18.560 --> 02:31:19.190 align:start position:0%
it's shifting our load curves that we
see

02:31:19.190 --> 02:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:31:22.630 --> 02:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
on any on a given day so every day
 
02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
you can look at a load curve that was
 
02:31:27.670 --> 02:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
forecasted by iso forecasters saying
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
here's what we expect
 
02:31:31.830 --> 02:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
the load to look like for today here's
 
02:31:31.840 --> 02:31:32.309 align:start position:0%
the load to look like for today here's
the

02:31:32.309 --> 02:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:34.630 --> 02:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
energy that we expect to clear in the
 
02:31:37.510 --> 02:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
market to serve that demand
 
02:31:40.550 --> 02:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
and normally before we saw a lot of
 
02:31:42.309 --> 02:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
solar on our system
 
02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
you would see demand work like the top
 
02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
dotted line over the course of the day
 
02:31:48.469 --> 02:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
see it's
 
02:31:51.670 --> 02:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
very very low you know at about four a.m
 
02:31:54.790 --> 02:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
this people start to wake up they start
 
02:31:54.800 --> 02:31:55.110 align:start position:0%
this people start to wake up they start
to

02:31:55.110 --> 02:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:31:57.349 --> 02:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
get ready for work you know activity
 
02:31:57.359 --> 02:31:58.710 align:start position:0%
get ready for work you know activity
increases

02:31:58.710 --> 02:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
increases
 
02:32:01.750 --> 02:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
until it peaks at about lunchtime and
 
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
then there's a little
 
02:32:04.389 --> 02:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
dip and what everyone's using in the
 
02:32:06.950 --> 02:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon and then it kind of goes back
 
02:32:09.429 --> 02:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
up for the evening a bit before people
 
02:32:11.349 --> 02:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
you know start going to bed and
 
02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
demand starts to drop off again for the
 
02:32:14.630 --> 02:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
for the night but
 
02:32:16.550 --> 02:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
now what we'll see so on a day where
 
02:32:17.830 --> 02:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's sunny
 
02:32:19.750 --> 02:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's very sunny it's cool this often
 
02:32:21.270 --> 02:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
happens you can see in the spring this
 
02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
is an example of a real day we saw
 
02:32:26.710 --> 02:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
in may of this year um there was so much
 
02:32:28.630 --> 02:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
solar on the system that the actual
 
02:32:31.190 --> 02:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
demand line was that bottom one
 
02:32:33.190 --> 02:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
it went the demand went lower in the
 
02:32:35.270 --> 02:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
late afternoon than it had in the middle
 
02:32:36.070 --> 02:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
of the night
 
02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
and this is a new trend we've just
 
02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
started to see in the past couple years
 
02:32:41.750 --> 02:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
um demand had never gone lower than the
 
02:32:43.030 --> 02:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
middle of the night
 
02:32:46.710 --> 02:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
before this and then there's also a
 
02:32:49.429 --> 02:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
steeper ramp you see into that similar
 
02:32:50.389 --> 02:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
peak that will
 
02:32:53.270 --> 02:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
happen now later in the evening um and
 
02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
so as the sun goes down
 
02:32:57.750 --> 02:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
we need to bring other resources online
 
02:32:59.830 --> 02:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
to still keep up with that um
 
02:33:02.230 --> 02:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
demand that we'll you know we'll see in
 
02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
the evening from act
 
02:33:07.510 --> 02:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
from evening activity
 
02:33:10.389 --> 02:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot that we're doing um to
 
02:33:11.510 --> 02:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
to track this
 
02:33:14.710 --> 02:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
to incorporate it into the system to
 
02:33:18.830 --> 02:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
um understand and predict in terms of
 
02:33:22.950 --> 02:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
um you know we we get very large data
 
02:33:25.270 --> 02:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
sets from real pv systems
 
02:33:27.110 --> 02:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
so we can see how they perform on
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
varying weather days
 
02:33:31.429 --> 02:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
and it just it it really helps the
 
02:33:33.429 --> 02:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
operators have a sense on how to manage
 
02:33:34.309 --> 02:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
the system
 
02:33:37.590 --> 02:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
and how we can better incorporate
 
02:33:40.790 --> 02:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
growing variable resources over time
 
02:33:43.110 --> 02:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
and still maintain a reliable electric
 
02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:46.389 align:start position:0%
and still maintain a reliable electric
system

02:33:46.389 --> 02:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:49.830 --> 02:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
um so the the third core
 
02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
um action that we take at the iso that i
 
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned at the very beginning
 
02:33:57.910 --> 02:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
now i'm turning back to is our the power
 
02:33:58.950 --> 02:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
system planning
 
02:34:01.349 --> 02:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
so we have to plan the power system we
 
02:34:02.710 --> 02:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
have to make sure
 
02:34:04.950 --> 02:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
we meet all sorts of reliability metrics
 
02:34:05.750 --> 02:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
that come from
 
02:34:08.870 --> 02:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
ferc and their entity that they call the
 
02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
northeast electric reliability council
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
that sets these standards they're
 
02:34:15.910 --> 02:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
they're the technical body um that that
 
02:34:17.750 --> 02:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
gives us these standards and enforces
 
02:34:17.760 --> 02:34:18.710 align:start position:0%
gives us these standards and enforces
them

02:34:18.710 --> 02:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:34:22.550 --> 02:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
and so we have to do a lot of studies to
 
02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:23.270 align:start position:0%
and so we have to do a lot of studies to
say

02:34:23.270 --> 02:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:34:26.150 --> 02:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
okay are there going to be as the system
 
02:34:27.190 --> 02:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
changes as
 
02:34:30.309 --> 02:34:30.319 align:start position:0%
generators retire new new ones come on
 
02:34:33.830 --> 02:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh what do we have thermal violations
 
02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
of certain lines meaning is a
 
02:34:37.830 --> 02:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
transmission line going to get
 
02:34:39.510 --> 02:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
overloaded in this area
 
02:34:41.190 --> 02:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
because we've seen a lot of growth in
 
02:34:43.590 --> 02:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
terms of businesses or homes
 
02:34:45.270 --> 02:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
and now they're bringing in a lot of
 
02:34:47.349 --> 02:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
power but they don't have enough
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
power locally to satisfy it so we look
 
02:34:52.389 --> 02:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
at all sorts of changing dynamics of the
 
02:34:52.399 --> 02:34:53.270 align:start position:0%
at all sorts of changing dynamics of the
system

02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:34:56.389 --> 02:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
um we do a lot of studies that are
 
02:34:58.309 --> 02:34:58.319 align:start position:0%
sub-regional so you know we do we have a
 
02:35:00.150 --> 02:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
study area for new hampshire where we do
 
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
needs assessments to look at the system
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
within new hampshire
 
02:35:06.070 --> 02:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
um one project that came out of that
 
02:35:06.080 --> 02:35:07.030 align:start position:0%
um one project that came out of that
process

02:35:07.030 --> 02:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh was the seacoast reliability project
 
02:35:11.990 --> 02:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
some of you might know about that um
 
02:35:13.990 --> 02:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
that was a that was a line upgrade that
 
02:35:16.389 --> 02:35:16.399 align:start position:0%
occurred in the seacoast
 
02:35:18.790 --> 02:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
um for you know there was there's a big
 
02:35:20.230 --> 02:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
load growth in certain areas of the
 
02:35:20.240 --> 02:35:21.190 align:start position:0%
load growth in certain areas of the
seacoast

02:35:21.190 --> 02:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
seacoast
 
02:35:25.830 --> 02:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
so that was part of it um and we do
 
02:35:28.950 --> 02:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
we do regional system plans
 
02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
every two years 2021
 
02:35:35.110 --> 02:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
is a regional system plan year we look
 
02:35:36.070 --> 02:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
at the system
 
02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
holistically we say okay what are we
 
02:35:40.070 --> 02:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
planning to spend
 
02:35:43.110 --> 02:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
and invest in in transmission what do we
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
think we need
 
02:35:47.110 --> 02:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
how will these costs be allocated those
 
02:35:48.469 --> 02:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
types of dynamics
 
02:35:50.630 --> 02:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
to keep the transmission system robust
 
02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
and and increasingly
 
02:35:55.590 --> 02:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
as renewables are coming into the system
 
02:35:57.750 --> 02:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
for example offshore wind we're looking
 
02:35:59.510 --> 02:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
at things like
 
02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay there if there's a lot of offshore
 
02:36:03.750 --> 02:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
winds thousands of megawatts
 
02:36:06.230 --> 02:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
and they all kind of want to come in
 
02:36:07.910 --> 02:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
onto our southeastern new england
 
02:36:09.750 --> 02:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
coastal area because that makes the most
 
02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:10.630 align:start position:0%
coastal area because that makes the most
sense

02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
sense
 
02:36:13.910 --> 02:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
do we have infrastructure locally that
 
02:36:16.070 --> 02:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
can accommodate that type of power
 
02:36:19.349 --> 02:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
flow that onshoring of power or will we
 
02:36:20.790 --> 02:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
need to build a new line
 
02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
say through the cape cod area like how
 
02:36:25.830 --> 02:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
are we going to get that power
 
02:36:28.870 --> 02:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
from a remote point to a load center
 
02:36:30.630 --> 02:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
where people need it in boston or
 
02:36:33.670 --> 02:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
connecticut or other places
 
02:36:36.870 --> 02:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
you you all know about um
 
02:36:39.990 --> 02:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
the line being proposed in
 
02:36:43.429 --> 02:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh to go through maine the nec c line
 
02:36:47.590 --> 02:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
um and that is to bring some hydroquebec
 
02:36:50.790 --> 02:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
power down through maine and um into
 
02:36:52.389 --> 02:36:52.399 align:start position:0%
southern new england that that
 
02:36:53.750 --> 02:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is
 
02:36:57.910 --> 02:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:00.630 --> 02:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
um so i went through this i'm gonna skip
 
02:37:02.150 --> 02:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
that because we're down to a couple
 
02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:03.110 align:start position:0%
that because we're down to a couple
minutes

02:37:03.110 --> 02:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
um i'll just say you can go back to this
 
02:37:07.590 --> 02:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
we've made a lot of investments in the
 
02:37:09.429 --> 02:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
new england transmission system
 
02:37:12.150 --> 02:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
we used to have a lot of congestion um
 
02:37:13.510 --> 02:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
in the early 2000s
 
02:37:15.510 --> 02:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
and that's largely been eliminated that
 
02:37:17.110 --> 02:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
helps in terms of
 
02:37:19.750 --> 02:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
costs of generation because the cheapest
 
02:37:20.790 --> 02:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
generation can
 
02:37:23.590 --> 02:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
flow where it needs to on the system to
 
02:37:24.630 --> 02:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
meet load
 
02:37:27.270 --> 02:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
even if it's farther away from that load
 
02:37:28.950 --> 02:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
um so even though you know there's a
 
02:37:30.230 --> 02:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
cost trade-off you invest in the
 
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
transmission but it may bring down
 
02:37:33.030 --> 02:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
generation costs
 
02:37:34.950 --> 02:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
um in terms of dispatching the cheapest
 
02:37:37.429 --> 02:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
possible resource
 
02:37:40.469 --> 02:37:40.479 align:start position:0%
um i just mentioned some of those costs
 
02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
how it helps beyond reliability
 
02:37:45.030 --> 02:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
um and how are these costs allocated
 
02:37:45.910 --> 02:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
because we're
 
02:37:48.550 --> 02:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
we're an integrated regional system we
 
02:37:50.630 --> 02:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
if it's part of that bulk transmission
 
02:37:52.630 --> 02:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
system we call the pool transmission
 
02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:53.910 align:start position:0%
system we call the pool transmission
facilities

02:37:53.910 --> 02:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
02:37:55.830 --> 02:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
we all pay a share of that within new
 
02:37:57.990 --> 02:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
england so even if it's a line
 
02:37:59.750 --> 02:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
that like the seacoast reliability
 
02:38:01.270 --> 02:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
project all
 
02:38:03.110 --> 02:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire only paid about nine and a
 
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
half percent of that line even though it
 
02:38:06.550 --> 02:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
was in our state because it was part of
 
02:38:07.830 --> 02:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
that bulk system
 
02:38:09.670 --> 02:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
so massachusetts for example paid about
 
02:38:11.110 --> 02:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
45 percent of that
 
02:38:13.270 --> 02:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
those these costs are allocated sort of
 
02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
based on what your
 
02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:22.870 --> 02:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
um so wrapping up you've heard me you
 
02:38:24.469 --> 02:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
know speak about this throughout
 
02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
we really are transitioning to a grid of
 
02:38:28.230 --> 02:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
the future
 
02:38:29.990 --> 02:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of very interesting
 
02:38:31.349 --> 02:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
discussions underway
 
02:38:33.030 --> 02:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
at the regional level and at the state
 
02:38:35.030 --> 02:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
levels about okay what
 
02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
what changes need to happen at the
 
02:38:39.190 --> 02:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
federal level at the iso level at the
 
02:38:40.150 --> 02:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
state level
 
02:38:43.110 --> 02:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
to help make this transition as smooth
 
02:38:45.190 --> 02:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
as possible as affordable as possible as
 
02:38:46.870 --> 02:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
reliable as possible
 
02:38:50.309 --> 02:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
um we you know do we need to look at how
 
02:38:50.319 --> 02:38:50.950 align:start position:0%
um we you know do we need to look at how
our

02:38:50.950 --> 02:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:38:52.550 --> 02:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
how the markets work how the market's
 
02:38:54.550 --> 02:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
rules work how do
 
02:38:57.270 --> 02:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
how do we do resource adequacy you know
 
02:38:57.280 --> 02:38:58.070 align:start position:0%
how do we do resource adequacy you know
um

02:38:58.070 --> 02:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
the iso is not set up to take into
 
02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:01.429 align:start position:0%
the iso is not set up to take into
account

02:39:01.429 --> 02:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
account
 
02:39:03.590 --> 02:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
into consideration environmental goals
 
02:39:05.429 --> 02:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
but a lot of states have very
 
02:39:07.270 --> 02:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
important environmental goals and
 
02:39:08.790 --> 02:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
decarbonization goals
 
02:39:11.110 --> 02:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
so maybe that original construct isn't
 
02:39:12.710 --> 02:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
serving the purposes
 
02:39:15.030 --> 02:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
that it was set up to do in the same way
 
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
and so maybe we need to take a look at
 
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
that and so there are a lot of
 
02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:18.950 align:start position:0%
that and so there are a lot of
discussions

02:39:18.950 --> 02:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
02:39:22.950 --> 02:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
you know underway in that respect
 
02:39:25.110 --> 02:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
and the iso you know is is very
 
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
cognizant of that and sensitive to it
 
02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:27.429 align:start position:0%
cognizant of that and sensitive to it
and

02:39:27.429 --> 02:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:29.750 --> 02:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know uh at our strategic planning
 
02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:30.630 align:start position:0%
you know uh at our strategic planning
level

02:39:30.630 --> 02:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
we have developed this vision statement
 
02:39:34.309 --> 02:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
about how we
 
02:39:36.550 --> 02:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
really continue to harness competitive
 
02:39:36.560 --> 02:39:37.670 align:start position:0%
really continue to harness competitive
markets

02:39:37.670 --> 02:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
markets
 
02:39:39.990 --> 02:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
and all these advanced technologies and
 
02:39:41.429 --> 02:39:41.439 align:start position:0%
be that neutral body
 
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
but to continue to reliably operate and
 
02:39:44.550 --> 02:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
plan the grid
 
02:39:46.469 --> 02:39:46.479 align:start position:0%
as the whole region transitions to clean
 
02:39:48.389 --> 02:39:48.399 align:start position:0%
energy so it's a real recognition of
 
02:39:49.030 --> 02:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
what the
 
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
majority of the region is looking to do
 
02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:52.710 align:start position:0%
majority of the region is looking to do
here

02:39:52.710 --> 02:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:39:55.270 --> 02:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
we have lots of resources endless
 
02:39:57.190 --> 02:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
resources really our website
 
02:40:01.030 --> 02:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
has has really good snapshots of what
 
02:40:02.150 --> 02:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
the system looks like
 
02:40:05.429 --> 02:40:05.439 align:start position:0%
right on our home page we have an
 
02:40:09.190 --> 02:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
app called iso to go i'll show you
 
02:40:10.870 --> 02:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
it's free you can download it you can
 
02:40:12.550 --> 02:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
see what the prices are at any given
 
02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:13.190 align:start position:0%
see what the prices are at any given
moment

02:40:13.190 --> 02:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
moment
 
02:40:14.870 --> 02:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
you can see what the demand curves look
 
02:40:18.870 --> 02:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
like as i showed you in that one chart
 
02:40:21.110 --> 02:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
i i recommend it it's a fun app it's
 
02:40:22.790 --> 02:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
very user friendly
 
02:40:25.910 --> 02:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
and we do um lots of publications we do
 
02:40:26.790 --> 02:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
an annual
 
02:40:29.990 --> 02:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh rely regional electricity outlook
 
02:40:30.950 --> 02:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's very
 
02:40:33.429 --> 02:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
visual good graphics and we do some
 
02:40:34.870 --> 02:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
state profiles so
 
02:40:37.750 --> 02:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
with that i am happy to take any
 
02:40:40.389 --> 02:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
02:40:44.070 --> 02:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mrs epson as usual a
 
02:40:44.080 --> 02:40:45.190 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mrs epson as usual a
very

02:40:45.190 --> 02:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:40:48.469 --> 02:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
thorough and interesting presentation
 
02:40:51.590 --> 02:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
i'll start off the questions for you one
 
02:40:54.030 --> 02:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
of your slides talk about 24
 
02:40:58.309 --> 02:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
129 megawatts of wind
 
02:41:01.429 --> 02:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
and i've been noticing that existing
 
02:41:04.710 --> 02:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
ppas that have been submitted
 
02:41:06.550 --> 02:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
or have been signed rather by both
 
02:41:09.590 --> 02:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and connecticut
 
02:41:12.870 --> 02:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
are showing prices for that offshore
 
02:41:12.880 --> 02:41:14.309 align:start position:0%
are showing prices for that offshore
wind

02:41:14.309 --> 02:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
wind
 
02:41:17.670 --> 02:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
between 78 and 98 dollars per
 
02:41:20.309 --> 02:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
megawatt which is considerably higher
 
02:41:20.319 --> 02:41:21.349 align:start position:0%
megawatt which is considerably higher
than

02:41:21.349 --> 02:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:41:23.590 --> 02:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
the average price of a megawatt today
 
02:41:25.670 --> 02:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
does iso new england
 
02:41:29.349 --> 02:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
forecast significant increases in the
 
02:41:31.030 --> 02:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
price of electricity over the coming
 
02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:33.429 align:start position:0%
price of electricity over the coming
years

02:41:33.429 --> 02:41:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:36.150 --> 02:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
um so just to be just to clarify so that
 
02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
the total
 
02:41:38.630 --> 02:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
interconnection queue is 24 000
 
02:41:41.510 --> 02:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
megawatts and then wind is about 15 000
 
02:41:42.469 --> 02:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
megawatts of
 
02:41:45.750 --> 02:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
that and
 
02:41:48.630 --> 02:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of those power purchase
 
02:41:50.469 --> 02:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
agreements that are being signed in
 
02:41:52.150 --> 02:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and connecticut
 
02:41:54.309 --> 02:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
and rhode island those are power
 
02:41:56.230 --> 02:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
purchase agreements being signed
 
02:41:59.429 --> 02:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
with their um retail
 
02:42:02.790 --> 02:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
ute electric utilities so those costs
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
will be born
 
02:42:07.429 --> 02:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
not at the wholesale level but at the
 
02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
um state level based on how those
 
02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
contracts are entered into
 
02:42:16.870 --> 02:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
so in terms of overall
 
02:42:20.230 --> 02:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
um forecasts
 
02:42:23.910 --> 02:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
on um electric you know wholesale market
 
02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:25.510 align:start position:0%
on um electric you know wholesale market
prices

02:42:25.510 --> 02:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
prices
 
02:42:28.550 --> 02:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
um we we aren't specifically
 
02:42:32.150 --> 02:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
expecting to see them increase
 
02:42:35.590 --> 02:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
we've seen a declining trend over time
 
02:42:37.110 --> 02:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
and generally a lot of these
 
02:42:39.110 --> 02:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
technologies that are coming online
 
02:42:40.950 --> 02:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
we're also seeing the price
 
02:42:45.910 --> 02:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:49.349 --> 02:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you next is representative
 
02:42:54.950 --> 02:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
jd bernardi
 
02:42:58.550 --> 02:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
done mute here uh yeah so uh with regard
 
02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
to reliability
 
02:43:03.590 --> 02:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh what do you have any involvement
 
02:43:07.670 --> 02:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
in uh hardening the grid for emp
 
02:43:10.710 --> 02:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
or is that off your uh responsibility
 
02:43:10.720 --> 02:43:12.469 align:start position:0%
or is that off your uh responsibility
list

02:43:12.469 --> 02:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
list
 
02:43:16.550 --> 02:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
we are aware of that issue very much um
 
02:43:19.670 --> 02:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
you know there are a lot of security and
 
02:43:23.190 --> 02:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
reliability risks that we analyze
 
02:43:26.309 --> 02:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
um so yes that does fall under
 
02:43:30.469 --> 02:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
our purview a lot of cyber security
 
02:43:32.230 --> 02:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
risks now too that are being looked at
 
02:43:34.389 --> 02:43:34.399 align:start position:0%
the iso is increasingly you know has an
 
02:43:37.269 --> 02:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
increasingly large cyber security team
 
02:43:40.550 --> 02:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:54.710 --> 02:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:56.710 --> 02:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
don't forget to unmute say all that
 
02:43:57.750 --> 02:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
again now
 
02:44:00.070 --> 02:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman rose and thank you
 
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
kate for an excellent presentation
 
02:44:05.670 --> 02:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
very helpful for some context um
 
02:44:09.590 --> 02:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
and the changing is is of interest to me
 
02:44:11.269 --> 02:44:11.279 align:start position:0%
in how we're approaching our work this
 
02:44:14.150 --> 02:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
year um net metering efforts and several
 
02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:14.710 align:start position:0%
year um net metering efforts and several
different

02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:44:16.630 --> 02:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
bills are coming up uh this year again
 
02:44:18.150 --> 02:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
in the legislature
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
and i understand that in december the
 
02:44:23.030 --> 02:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
iso came out
 
02:44:26.550 --> 02:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
to discuss the um
 
02:44:29.590 --> 02:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
the categorization i guess of behind the
 
02:44:30.630 --> 02:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
meter assets
 
02:44:33.510 --> 02:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
which we can't really see and use in
 
02:44:34.389 --> 02:44:34.399 align:start position:0%
terms of our
 
02:44:40.070 --> 02:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
overall energy landscape but we can
 
02:44:41.830 --> 02:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
figure out whether to designate them as
 
02:44:43.429 --> 02:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
load reducers and you mentioned in your
 
02:44:43.439 --> 02:44:44.469 align:start position:0%
load reducers and you mentioned in your
presentation

02:44:44.469 --> 02:44:44.479 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
02:44:46.469 --> 02:44:46.479 align:start position:0%
that that was how you look at those
 
02:44:46.479 --> 02:44:47.910 align:start position:0%
that that was how you look at those
assets

02:44:47.910 --> 02:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
assets
 
02:44:49.830 --> 02:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
so it may inform some of our
 
02:44:51.910 --> 02:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
conversations later in the session
 
02:44:53.349 --> 02:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
if you could just say something about
 
02:44:55.750 --> 02:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
that december discussion and decision
 
02:44:57.670 --> 02:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
at the iso because i think it was kind
 
02:44:59.590 --> 02:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
of a nebulous area for us in the last
 
02:45:01.110 --> 02:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
session when we discussed how those
 
02:45:02.230 --> 02:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
assets are looked at
 
02:45:03.590 --> 02:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of what they're doing for the
 
02:45:05.670 --> 02:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
system sure
 
02:45:08.150 --> 02:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
so there are a couple components so when
 
02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
we operate the system we often see them
 
02:45:10.319 --> 02:45:10.950 align:start position:0%
we operate the system we often see them
as

02:45:10.950 --> 02:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:45:12.950 --> 02:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
load reduction but i think the issue
 
02:45:15.429 --> 02:45:15.439 align:start position:0%
that you're specifically referring to
 
02:45:18.309 --> 02:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
is that of reconstituting behind the
 
02:45:18.319 --> 02:45:19.030 align:start position:0%
is that of reconstituting behind the
meter

02:45:19.030 --> 02:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
meter
 
02:45:22.469 --> 02:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
generation into regional network load
 
02:45:23.750 --> 02:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
which is a trans
 
02:45:26.790 --> 02:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's a transmission metric in the
 
02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
transmission system rather than the
 
02:45:31.830 --> 02:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
looking at the generation um part of the
 
02:45:33.030 --> 02:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
system so
 
02:45:35.590 --> 02:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
the our independent market monitor came
 
02:45:36.150 --> 02:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
out with
 
02:45:39.510 --> 02:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
a report this summer and they said
 
02:45:42.070 --> 02:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
we think there may be a compliance issue
 
02:45:42.950 --> 02:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
where the
 
02:45:45.990 --> 02:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
transmission owners are
 
02:45:49.030 --> 02:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
not reconstituting the load
 
02:45:51.349 --> 02:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
of the behind the meter generation into
 
02:45:53.670 --> 02:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
this regional network load
 
02:45:57.670 --> 02:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
and subsequently the transmission owners
 
02:46:00.710 --> 02:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
put together a proposal to reconcile and
 
02:46:02.070 --> 02:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
fix that compliance
 
02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
issue and so that is actually
 
02:46:08.950 --> 02:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
in process right now in our stakeholder
 
02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:10.230 align:start position:0%
in process right now in our stakeholder
process

02:46:10.230 --> 02:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:46:14.070 --> 02:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
and they're looking at okay
 
02:46:16.469 --> 02:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
apparently their practice has generally
 
02:46:16.479 --> 02:46:17.269 align:start position:0%
apparently their practice has generally
been

02:46:17.269 --> 02:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:46:19.990 --> 02:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
to not reconstitute the load and treat
 
02:46:21.670 --> 02:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
them as load reducers
 
02:46:24.469 --> 02:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
and they would like to continue to do
 
02:46:24.479 --> 02:46:24.790 align:start position:0%
and they would like to continue to do
that

02:46:24.790 --> 02:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
so they're looking to modify the tariff
 
02:46:28.950 --> 02:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
to reflect that practice
 
02:46:31.429 --> 02:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
but that's um that is still under
 
02:46:33.349 --> 02:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
discussion at the stakeholder process
 
02:46:35.910 --> 02:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
there's been no official filing at ferc
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
to make those changes um
 
02:46:40.469 --> 02:46:40.479 align:start position:0%
but is that what you were referring to
 
02:46:41.830 --> 02:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
yes yeah
 
02:46:44.950 --> 02:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
okay yeah because i think that
 
02:46:47.349 --> 02:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
that's opaque to us right now yeah it's
 
02:46:49.269 --> 02:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
very it's very technical
 
02:46:51.510 --> 02:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
and it has implications mostly on kind
 
02:46:52.469 --> 02:46:52.479 align:start position:0%
of um
 
02:46:55.030 --> 02:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
how costs are allocated and you know
 
02:46:56.230 --> 02:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
what are the benefits
 
02:46:58.309 --> 02:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
what are the costs if we're reducing
 
02:47:00.070 --> 02:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
those monthly peaks
 
02:47:03.349 --> 02:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
um how should we you know how do we take
 
02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
that into account in the system so
 
02:47:06.389 --> 02:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
that's what the transmission owners are
 
02:47:08.309 --> 02:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
looking at really
 
02:47:10.790 --> 02:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
more than the iso itself since they
 
02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:11.349 align:start position:0%
more than the iso itself since they
they're

02:47:11.349 --> 02:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:47:14.070 --> 02:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
they own the assets they really um have
 
02:47:15.269 --> 02:47:15.279 align:start position:0%
all the data
 
02:47:18.469 --> 02:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
um and so that's ongoing and i'm you
 
02:47:19.990 --> 02:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
know i'm happy to continue to update
 
02:47:21.429 --> 02:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
folks on that because that's going to go
 
02:47:24.070 --> 02:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
on for the next few months i would say
 
02:47:27.110 --> 02:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you okay uh
 
02:47:32.950 --> 02:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:36.309 --> 02:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman vos uh
 
02:47:39.910 --> 02:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
ms um epson i have a question on the
 
02:47:46.830 --> 02:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:49.030 --> 02:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
and is the
 
02:47:53.349 --> 02:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
um you have the dotted line
 
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
which is the the peak power demand
 
02:48:00.790 --> 02:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
and the solid line on the bottom
 
02:48:04.150 --> 02:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
02:48:07.510 --> 02:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
with the use of solar behind the meter
 
02:48:08.070 --> 02:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
or just
 
02:48:11.590 --> 02:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
all solar um
 
02:48:13.590 --> 02:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
so yeah let me clarify it's a good
 
02:48:16.150 --> 02:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
question so the dotted line at the top
 
02:48:19.670 --> 02:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
is what the demand would have been
 
02:48:22.710 --> 02:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
absent behind the meter solar but the
 
02:48:24.710 --> 02:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
bottom line is what we actually
 
02:48:27.750 --> 02:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
saw as demand because
 
02:48:30.070 --> 02:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
the there was so much solar on the
 
02:48:32.790 --> 02:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
system reducing that demand
 
02:48:37.110 --> 02:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
all right and a follow-up question um
 
02:48:40.150 --> 02:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
right now i mean battery development has
 
02:48:43.349 --> 02:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
become such a big thing for behind the
 
02:48:43.359 --> 02:48:44.230 align:start position:0%
become such a big thing for behind the
meter

02:48:44.230 --> 02:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
meter
 
02:48:47.510 --> 02:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
it seems to be growing exponentially
 
02:48:50.790 --> 02:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
is is there any anticipation of
 
02:48:52.550 --> 02:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh what that's going to do to peak
 
02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:53.990 align:start position:0%
uh what that's going to do to peak
demand

02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
demand
 
02:48:59.030 --> 02:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh at the end after the sun sets
 
02:49:01.590 --> 02:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
i mean i think that the idea and the
 
02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
hopes are generally i'm just generally
 
02:49:04.790 --> 02:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
speaking you know for
 
02:49:07.030 --> 02:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
you know what we're seeing in kind of
 
02:49:09.030 --> 02:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
technology innovation is that
 
02:49:11.750 --> 02:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
the that storage can that is paired with
 
02:49:13.349 --> 02:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
solar or standalone
 
02:49:15.429 --> 02:49:15.439 align:start position:0%
can help with that ramp that solid line
 
02:49:16.389 --> 02:49:16.399 align:start position:0%
we see
 
02:49:19.110 --> 02:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
and help bring down that evening peak as
 
02:49:20.790 --> 02:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
the solar comes offline
 
02:49:22.309 --> 02:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
so that it wouldn't the system wouldn't
 
02:49:23.910 --> 02:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
be as reliant on other
 
02:49:25.910 --> 02:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
say natural gas resources or other
 
02:49:28.150 --> 02:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel resources that can
 
02:49:31.269 --> 02:49:31.279 align:start position:0%
um dispatch quickly and ramp up
 
02:49:34.389 --> 02:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
to accommodate that demand that is
 
02:49:36.870 --> 02:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
you know coming back online as the solar
 
02:49:38.070 --> 02:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
tails off so
 
02:49:40.150 --> 02:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
um i you know i just read an article for
 
02:49:42.469 --> 02:49:42.479 align:start position:0%
example this morning that said
 
02:49:45.030 --> 02:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
about two-thirds of solar now come
 
02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
proposing to come into the system
 
02:49:49.590 --> 02:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
um you know nationwide is being paired
 
02:49:50.389 --> 02:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
with storage
 
02:49:53.190 --> 02:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
so it looks like you know people are
 
02:49:55.269 --> 02:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
understanding this dynamic here shown in
 
02:49:56.230 --> 02:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
this chart and
 
02:49:58.630 --> 02:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
and it it looks like that there you know
 
02:50:00.070 --> 02:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
there's going to be
 
02:50:02.469 --> 02:50:02.479 align:start position:0%
uh these dual assets and these paired
 
02:50:04.150 --> 02:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
assets increasingly to help kind of
 
02:50:07.670 --> 02:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
manage those ramps and those peaks
 
02:50:10.790 --> 02:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
02:50:13.190 --> 02:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
next up and don't forget to unmute
 
02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:13.830 align:start position:0%
next up and don't forget to unmute
yourself

02:50:13.830 --> 02:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
02:50:17.110 --> 02:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative samsich
 
02:50:19.910 --> 02:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you mr chairman mr chairman
 
02:50:20.469 --> 02:50:20.479 align:start position:0%
i have
 
02:50:23.910 --> 02:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
two two questions for miss epson uh
 
02:50:27.830 --> 02:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's epson uh the simpler question is um
 
02:50:30.870 --> 02:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
i noticed from your diagrams that it
 
02:50:30.880 --> 02:50:31.269 align:start position:0%
i noticed from your diagrams that it
looks

02:50:31.269 --> 02:50:31.279 align:start position:0%
looks
 
02:50:33.510 --> 02:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
as far as the future predictions are
 
02:50:33.520 --> 02:50:34.550 align:start position:0%
as far as the future predictions are
concerned

02:50:34.550 --> 02:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
02:50:37.910 --> 02:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
that energy efficiency makes a big dent
 
02:50:41.670 --> 02:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
in in energy uh energy demand
 
02:50:45.110 --> 02:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
resulting in energy demand so that's my
 
02:50:47.110 --> 02:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
first question my second question is a
 
02:50:48.630 --> 02:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
02:50:51.429 --> 02:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
regarding the power system planning and
 
02:50:53.510 --> 02:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
that is i've heard a number of people
 
02:50:54.950 --> 02:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
discussing the idea
 
02:50:58.230 --> 02:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
of of perhaps implementing
 
02:51:01.830 --> 02:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
as a national infrastructure project
 
02:51:05.750 --> 02:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
a separate additional grid
 
02:51:09.830 --> 02:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
a transmission grid for renewable energy
 
02:51:12.469 --> 02:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
similar to the national highway system
 
02:51:13.990 --> 02:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
which would be complementing
 
02:51:16.070 --> 02:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
the current grid have you heard any of
 
02:51:18.630 --> 02:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
that discussion
 
02:51:21.030 --> 02:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
so on your first point yes um energy
 
02:51:22.550 --> 02:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
efficiency is making
 
02:51:25.590 --> 02:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
um a big difference in in energy
 
02:51:27.830 --> 02:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
and peak demand if that if that was your
 
02:51:27.840 --> 02:51:29.269 align:start position:0%
and peak demand if that if that was your
question

02:51:29.269 --> 02:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:51:33.510 --> 02:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
yes that's true um i so
 
02:51:36.710 --> 02:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
i have read in the press too that
 
02:51:39.910 --> 02:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of discussions underway
 
02:51:44.830 --> 02:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
about a you know a federally
 
02:51:48.230 --> 02:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
um proposed type of
 
02:51:51.510 --> 02:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
interstate transmission system as well
 
02:51:54.630 --> 02:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of moving
 
02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
renewables say like wind from the
 
02:51:56.640 --> 02:51:57.670 align:start position:0%
renewables say like wind from the
midwest

02:51:57.670 --> 02:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
midwest
 
02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
to the east and there are a lot of
 
02:52:03.269 --> 02:52:03.279 align:start position:0%
reports that actually look at that
 
02:52:06.710 --> 02:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
and there was a very recent report i
 
02:52:08.070 --> 02:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
think that looked at that
 
02:52:10.230 --> 02:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's not an iso report it's a it's a
 
02:52:11.349 --> 02:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
consulting report
 
02:52:14.469 --> 02:52:14.479 align:start position:0%
that looks at the cost differential
 
02:52:18.469 --> 02:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
of doing um meeting clean energy goals
 
02:52:20.389 --> 02:52:20.399 align:start position:0%
if they're federally coordinated
 
02:52:23.429 --> 02:52:23.439 align:start position:0%
versus state by state by state and the
 
02:52:24.630 --> 02:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
efficiencies you'd see
 
02:52:26.950 --> 02:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
and kind of having that organized
 
02:52:28.070 --> 02:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
transmission system
 
02:52:30.550 --> 02:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
rather than kind of a one-off built
 
02:52:32.309 --> 02:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
transmission system so yeah there's
 
02:52:34.309 --> 02:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that's under discussion i
 
02:52:35.830 --> 02:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
would say nationally
 
02:52:39.030 --> 02:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
about how how are we going to
 
02:52:40.550 --> 02:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
interconnect renewables
 
02:52:42.309 --> 02:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
and how are we going to maybe move them
 
02:52:45.269 --> 02:52:45.279 align:start position:0%
around in a way that helps
 
02:52:47.030 --> 02:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
mitigate some of the variability by
 
02:52:47.040 --> 02:52:48.389 align:start position:0%
mitigate some of the variability by
region

02:52:48.389 --> 02:52:48.399 align:start position:0%
region
 
02:52:51.750 --> 02:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
02:52:54.550 --> 02:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
representatives samsung pimentel if you
 
02:52:54.560 --> 02:52:54.870 align:start position:0%
representatives samsung pimentel if you
could

02:52:54.870 --> 02:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:52:56.389 --> 02:52:56.399 align:start position:0%
lower your hands now that you've asked
 
02:52:59.750 --> 02:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
your questions and next i'll call on
 
02:53:03.670 --> 02:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative uh homoa
 
02:53:04.870 --> 02:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so much for your
 
02:53:07.110 --> 02:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
presentation and for giving us this
 
02:53:08.150 --> 02:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
information today
 
02:53:11.269 --> 02:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
the question i had was do you have any
 
02:53:12.710 --> 02:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
information on the overall
 
02:53:16.550 --> 02:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
cost of utilities in states say like
 
02:53:18.550 --> 02:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
vermont who have very aggressive
 
02:53:20.070 --> 02:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
renewable policies
 
02:53:22.389 --> 02:53:22.399 align:start position:0%
how has that benefited the consumer
 
02:53:25.269 --> 02:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
02:53:29.030 --> 02:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
sure um we we do keep track
 
02:53:32.950 --> 02:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
of the differences in retail electrical
 
02:53:32.960 --> 02:53:33.429 align:start position:0%
of the differences in retail electrical
rates

02:53:33.429 --> 02:53:33.439 align:start position:0%
rates
 
02:53:34.950 --> 02:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
in each of our states mostly for
 
02:53:36.469 --> 02:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
educational purposes
 
02:53:40.230 --> 02:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
and as part of um another group that we
 
02:53:42.230 --> 02:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
coordinate called the consumer liaison
 
02:53:43.590 --> 02:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
group um
 
02:53:46.630 --> 02:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
and so i'm i'm not i i do have an
 
02:53:49.830 --> 02:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
appendix with me today so if you don't
 
02:53:50.870 --> 02:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
if you want to
 
02:53:53.269 --> 02:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
not look while i scroll really quickly
 
02:53:53.279 --> 02:53:54.309 align:start position:0%
not look while i scroll really quickly
but

02:53:54.309 --> 02:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:53:56.790 --> 02:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
we do have the comparison of retail
 
02:53:58.630 --> 02:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
rates by the states and
 
02:54:00.710 --> 02:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
so we don't i don't necessarily want to
 
02:54:02.630 --> 02:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
attribute it to this policy or that
 
02:54:02.640 --> 02:54:03.510 align:start position:0%
attribute it to this policy or that
policy

02:54:03.510 --> 02:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
um and it looks like we i don't have
 
02:54:07.510 --> 02:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
that slide in here
 
02:54:09.670 --> 02:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
but i do have that information that
 
02:54:09.680 --> 02:54:10.550 align:start position:0%
but i do have that information that
slide

02:54:10.550 --> 02:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
slide
 
02:54:12.710 --> 02:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
and i can get that to you and what i
 
02:54:15.990 --> 02:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
will say off the top of my head is
 
02:54:19.429 --> 02:54:19.439 align:start position:0%
um i believe vermont has slightly lower
 
02:54:19.439 --> 02:54:20.550 align:start position:0%
um i believe vermont has slightly lower
rates

02:54:20.550 --> 02:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
rates
 
02:54:22.309 --> 02:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
now something to keep in mind is they're
 
02:54:24.150 --> 02:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
not they did not restructure
 
02:54:27.910 --> 02:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
so their utilities um are bundled still
 
02:54:30.230 --> 02:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
they own the generation the transmission
 
02:54:31.990 --> 02:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
and the distribution so that's just one
 
02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:32.550 align:start position:0%
and the distribution so that's just one
factor

02:54:32.550 --> 02:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
factor
 
02:54:35.190 --> 02:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
to consider though they they do have
 
02:54:37.429 --> 02:54:37.439 align:start position:0%
aggressive policies
 
02:54:40.550 --> 02:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
and i think new hampshire is
 
02:54:43.429 --> 02:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
about the in the middle like we have the
 
02:54:43.439 --> 02:54:44.550 align:start position:0%
about the in the middle like we have the
fourth

02:54:44.550 --> 02:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
fourth
 
02:54:47.590 --> 02:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
highest retail electric rates but in
 
02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:47.990 align:start position:0%
highest retail electric rates but in
another

02:54:47.990 --> 02:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:54:50.710 --> 02:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
sense the third lowest so you know it's
 
02:54:52.150 --> 02:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
we're kind of in the middle
 
02:54:53.670 --> 02:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
connecticut and massachusetts have the
 
02:54:56.150 --> 02:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
higher retail electric rates
 
02:55:00.630 --> 02:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
of the region thank you
 
02:55:03.830 --> 02:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much and uh
 
02:55:06.870 --> 02:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you sue i mean uh kate epson for
 
02:55:09.429 --> 02:55:09.439 align:start position:0%
uh your presentation here today we're
 
02:55:10.389 --> 02:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
just about
 
02:55:13.750 --> 02:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
out of time uh for our zoom
 
02:55:16.710 --> 02:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
session here and i would like to close
 
02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:17.030 align:start position:0%
session here and i would like to close
this

02:55:17.030 --> 02:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:55:20.230 --> 02:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh meeting by reminding members that uh
 
02:55:21.990 --> 02:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
we will have another one of these
 
02:55:25.030 --> 02:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
presentations next friday starting at 10
 
02:55:26.150 --> 02:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
a.m it'll be
 
02:55:28.309 --> 02:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
very similar to the one we're having
 
02:55:29.429 --> 02:55:29.439 align:start position:0%
here today
 
02:55:32.790 --> 02:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
i urge you to be here if you can
 
02:55:34.870 --> 02:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure most of you are wondering
 
02:55:35.990 --> 02:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
when will we have
 
02:55:39.510 --> 02:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
our first public hearing well
 
02:55:41.590 --> 02:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
we don't know the exact answer to that
 
02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:42.630 align:start position:0%
we don't know the exact answer to that
question

02:55:42.630 --> 02:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:55:45.349 --> 02:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
but we do know it will be no earlier
 
02:55:45.359 --> 02:55:46.070 align:start position:0%
but we do know it will be no earlier
than

02:55:46.070 --> 02:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:55:49.429 --> 02:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
january 25th the week of january 25th as
 
02:55:49.439 --> 02:55:50.309 align:start position:0%
january 25th the week of january 25th as
being

02:55:50.309 --> 02:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:55:53.990 --> 02:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh we're being told is when
 
02:55:55.750 --> 02:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of public hearings
 
02:55:57.030 --> 02:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
will begin
 
02:55:59.030 --> 02:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
there will be a couple of public
 
02:56:00.710 --> 02:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
hearings next
 
02:56:03.830 --> 02:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
week but those public hearings
 
02:56:06.710 --> 02:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
are considered to be trial hearings to
 
02:56:06.720 --> 02:56:07.750 align:start position:0%
are considered to be trial hearings to
test

02:56:07.750 --> 02:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
test
 
02:56:10.790 --> 02:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
the systems that have been set up by the
 
02:56:13.030 --> 02:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
house staff and the house leadership
 
02:56:16.790 --> 02:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh to get public hearings going
 
02:56:19.269 --> 02:56:19.279 align:start position:0%
the hybrid model public hearings uh
 
02:56:20.630 --> 02:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
started and
 
02:56:23.190 --> 02:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
you know iron out the kinks so there
 
02:56:25.110 --> 02:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
will be a couple scheduled next week but
 
02:56:25.990 --> 02:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
we won't be allowed
 
02:56:27.910 --> 02:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
to schedule our first public hearings
 
02:56:29.110 --> 02:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
until the week
 
02:56:32.550 --> 02:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
of january 25th so
 
02:56:34.710 --> 02:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
it's possible that it could be that day
 
02:56:35.910 --> 02:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
monday the 25th
 
02:56:38.469 --> 02:56:38.479 align:start position:0%
depends on what day we're assigned and
 
02:56:39.990 --> 02:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
we won't know that uh
 
02:56:43.990 --> 02:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
for a while yet i don't expect to get an
 
02:56:45.910 --> 02:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
answer to that today
 
02:56:48.630 --> 02:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
so it's likely we won't know the answer
 
02:56:49.030 --> 02:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:56:52.230 --> 02:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
until sometime next week obviously we
 
02:56:53.110 --> 02:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
need to
 
02:56:55.510 --> 02:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
have an answer by next wednesday because
 
02:56:56.309 --> 02:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
that's when
 
02:56:58.550 --> 02:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
notices need to go into the calendar for
 
02:57:00.070 --> 02:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
the following week
 
02:57:01.830 --> 02:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
so it's likely we'll know by next
 
02:57:04.389 --> 02:57:04.399 align:start position:0%
wednesday possibly sooner than that
 
02:57:07.349 --> 02:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
as soon as i know i will let all of you
 
02:57:07.359 --> 02:57:08.950 align:start position:0%
as soon as i know i will let all of you
know

02:57:08.950 --> 02:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:57:10.790 --> 02:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative oxenoum you have a
 
02:57:10.800 --> 02:57:11.990 align:start position:0%
representative oxenoum you have a
question

02:57:11.990 --> 02:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:57:14.389 --> 02:57:14.399 align:start position:0%
i do mr chair thank you very much for uh
 
02:57:15.670 --> 02:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
02:57:18.630 --> 02:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's actually sort of a plea if if you
 
02:57:21.030 --> 02:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
are in negotiations about what day
 
02:57:23.510 --> 02:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
if you could please not make it monday
 
02:57:26.230 --> 02:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
january 25th that's a puc technical
 
02:57:26.240 --> 02:57:26.950 align:start position:0%
january 25th that's a puc technical
session

02:57:26.950 --> 02:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:57:29.269 --> 02:57:29.279 align:start position:0%
on energy storage and i will be very
 
02:57:31.190 --> 02:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
much bound up in and i would hate to
 
02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:31.910 align:start position:0%
much bound up in and i would hate to
miss

02:57:31.910 --> 02:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
miss
 
02:57:34.790 --> 02:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
or be put into the front situation of
 
02:57:35.990 --> 02:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
trying to be in both places
 
02:57:39.269 --> 02:57:39.279 align:start position:0%
at the same time okay i'm not
 
02:57:42.469 --> 02:57:42.479 align:start position:0%
sure that that's a good negotiation
 
02:57:45.590 --> 02:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
we may be assigned a day
 
02:57:48.550 --> 02:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
but if i have a chance to to advocate
 
02:57:50.070 --> 02:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
for one day or another i will
 
02:57:52.070 --> 02:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
i will keep that in mind thank you very

02:57:57.830 --> 02:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts don't forget
 
02:58:00.710 --> 02:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
to unmute yourself
 
02:58:03.830 --> 02:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
get everything is it is it possible that
 
02:58:03.840 --> 02:58:04.150 align:start position:0%
get everything is it is it possible that
we

02:58:04.150 --> 02:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:58:07.349 --> 02:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
as an st e committee can have
 
02:58:10.630 --> 02:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
either a web page or so that
 
02:58:12.630 --> 02:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
all our information all these
 
02:58:12.640 --> 02:58:14.389 align:start position:0%
all our information all these
presentations

02:58:14.389 --> 02:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
presentations
 
02:58:17.030 --> 02:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
copies of bills and everything can be in
 
02:58:18.790 --> 02:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
the same place
 
02:58:21.190 --> 02:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
rather than having to go into our
 
02:58:22.790 --> 02:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
personal emails or
 
02:58:26.309 --> 02:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
how to skeletal looking for them um
 
02:58:29.670 --> 02:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
just thought an excellent suggestion
 
02:58:32.790 --> 02:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
let me ask jen for
 
02:58:34.870 --> 02:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
if that's uh something that might be
 
02:58:37.670 --> 02:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
possible jen
 
02:58:41.590 --> 02:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i'm not sure about
 
02:58:44.469 --> 02:58:44.479 align:start position:0%
like a separate web page um i would say
 
02:58:46.309 --> 02:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
that the committee webpage that exists
 
02:58:46.319 --> 02:58:46.630 align:start position:0%
that the committee webpage that exists
now

02:58:46.630 --> 02:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:58:49.510 --> 02:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
is a great place to go um if you want to
 
02:58:49.520 --> 02:58:50.070 align:start position:0%
is a great place to go um if you want to
locate

02:58:50.070 --> 02:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
locate
 
02:58:52.790 --> 02:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
bills currently in committee you can go
 
02:58:53.269 --> 02:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:58:56.550 --> 02:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
um standing committee page and then
 
02:58:56.560 --> 02:58:57.030 align:start position:0%
um standing committee page and then
select

02:58:57.030 --> 02:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
select
 
02:58:59.670 --> 02:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy and then
 
02:59:01.110 --> 02:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
there's a button that says
 
02:59:03.190 --> 02:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
bill's currently in committee so that's
 
02:59:05.349 --> 02:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
helpful in that respect
 
02:59:08.550 --> 02:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of other materials that's
 
02:59:10.550 --> 02:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
definitely something that our staff
 
02:59:13.110 --> 02:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
is thinking about and asking about but
 
02:59:14.389 --> 02:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
02:59:16.950 --> 02:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
how long it would take to develop so
 
02:59:18.150 --> 02:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
stay tuned
 
02:59:20.630 --> 02:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
um we're definitely on the same page as
 
02:59:21.510 --> 02:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
as you guys
 
02:59:24.870 --> 02:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
um but of course as always limited
 
02:59:27.670 --> 02:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
time and resources to build that sort of
 
02:59:27.680 --> 02:59:29.510 align:start position:0%
time and resources to build that sort of
infrastructure

02:59:29.510 --> 02:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
02:59:32.630 --> 02:59:32.640 align:start position:0%

03:00:00.710 --> 03:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
this question is really for jen really
 
03:00:04.710 --> 03:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
actually for the benefit of of our clerk
 
03:00:07.910 --> 03:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
um what is the status of our committee
 
03:00:07.920 --> 03:00:08.950 align:start position:0%
um what is the status of our committee
assistant

03:00:08.950 --> 03:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
03:00:11.190 --> 03:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
and how is that going to work with our
 
03:00:15.349 --> 03:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:16.870 --> 03:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
there will be committee assistance
 
03:00:19.269 --> 03:00:19.279 align:start position:0%
assigned to each committee um
 
03:00:22.309 --> 03:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
as usual i'm not sure who your committee
 
03:00:24.469 --> 03:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
assistant was in the past
 
03:00:28.070 --> 03:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
it was carol stapler okay um i'm not
 
03:00:28.080 --> 03:00:28.469 align:start position:0%
it was carol stapler okay um i'm not
sure

03:00:28.469 --> 03:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:00:30.790 --> 03:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
that she will be back um but there will
 
03:00:31.990 --> 03:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
be coverage i've seen
 
03:00:34.790 --> 03:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
a draft uh model but i don't want to say
 
03:00:36.550 --> 03:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
any names until we're for sure
 
03:00:37.990 --> 03:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
but you definitely will have a committee
 
03:00:39.750 --> 03:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
assistant assigned to the committee who
 
03:00:39.760 --> 03:00:40.550 align:start position:0%
assistant assigned to the committee who
can

03:00:40.550 --> 03:00:40.560 align:start position:0%

03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
help processing bills and coordinating
 
03:00:44.710 --> 03:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
with the clerk
 
03:00:48.150 --> 03:00:48.160 align:start position:0%

on with
 
03:00:58.950 --> 03:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
um representative kelly pitt's point
 
03:01:02.150 --> 03:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if our current if our
 
03:01:04.150 --> 03:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
existing page might be the place where
 
03:01:06.309 --> 03:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
something could be added on
 
03:01:08.870 --> 03:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
also for the public in terms of where
 
03:01:09.590 --> 03:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
they would go
 
03:01:12.710 --> 03:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
to locate not only information about
 
03:01:15.269 --> 03:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
upcoming bills but also how they would
 
03:01:16.230 --> 03:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
interact with us
 
03:01:18.230 --> 03:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
because i think the question that's out
 
03:01:19.510 --> 03:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
there for them is
 
03:01:21.990 --> 03:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
how do they make people aware that
 
03:01:24.550 --> 03:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
they're planning to testify
 
03:01:26.630 --> 03:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
do they use the committee email to
 
03:01:28.630 --> 03:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
submit their testimony so there needs to
 
03:01:30.389 --> 03:01:30.399 align:start position:0%
be some answers around
 
03:01:32.309 --> 03:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
the public process i guess and that's
 
03:01:34.389 --> 03:01:34.399 align:start position:0%
the last thing i would bring up on
 
03:01:37.670 --> 03:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
on that we hadn't covered i thought
 
03:01:40.710 --> 03:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
a good point uh there's a lot
 
03:01:42.950 --> 03:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
of questions i'm sure that you guys have
 
03:01:42.960 --> 03:01:44.230 align:start position:0%
of questions i'm sure that you guys have
and

03:01:44.230 --> 03:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:01:46.790 --> 03:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
we're all in the same boat i have
 
03:01:48.150 --> 03:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
similar questions
 
03:01:51.349 --> 03:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh there are no answers yet but i'm told
 
03:01:51.359 --> 03:01:52.070 align:start position:0%
uh there are no answers yet but i'm told
that

03:01:52.070 --> 03:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:01:53.670 --> 03:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
answers to those questions are under
 
03:01:53.680 --> 03:01:55.190 align:start position:0%
answers to those questions are under
development

03:01:55.190 --> 03:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
development
 
03:01:58.070 --> 03:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
as far as a website is concerned that's
 
03:01:58.710 --> 03:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
a resource
 
03:02:01.269 --> 03:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
issue you know who would be the person
 
03:02:04.710 --> 03:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
in that would own that website
 
03:02:06.870 --> 03:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that how staff has the
 
03:02:10.389 --> 03:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
resources to do that kind of work
 
03:02:13.269 --> 03:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
i suspect with joel anderson's departure
 
03:02:15.670 --> 03:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
how staff
 
03:02:18.150 --> 03:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
is under resourced at the moment
 
03:02:19.429 --> 03:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
jennifer you could
 
03:02:23.110 --> 03:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh nod or shake your head
 
03:02:26.469 --> 03:02:26.479 align:start position:0%
if that's the case um yeah i thought so
 
03:02:26.479 --> 03:02:26.950 align:start position:0%
if that's the case um yeah i thought so
so

03:02:26.950 --> 03:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:02:30.070 --> 03:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh it would be a nice to have
 
03:02:33.110 --> 03:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
i'd love to have it myself um
 
03:02:36.550 --> 03:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
i i just don't know who we could get to
 
03:02:40.950 --> 03:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
operate uh that particular website so
 
03:02:43.110 --> 03:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's worth looking into i will pursue it
 
03:02:44.150 --> 03:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
but i can't
 
03:02:47.750 --> 03:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
obviously make any promises about it
 
03:02:49.990 --> 03:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
alrighty it's been a wonderful meeting
 
03:02:51.269 --> 03:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
it's been great to see
 
03:02:53.429 --> 03:02:53.439 align:start position:0%
everyone i'm sorry we didn't get a
 
03:02:55.510 --> 03:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
chance to do introductions we will
 
03:02:57.269 --> 03:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
make it a priority to do that next
