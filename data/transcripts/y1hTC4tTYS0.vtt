00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
there's a bill that we haven't
 
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:32.469 align:start position:0%
there's a bill that we haven't
co-sponsored

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open up the public hearing on
 
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
senate bill 202 and hear from the prime
 
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor senator waters good morning
 
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
senator waters
 
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr mr chairman members of the
 
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
committee it's good to see you all i'm
 
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
senator david waters district four here
 
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
to introduce senate bill
 
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
202 particular sale cosmetic
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
products tested on animals um
 
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
the heart of this bill i'll just get
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
right to that is uh on the first page
 
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
when it states that no manufacturer
 
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
should sell or offer for sale in this
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
state any cosmetic if such cosmetic was
 
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
developed or manufactured using cosmetic
 
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
animal testing that was conducted or
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
contracted for by the manufacturer or
 
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
any supplier of the manufacturer so the
 
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill is
 
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
is pretty clear that with the
 
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate definitions and with
 
00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
exceptions as noted throughout the bill
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
that we want new hampshire consumers to
 
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
know that when they purchase a cosmetic
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
product that it has not been produced
 
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
through animal
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
cruelty in animals that often is
 
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
now one might ask you know why does new
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire need to do this there is some
 
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
federal and international regulation
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's very similar to what we
 
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
have done on issues like wildlife
 
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
trafficking and other animal protection
 
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.029 align:start position:0%
trafficking and other animal protection
errors

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
errors
 
00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
areas where there is federal statute
 
00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
perhaps but
 
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
the feds are not here to enforce and
 
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.110 align:start position:0%
the feds are not here to enforce and
pres

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
pres
 
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
in our state so the feds do interstate
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
we do intrastate so this is a way of
 
00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
providing assurance to our consumers
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
that uh products that they want to
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
purchase have
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
been done in accordance with the
 
00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:23.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
just to go through through some of the
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
issue the areas where this is set up as
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
you have the definitions um
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
set up on the first
 
00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
page and uh for both what the animal
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
testing is what a cosmetic is and then
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
the issue of ingredients here as
 
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
and um what you know there needs to be
 
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
because of federal statute you'll see
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
the cfr is referenced here about
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and non-functional
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
constituents so this is important to
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
make sure we're doing this the same
 
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.390 align:start position:0%
make sure we're doing this the same
definitions

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
under federal
 
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
federal statute
 
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
do note please on page two
 
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh that there are
 
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.749 align:start position:0%
uh that there are
important

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
sections here
 
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
um that define the kinds of testing
 
00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:15.759 align:start position:0%
uh importantly i think on page on page 2
 
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
lines 10 11 um
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
that there's this of course in certain
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
cases needs to continue if there's no
 
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
animal there's no non-animal alternative
 
00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
method or strategy recognized by any
 
00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:27.589 align:start position:0%
method or strategy recognized by any
federal

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
or state agent agency
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
and uh that's certainly important
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
human safety that there are perhaps
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
exceptions here a little bit further
 
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
down same thing
 
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
line 18 there's no non-animal
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
alternative method or strategy
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
recognized by any federal or state
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
agency once again you have that
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
down there
 
00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
um and that the potential again on line
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
21 recognizing that
 
00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes these things
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
these agents propose a risk of causing a
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
specific human health problem that's
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
substantiated and the need to conduct
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
cosmetics animal testing and justified
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
so those are important caveats and
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
provisions there
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
the other thing i'd like to note as well
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
that we amended the bill
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
in the senate because i thought it was
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
important to hold
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
harmless new hampshire retailers this is
 
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
a similar provision as you may recall
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
when we're doing the flame retardants
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
legislation mr chairman we wanted to
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
you know if you're at the tail end of
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
the supply chain and you're retailer in
 
00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:35.919 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
and unknown to you that there has been a
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
violation that you're held harmless for
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
that and i think that's an important
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
addition that we made
 
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
in the in the senate
 
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.790 align:start position:0%
in the in the senate
um

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.230 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
as i said i i think the argument here
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
about what we're trying to do about
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
animal uh cosmetic testing is is pretty
 
00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
clear and is in line with you know
 
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
really the bipartisan consensus in both
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
bodies has developed to try to do what
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
we can for
 
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
for animal protections in in many many
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
ways um
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
and uh i think that it also now would
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
mean that we join at least 8 other
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
states that number may have increased
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
that are part of a national
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
effort to make sure that if interstate
 
00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
commerces is covered let's make sure the
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
intra-state commerce is covered
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
as as well
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
so i'd be glad to take any questions uh
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
any questions to the committee we do
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
have a couple of questions
 
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.150 align:start position:0%
have a couple of questions
yes

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
yes cody sorry thank you thank you
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for bringing this and
 
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
i do have one area that i found a little
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
bit confusing and that's the exemptions
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
that have to do with testing
 
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
from foreign entities
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
a foreign regulatory authorities i'm
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could clarify that in
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
layman's terms so we can understand how
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
that exemption works in the state i will
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
give it a try and then we have kurt
 
00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:05.110 align:start position:0%
give it a try and then we have kurt
aaron

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
aaron
 
00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:08.959 align:start position:0%
uh right here as well but um where
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
which i'm if you could just point page
 
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
page one lines 29 30 and then also on
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
we can't control thank you for your
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
question we can't con you know we here
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire can't control what a
 
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.190 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire can't control what a
foreign

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
nation is doing under its rules
 
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.829 align:start position:0%
nation is doing under its rules
um

00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
but please note uh halfway through line
 
00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:43.509 align:start position:0%
but please note uh halfway through line
30.

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
30.
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
it says provided that no evidence
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
derived from the testing
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
was relied upon to substantiate the
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
safety of the cosmetic
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
ingredient or cosmetic product being
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
sold by the manufacturer
 
00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:10:58.399 --> 00:10:59.190 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
so

00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
here's the here's what that means
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
they might do a process over there
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
that may involve animal testing
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
we can't stop or control that
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
but that study should not be the basis
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
under which we determine whether or not
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:22.710 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
we want to know we want to be assured
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
that the actual
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
safety of that ingredient has determined
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
by testing
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
that is in accordance with the other
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
parts of the bill
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
that say there's just no
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
it protects this is a something that
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
might potentially involve human risk
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
that there's no non-animal
 
00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:44.710 align:start position:0%
that there's no non-animal
um

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
testing possible that otherwise could be
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
used so do you see what i'm trying to
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
say is that it it kind of recognizes the
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
foreign companies going to do that we
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
can't control what they're going to do
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
but for that ingredient we're not going
 
00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
to rely on that to determine whether it
 
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
is in accordance with the united states
 
00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i have trouble with does does
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
it mean that you can't use the
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
ingredient or that we have to do our own
 
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.629 align:start position:0%
ingredient or that we have to do our own
testing

00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
it says that basically what it's trying
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
to say is that
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
our decision about whether we use that
 
00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:19.269 align:start position:0%
our decision about whether we use that
ingredient

00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
ingredient
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
is not going to be based on
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
their testing it's going to be based on
 
00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:24.470 align:start position:0%
their testing it's going to be based on
testing

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
that conforms to the assurances
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
about animal
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
cosmetic testing that is laid out in the
 
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
united states in state statute
 
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks for your question i i i'm
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
sorry it's
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know it i i understand it's a little
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
complicated but the the point is that we
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that when we sign off
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
on something
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
it has been
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
that that sign-off is based on testing
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
that is in accordance with the
 
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
provisions here
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
representative fargo
 
00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.910 align:start position:0%
representative fargo
yes

00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
he'll tell you if i didn't
 
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.629 align:start position:0%
he'll tell you if i didn't
[Laughter]

00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
uh thank you senator yeah and i
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony today but i'm
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
confused because
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
i thought the purpose of this was not to
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
purchase anything
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
i why
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
why would
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
okay so we don't rely on that
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
information but we're still if we know
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
that animals were used why would we
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
why would we even
 
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why we would even
 
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
have this here
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
i would think just the fact that they
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
tested on animals would be enough to say
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't want to purchase that
 
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.150 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't want to purchase that
particular

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.509 align:start position:0%
particular
well

00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:43.519 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question and um i
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
i know we that many of us might wish
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
that this never occurred
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.550 align:start position:0%
at all
however

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
um there are occasions
 
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.790 align:start position:0%
um there are occasions
where

00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
the the medical industry
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
or others who are testing various
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
components that the only way you can
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that it is safe is through
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
animal testing that's why on page two
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
you have that um
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
your own lines 18 to 20 and the other
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
place as well that if
 
00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:18.790 align:start position:0%
place as well that if
indeed

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
indeed
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
under international and federal statute
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
that it is demonstrated that there is
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely no other way to determine the
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
safety is something that is an essential
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
pro essential
 
00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:31.990 align:start position:0%
pro essential
component

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
component
 
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.110 align:start position:0%
component
then

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
animal testing
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
is allowed now i i may not like it or so
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
but i think you can understand the
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
arguments that sometimes for
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
human safety and you know
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
um certain kind of development of
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals and so on that that's
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
that's the guard rail
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
yeah but i i i know what you're saying
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
but there there it is thank you yeah
 
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
thanks very much um i do notice and you
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
made a good point senator that this is a
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill can you tell me what the
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
vote was in the senate this came through
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs
 
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question senator
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
and forgive please tell me if this was
 
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
asked while i was out of the room for a
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
minute but um i did read that there are
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
alternatives to human testing is that
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
something that was asked previously
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i mean what the point of kind of
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
what the bill tries to outline is that
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
it's that we want
 
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
these products to be produced without
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
animal testing that's the bottom line
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
then there's a however
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
there are certain exceptions that are
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
recognized internationally and through
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
federal statute
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
that we kind of
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
boil our plate into here because
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
you know they are federal they are
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
federal statutes but the point is to
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
make this as absolutely tight as
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
possible so that new hampshire consumers
 
00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:10.150 align:start position:0%
possible so that new hampshire consumers
know

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
what they're buying has not been
 
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
produced through
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
i'll follow up for the question main
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
choir okay
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
here's i'll duo would you believe
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
that you know i did read that some of
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
the alternatives to human testing are
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
using human cells and tissues computer
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
modeling and
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
human volunteers
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%

somehow incorporate that into the
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
component with the federal with with um
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
products coming in to see if in fact
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
there are alternatives than using
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
animals to test
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
thank you for your your question and you
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
know thank goodness the technologies are
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
changing right that um you know what
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
that really has been a transformation
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh about
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know what kind of testing because
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
people recognize the
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're just plain unnecessary
 
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
and certainly it is often cruel
 
00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:05.829 align:start position:0%
and certainly it is often cruel
um

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
i think that what you see in the bill
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
and that language there is that there
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
are processes that are in place to say
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
you have to prove you have to prove
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
there's no alternative
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
testing in the united states
 
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
in addition to
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
pcpc which represents approximately 600
 
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
member companies
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
370 individual companies have endorsed
 
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
this federal effort sb 202 was drafted
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
to mirror the provisions found in this
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
federal legislation and i just point out
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
this federal legislation
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason as many
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
initiatives in congress has hit a dead
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
end is stalled is not moving
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
as was said earlier there are eight
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
states hopefully new hampshire will join
 
00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:02.310 align:start position:0%
states hopefully new hampshire will join
them

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
to this momentum toward a more humane
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
way of testing cosmetics
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
animal testing is totally unnecessary
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
it's cruel and not a reliable predictor
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's cruel and it's not a reliable
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
predictor of human responses
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
in traditional animal tests rabbits
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
guinea pigs and mice and rats
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
have substances forced down their
 
00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:30.630 align:start position:0%
have substances forced down their
throats

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
throats
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
dripped into their eyes or smeared onto
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
their skin before they are killed
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
these test methods are unreliable
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
predictors of human safety
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
different species can respond
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
differently when exposed to the same
 
00:23:45.679 --> 00:23:47.190 align:start position:0%
differently when exposed to the same
chemicals

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
chemicals
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
consequently animal tests may under or
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
overestimate real world hazards to
 
00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.070 align:start position:0%
overestimate real world hazards to
people

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
in addition results from animal tests
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
can be quite variable
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
and difficult to interpret
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
so they know they don't serve their
 
00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.870 align:start position:0%
so they know they don't serve their
purpose

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.990 align:start position:0%
purpose
anyway

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.029 align:start position:0%
anyway
so

00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
why would you be for these you know not
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
making a law against
 
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.430 align:start position:0%
making a law against
manufacturers

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
selling these products in new hampshire
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
this is not a bill that holds harmless
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
any retailer
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
any consumer
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
it is about the manufacturer and you'll
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
hear from one of them
 
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.510 align:start position:0%
hear from one of them
soon

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
soon
 
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.470 align:start position:0%
soon
um

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
so this is completely unnecessary
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
there's no animal testing requirements
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
for cosmetic
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
safety substantiation in the united
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
states companies can already create
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
great products using thousands of
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
available ingredients that have a
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
history of safe use and do not require
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
new testing
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
for new ingredients where animal testing
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
may currently be
 
00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
used many non-animal methods have been
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
and continue to be developed
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
non-animal methods can combine human
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
cell-based tests and sophisticated
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
computer models to deliver human
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
relevant results at less cost and in
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
less time than traditional animal tests
 
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
there has been a global trend toward
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
eliminating cosmetic animal testing in
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
2018 california became the first state
 
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
in the country to ban the sale of
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
cosmetics newly tested on animals
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
followed by nevada and illinois in 2019
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth and i won't bore you
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
with all the list of countries that we
 
00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
have here
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
so the humane society of the united
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
states strongly supports sb 202 and
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
urges the committee to pass this
 
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.029 align:start position:0%
urges the committee to pass this
legislation

00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
to make new hampshire the next state to
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
address the unnecessary cruelty of
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:52.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions
 
00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh we do have questions
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
well from on the left side now so
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative griezmann so i'll let you
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
go first
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you sir
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
for coming in this morning
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
do these new non-animal testing methods
 
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
use fetal tissues as their primary
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
source of human cells
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge and i don't know i'm
 
00:26:21.679 --> 00:26:22.789 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge and i don't know i'm
not

00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
an expert on that okay
 
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
can you tell us the eight states that
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.679 --> 00:26:36.070 align:start position:0%
 
hopefully

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.350 align:start position:0%
hopefully
uh

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
virginia maryland maine hawaii new
 
00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.830 align:start position:0%
virginia maryland maine hawaii new
jersey

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
jersey
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
how many is that one two three four five
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh california nevada illinois
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
is that eight
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
okay there you go grub cemetery thank
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
you uh mr chairman uh thank you sir for
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
your uh testimony uh
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
i think for the record it would be safe
 
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.070 align:start position:0%
i think for the record it would be safe
to

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
assume that
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
no one on this
 
00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.430 align:start position:0%
no one on this
committee

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
subscribes to
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
the type of testing that you're seeking
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
to outlaw with this legislation
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
and that would also include inhumane
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
testing on human beings which we know
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
i believe you had indicated
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
in your testimony earlier in your
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
remarks that there was resistance
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
at the federal level
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
and i want to make sure that that i was
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
correct in hearing that
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
but so that i don't have to do a
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up um request i'll just continue
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind
 
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.430 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind
um

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.389 align:start position:0%
um
our

00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
i with many of my purchases i notice
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
the the label cruelty free on the on the
 
00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.950 align:start position:0%
the the label cruelty free on the on the
products

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
are are you aware of of uh and can you
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
identify companies that are resistant uh
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
to this and also any companies
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
that have been prosecuted because of
 
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
their uh
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
failure to comply
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
with the laws that have been enacted
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
today in any of the 41 countries
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
or any of the states that have passed
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
legislation and i'm wondering how it was
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
determined that they
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh or what that they were charged on
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
what basis they were charged and
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
a thank you in advance for the answer to
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
your question i appreciate it mr
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
chairman i yield back the balance of my
 
00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.990 align:start position:0%
chairman i yield back the balance of my
time

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay it's my turn
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the question i uh
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
so first of all
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
the answer is i'm not aware i'm not
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
prepared to
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
to answer that right now
 
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.750 align:start position:0%
to answer that right now
but

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
holds the manufacturer and only the
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturer responsible
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
for this bill that if they did
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
inadvertently sell some product that
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
did not meet the requirements of this
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
law they would not be responsible but
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer would be and there are
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
fines and spelled out in the in the bill
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
what the remedy for that is
 
00:29:16.159 --> 00:29:17.830 align:start position:0%
what the remedy for that is
um

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
we have in new hampshire the may i would
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
say one of the major if not the largest
 
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
cosmetic manufacturer in the state ready
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
to testify here today that you know
 
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
they're willing to take on that
 
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.750 align:start position:0%
they're willing to take on that
responsibility

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
um i don't
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
frankly see why there's any reason
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
why new hampshire would not join
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
the only uh
 
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
the only entity that is
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
at risk here is the manufacturer
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
and the real benefit here is that the
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
consumer of new hampshire
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
every time they go and take something
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
off the shelf then do not have to worry
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
that it may say on the label
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
i mean i have the shampoo i use this
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
morning says
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
this product was not tested on animals
 
00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.029 align:start position:0%
this product was not tested on animals
but

00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know most people in their shopping
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
do not check that and they can rest
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
assured once this is passed and signed
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
into law that in new hampshire
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
everything you buy illegally is not
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.559 --> 00:30:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.789 align:start position:0%
 
who

00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
will make sure that these manufacturers
 
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
are in compliance
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
which what entity what state entity or
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
what federal entity well i i would say
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
like any other uh and there are many i
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
would think and the chairman would know
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
better than i
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
but there are statutes that you would
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
have to make a complaint to the attorney
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
general or some
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
authority if you were if you ran into i
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully the consumer would be our best
 
00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.990 align:start position:0%
hopefully the consumer would be our best
uh

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
police person on this if they uh
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
noticed something and in terms of the
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
issue of a foreign manufacturer
 
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.230 align:start position:0%
issue of a foreign manufacturer
um

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
so note so what this bill says is no
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
test can be used
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
to verify
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh safety
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
no animal test can be used to verify if
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
safe doesn't know where or when or how
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
or who
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
did it
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
it cannot be used to verify the safety
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
of the product
 
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%

i'm here today to express our strong

the sale of cosmetic products that have
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
been tested on animals
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
there is no reason for the continued use
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
of animal test methods in the united
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
states when cosmetic products can be
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
created using thousands of ingredients
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
that have already been proven to be safe
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
ws badger has been producing cruelty
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
free organic skin care in the state of
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire since 1995 so that's 27
 
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.669 align:start position:0%
new hampshire since 1995 so that's 27
years

00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
of putting out cruelty free products
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
we employ a hundred people and we are an
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
employer of choice
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire consumers this bill
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
ensures that they don't have to think
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
twice about the cosmetics that they're
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
shopping for as a manufacturer we've
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
held high standards
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
on our manufacturing our good
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
manufacturing practices
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
and we have had the cruelty-free
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
designation for all of our 27 years
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
our customers expect it they demand it
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
and we see that consumers
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
are growing there's a growing demand by
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
consumers for that cruelty-free mark or
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
that cruelty-free statement
 
00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.070 align:start position:0%
that cruelty-free statement
for

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
personal care cosmetics
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
this bill does not impact retailers we
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
are a manufacturer we are
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
a manufacturer who sells a cosmetic
 
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.350 align:start position:0%
a manufacturer who sells a cosmetic
product

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh we would not have been doing this for
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
27 years if there was a risk
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
to our business
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
the passing of this bill is going to put
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
along with eight other states which kurt
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier um in the right
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.710 align:start position:0%
 
we

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
feel this is really important
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
for new ingredients but that are being
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
used in cosmetic products there are many
 
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
non-animal test methods available that
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
can be used for safety evaluations which
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
was mentioned earlier these alternatives
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
provide data that is more relevant to
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
humans and offer savings in time and
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
cost from traditional animal tests
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned before there are
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
already eight states we'd like new
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire to be the ninth if possible
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
um and we strongly urge you to support
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
sb202 and i promised to make this short
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
what happens when something goes wrong
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
can you define that you are testing new
 
00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.470 align:start position:0%
can you define that you are testing new
ingredients

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
ingredients
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
and you you've made this promise to not
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
use animal testing but you're using
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
volunteer humans
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
what happens when something goes wrong
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
one of those ingredients
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
produces some kind of
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
adverse reaction right how how do you
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
handle that who do you report that to
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
who is regulating that yeah all that
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
stuff so so who are you held accountable
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
to sure in your testing so we are
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
certified cruelty free which means we
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
actually hold it as a standard we have a
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
third party
 
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.349 align:start position:0%
third party
that

00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
ensures that we are following
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
you know cruelty free methods as far as
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
ingredient safety we have a very high
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
standard of checking the ingredients
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
that we source in to our company and we
 
00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.589 align:start position:0%
that we source in to our company and we
use

00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
in our products we also check those
 
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.109 align:start position:0%
in our products we also check those
ingredients

00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
ingredients
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the life cycle of the product
 
00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.870 align:start position:0%
throughout the life cycle of the product
so

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
you know if there's any chance of a
 
00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:08.790 align:start position:0%
you know if there's any chance of a
reaction

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
reaction
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
we are constantly checking to make sure
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
that's not going to happen
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
and we are also
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
if for example someone may have
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
we do make a sore muscle rub which has
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%

new hampshire consumers have every
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
reason to expect that goods on local
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
stores local store shelves are safe and

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
some of the online shopping platforms
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
a flood of counterfeit merchandise is

past few months we have
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
seen news reports of smash and grab

thefts at retail stores where the stolen
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
merchandise ends up on sale on some of
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
these platforms
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
there have been a number of articles on
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
have copies of them i can
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
make copies and have them to the
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%

the on the line senate bill 5 355 offers
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
a practical solution that will provide
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
a boost of transparency where it is
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
desperately needed
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
senate bill 355 would require e-commerce
 
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
platforms to verify high-volume
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
third-party sellers and also establish a
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
notification to concern consumers
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
disclosing where the high-volume seller
 
00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
is located and how they can be contacted
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
this will go a long way to wean out
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
those who masquerade as legitimate
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
sellers and dupe our citizens into
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
purchasing fake faulty or stolen goods
 
00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
their similar legislation has been
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
introduced around the country and
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
support has come from cvs home depot

um so i urge you to support this
 
00:43:59.349 --> 00:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
balanced approach to help protect new
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire's consumers and i will attempt
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%

yesterday i was listening to nhpr and
 
00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:15.990 align:start position:0%
yesterday i was listening to nhpr and
the

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
um some of the
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
average or
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
people that that
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
sell through este
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
have got a week-long and they're calling
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
it a strike even though they're really
 
00:44:26.319 --> 00:44:27.430 align:start position:0%
it a strike even though they're really
independent

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
independent
 
00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.710 align:start position:0%
independent
sellers

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
sellers
 
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
would this bill
 
00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.870 align:start position:0%
would this bill
affect

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
affect
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
those that actually make a product and
 
00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:36.710 align:start position:0%
those that actually make a product and
then

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
if somebody were to buy it
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
and you know like a whole bunch of them
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
and then try to resell them
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
i think someone behind me coming up can
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
testify to that but i do understand that
 
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
if essie has a number of
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
just just like a walmart or an amazon if
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
they have an if sd has a number of
 
00:44:59.040 --> 00:44:59.410 align:start position:0%
they have an if sd has a number of
um

00:44:59.410 --> 00:44:59.420 align:start position:0%

that yes they will probably have to have
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
the um the information required of
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
for the question main car thanks so
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
do you think this might protect those i
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
mean for the most part the sd
 
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.150 align:start position:0%
mean for the most part the sd
um

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
sellers are small
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
are small operators right um they make
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
their own product um and they're not
 
00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.150 align:start position:0%
their own product um and they're not
reselling

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
reselling
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
other people's products do you think
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
this might protect
 
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
okay i can't answer that i understand
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative terry yes uh
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
so uh do i understand that
 
00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
currently there is no liability
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
or only weak liability
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh for on the part of the for example
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
the amazons of the world with respect to
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
third-party sellers if i purchase
 
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
something that's sold by a third-party
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
seller on amazon amazon is in the free
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
and clear right now or is are there weak
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
protections what what's what's going on
 
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
from my understanding there are there
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
are no protections for uh consumers who
 
00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:23.109 align:start position:0%
are no protections for uh consumers who
purchase

00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
00:46:23.119 --> 00:46:24.230 align:start position:0%
purchase
um

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
who purchase these items either smash
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
okay thanks
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
before i call on curtis uh we have a
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
more important person in the room that i
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
like to call
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
and that's brandon garrett from the
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
department of justice
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
because we want him to get back out
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
there and
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
possible i appreciate it i don't know if
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
i would acknowledge that i'm more
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
important than anything
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
say we're all important
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh good morning mr chairperson members
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee brandon garage chief of
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection and antitrust
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
bureau at the new hampshire attorney
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office is here
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
neither in support or against this bill
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
just to provide information to the
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
committee and also a couple of potential
 
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement problems that i see that i
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
think there is probably a remedy to
 
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
um but i would like to start just by
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
saying that you know in response to the
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
question that was just asked and
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
something that's probably on everybody's
 
00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:33.670 align:start position:0%
something that's probably on everybody's
mind

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
is that this is a real problem
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
we regularly receive complaints from
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
consumers where they purchase something
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
on an online platform
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
and there's little to no recourse
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
because it was purchased from a third
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
party seller who's not expressly you
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
know a member of the online marketplace
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
the online marketplace essentially punts
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the third-party seller
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
and the third-party seller can't be
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
identified contacted or prosecuted
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
so it's a large problem for the attorney
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
general's office in having the ability
 
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
to identify and prosecute third-party
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
sellers who are online
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
who are selling counterfeit goods
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
so just as a general idea that we should
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
be having laws in place that provides
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
accountability for third-party sellers
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
identification for third-party sellers
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
i think that's a good thing and i think
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
that this is a significant step in the
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
right direction um i just want to be
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
clear about some hurdles that i would
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
see from an enforcement perspective at
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office as we
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
would be expected to investigate and
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
prosecute any non-compliance
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
with this bill i also want to say um
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
apologize you i we did not testify in
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
the senate and that is because when i
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
originally reviewed this bill
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
i saw as largely a good thing that i
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
thought would work and i received a
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
number of phone calls this week asking
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
me various questions about this so i
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
took a second look um and
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
i think there are a couple of
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement hurdles that should at least
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
be brought to the attention of the
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
committee so that potentially they could
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
be addressed
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
the way that this would work or at least
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
the way that i would see this working
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
from a consumer protection bureau
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement standpoint
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
is if a consumer bought something
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
on amazon or on walmart.com or any of
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
the large online marketplaces um that
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
have what has been designated as um high
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
volume third-party sellers by this bill
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
and the what they got ended up being
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
counterfeit um and they
 
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
this bill would put the the initial
 
00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
burden on the consumer to contact the
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
online on the online marketplace in
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
order to obtain the contact information
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
um for the person that sold them the
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
goods um and the online marketplace
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
would then have an obligation to provide
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
that information
 
00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
um what would happen is that the
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
consumer would file a complaint with the
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office and would say
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
i bought this thing and it was fake
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office would not
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
be in any position at that point to
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
identify whether the third party seller
 
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.150 align:start position:0%
identify whether the third party seller
involved

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
met the definition of a high volume
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
third party seller which has that
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
to the online marketplace so our
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
recourse would be to send a subpoena say
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
to amazon that says identify you know
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
everything in your possession regarding
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
this seller and specifically identify
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
whether they are an online third-party
 
00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:24.069 align:start position:0%
whether they are an online third-party
seller

00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
seller
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
we would if amazon was not compliant
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
with that or you know you said they're
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
not a high volume third-party seller we
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
would have no way to know whether they
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
were being truthful or not short of
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
subpoenaing their sales records
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
in order to determine whether that
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
person actually met the definition of an
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
online third-party seller and those are
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
all you know multiple steps that take
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
multiple months that would cause a
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
substantial delay and a hurdle to
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
investigation and prosecution i think
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
that you know that can be resolved if
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
there was some sort of mechanism that
 
00:50:52.319 --> 00:50:54.309 align:start position:0%
there was some sort of mechanism that
required

00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
online marketplaces to identify
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
and label
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
these high-volume third-party sellers to
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
consumers on the front end so that a
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
consumer that's going on amazon or is
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
going to walmart.com going on ebay any
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
of these marketplaces can choose to do
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
business only with those who have been
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
designated as high volume third party
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
sellers so that they know that if
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
something goes wrong this business is
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
going to have the requirement to provide
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
them with the contact information for
 
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
their business that has been verified in
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
accordance with this law
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
that would give us as the attorney
 
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
general's office if we received a
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
complaint knowledge that
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
the online marketplace had identified
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
this third party seller as a high volume
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
third party seller and therefore would
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
have that contact information that
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
should be provided to the consumer
 
00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
and if then they then didn't
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
it would give the attorney general's
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
office the ability to investigate and
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
prosecute non-compliance with their
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
obligation to obtain verify and provide
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
contact information for high-volume
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
third-party sellers to consumers i know
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
that was very wordy i think that was the
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
most concise way i could possibly say it
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
but i think the the takeaway is that in
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
order for this to be enforceable in a in
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
a swift and manageable way i think there
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
needs to be some requirement for the
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
online marketplace to identify
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
either to the consumers or to the
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office on the front
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
end who are their high-volume
 
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
third-party sellers so that if a
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
consumer is having trouble getting
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
contact information from that business
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
for a particular seller um
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
we'd be able to identify that issue a
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
subpoena and investigate accordingly
 
00:52:32.319 --> 00:52:33.670 align:start position:0%
subpoena and investigate accordingly
the

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
only other issue that i see potentially
 
00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:37.910 align:start position:0%
only other issue that i see potentially
is

00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
there's a carve out in here
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
which is that if the high volume third
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
party seller certifies the online
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
marketplace that the seller does not
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
have a business address and only has a
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
residential street address
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
or a business address and a residential
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
address the online marketplace may
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
disclose only the country and if
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
applicable the state in which the high
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
volume third party seller resides i just
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
want to make clear that if that's the
 
00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
case and that's the only information
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
that's being provided that we would
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
essentially be left without
 
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
an ability to take the next step and
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
investigate and prosecute who that
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
online third-party seller was
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
if all we have is the state in which
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
they reside or the country in which they
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
reside oftentimes that is the
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
information that we have and we need
 
00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559 align:start position:0%
more than that in order to initiate an
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
investigation of the actual third-party
 
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
seller it wouldn't be under this
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
provision but certainly selling
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
counterfeit merchandise online to new
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents as a potential
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
violation of
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act's standing
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
prohibition of unfair and deceptive acts
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
or practices so if we were going to take
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
this information that's provided
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
the contact information for the actual
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
person that's doing the wrong here an
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
initiated investigation we would need
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
more than simply the state that they're
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
located in or the country that they're
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
located in order to do that so i just
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that very clear
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
i think that you know the only other
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
thing you know
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
the committee is
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
not going to be surprised to hear this
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
from me um there was a
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that was done on this and it
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
always raises the questions of resources
 
00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.309 align:start position:0%
always raises the questions of resources
um

00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
it's unclear what additional resources
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
if any would be needed in order to to
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
effectively prosecute this we simply
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
don't know the volume of the complaints
 
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
that it may generate or the scale of the
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
investigations that we would need to
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
undertake in order to enforce this so i
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
just think it's always important to
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
remind the the committee that a
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
significant addition like this may
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
require in the future additional
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
resources for the consumer protection
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
bureau in order to effectively enforce
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
it um and make sure that its provisions
 
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
are upheld and with that i feel that
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
i've been talking for close to a century
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
and we'd be happy to take any questions
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
from any members of the community okay
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative patusek is first up uh
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for mr chair and thank you for
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
testifying i have a question you just
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
brought up a point and about not being
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
able to dig into and find your
 
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.789 align:start position:0%
able to dig into and find your
source

00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
source
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
do you need subpoena power through this
 
00:54:59.599 --> 00:55:02.630 align:start position:0%
do you need subpoena power through this
bill

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
so if this bill works the way it's
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
intended to work
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
and you have a high volume third party
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
seller who is providing information to
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
consumers the way that they're required
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
to under the terms of this bill
 
00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:20.799 align:start position:0%
the process would go that the consumer
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
who was deceived or wronged would
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
contact i'll use amazon just for the
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
sake of a hypothetical and say i
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
purchased from a high volume third party
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
seller please identify to me
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
the name address telephone number
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
contact information for this business
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
assuming that amazon then complied and
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
provided the consumer with that
 
00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.069 align:start position:0%
provided the consumer with that
information

00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
that information could be provided to
 
00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office in the
 
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
form of a consumer complaint and we
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
would be able to know who we're
 
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
investigating we wouldn't need to issue
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
any subpoenas in that regard um
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
certainly we may then choose to issue
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
subpoenas against the third party seller
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
who's the wrong doer in the course of
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
that investigation uh we would have the
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
authority to do that under 358 a and you
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
know the rights and remedies that are
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
available under that section but the
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
hurdle in these cases is identifying the
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
third party seller
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
oftentimes when we receive these
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
complaints we simply are not able to do
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
that and know who we are prosecuting
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
where they're located or how to go about
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
contacting um serving that person with a
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
subpoena serving that person with a
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
civil complaint or you know bringing
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
that person to trial to stand uh
 
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
and face criminal charges which that's
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
the bevy of our remedies under the
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act you need to know
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
who you're investigating who you're
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
prosecuting and this bill i think does a
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
really nice job of creating a solution
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
whereby that information could be easily
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
provided to consumers and to the
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office for that exact
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
purpose um just here to point out some
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
potential issues that i see so i hope
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
that answers your question
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
representative terry ah thank you mr
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh your your uh concise and clear uh
 
00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.710 align:start position:0%
uh your your uh concise and clear uh
description

00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
description
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
of an issue that you have uh uncovered
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
with respect to the mechanism i believe
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
is the term you use
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
to identify
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
high-volume third-party sellers
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
so in view the fact that that mechanism
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
is not contained within this bill at
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
this time
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to work with this
 
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
committee on
 
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
drafting and uh an amendment
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
to it
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
that would address
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
the very real need
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
that i believe you you've convinced me
 
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.109 align:start position:0%
that i believe you you've convinced me
of

00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
make this
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh this bill and if it were to be
 
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
enacted into law actually something that
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
could work and overcome the hurdle i
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
think is the term of use or
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps even the roadblock of
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
identifying who in fact are third-party
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
sellers and i understand what you've
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
said is that you would place that upon
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
the middleman so to speak walmart the
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
platform amazon so forth would you be
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
willing to do that so i
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
am limited in my ability to you know
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
formally commit to that as i would need
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's approval in order
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
to do that but you know as i said i
 
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
think that the intent of this bill is
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
really good i think that the intent of
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses a need that the
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
consumer protection bureau sees on a
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
daily basis so i would certainly um be
 
00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
willing to discuss and recommend to the
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
attorney general that we do that but i
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
would need his ultimate approval before
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
we were able to do that certainly open
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
to it follow and and you will you'll do
 
00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:34.549 align:start position:0%
to it follow and and you will you'll do
that

00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
i will thank you yes
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs excuse me
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett what's before
 
00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.829 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett what's before
you

00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i was just looking
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
at some of the information that's been
 
00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:46.789 align:start position:0%
at some of the information that's been
supplied

00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
supplied
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
to us regarding this bill
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
um do you think it's realistic
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
to require a company like amazon
 
00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
to supply the kind of information you
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
would need
 
00:59:02.079 --> 00:59:03.349 align:start position:0%
would need
to

00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
do i think it's realistic that amazon
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
could provide contact information for
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
its third-party sellers to new hampshire
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i do you do okay good thing i i i i
 
00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:19.030 align:start position:0%
yeah i do you do okay good thing i i i i
mean

00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
i think the bill limits what needs to be
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
provided to verified contact information
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
for the individuals who are using the
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
online marketplace to sell their
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
merchandise and if there's a
 
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
verification and identification process
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
in place for you know you're going to
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
sell on this platform so therefore you
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
need to provide your name your address
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
your telephone number your email address
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
your physical location
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
that information should be
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
recorded verified and easily provided
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully voluntarily by worst-case
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
scenario in response to a subpoena under
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act i certainly
 
00:59:55.839 --> 00:59:57.030 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act i certainly
don't

00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
tend to or represent that i can speak
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
for those businesses to talk about how
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
reasonable it might be or what the cost
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
might be associated with doing that but
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
from my perspective i i would think that
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
providing that sort of contact
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
information would be a reasonable
 
01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:11.829 align:start position:0%
information would be a reasonable
undertaking

01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
undertaking
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
for the question main choir thank you um
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
so have you had occasion
 
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
to have to approach amazon with any of
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
the complaints
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
that you've previously had
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
regarding this issue
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
i i can't speak to amazon specifically
 
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
but we have i can say with confidence
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
that we have received consumer
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
complaints against online marketplaces
 
01:00:34.559 --> 01:00:35.829 align:start position:0%
complaints against online marketplaces
um

01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
i can't recall whether it was there was
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
a counterfeit good or that it was not
 
01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:41.839 align:start position:0%
represented it did not appear in the way
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
it was represented but there was an
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
issue with the good that was sold and
 
01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:47.839 align:start position:0%
we've made efforts to you know subpoena
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
the information from the marketplace and
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
we were unsuccessful in doing so okay
 
01:00:52.559 --> 01:00:53.589 align:start position:0%
we were unsuccessful in doing so okay
thanks

01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question this is
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
a quick question let's just
 
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
hypothetically say you have a bad actor
 
01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
in kazakhstan and you know it's in
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
kazakhstan but there's no way you're
 
01:01:06.309 --> 01:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
gonna be able to
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
go after this person is there a way to
 
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
do you have a remedy to remove them from
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
the marketplace or would that be like up
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
to amazon to do that
 
01:01:15.119 --> 01:01:16.470 align:start position:0%
to amazon to do that
so

01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
do we have a remedy
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
potentially we
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
could but it is a very very long process
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
that would you know
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
require us filing a suit against the
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
online marketplace and asking the court
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
for injunctive relief in the form of
 
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
removing the individual we could do it
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
but you know ultimately the marketplace
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
is in a much much better position to do
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
it and in order for us to
 
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
take on the role of suing amazon suing
 
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
walmart suing ebay every time there's a
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
bad actor that's reported that's in
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
another country to have them remove
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
additional resources we would need to do
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
something like that are astronomical
 
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:04.710 align:start position:0%
something like that are astronomical
the

01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
i think the problem with a lot of these
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
third-party sellers is that they are in
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
other countries um and can't be easily
 
01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
identified so prosecuting them
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
identifying them is a huge hurdle so for
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
for each one of those reports it would
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
not be realistic to think that the
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
attorney general alone
 
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.349 align:start position:0%
attorney general alone
could

01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
sue to have them removed every single
 
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
time that this comes up it requires a
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
different problem and i think the burden
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
of that is probably more easily placed
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
on the company that is allowing them to
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
sell on their platforms which i believe
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
is part of the intent of what this
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
legislation tries to do
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for taking my question so
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
i understand the concept of of the bill
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
part of me understands it my question is
 
01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:53.029 align:start position:0%
part of me understands it my question is
how

01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know amazon and
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
you know home depot and all of these
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
they they aren't they're online they're
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
not here in new hampshire they're all
 
01:03:03.359 --> 01:03:04.230 align:start position:0%
not here in new hampshire they're all
over

01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
how do we control something that's not
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
it's online it's virtual
 
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm trying to understand
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
how we can have those rules on somebody
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
who doesn't was you know isn't here
 
01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:17.829 align:start position:0%
who doesn't was you know isn't here
physically

01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
physically
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
you know i believe that those businesses
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
that you just identified while they do
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
have you know a large online presence
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
they are also physically present in
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
doing business in new hampshire i mean i
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
believe each of the businesses you just
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
identified maintains a physical business
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
presence within the state and is
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
therefore subject to the laws of the
 
01:03:35.839 --> 01:03:39.029 align:start position:0%
therefore subject to the laws of the
state

01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
for the question main choir so even
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
though it's online and it's not in their
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
physical location stores they're not
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
buying you know someone's not going to
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
their store and buying it they're
 
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
actually going online and purchasing it
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
it would still
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
they would still fall under this because
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
they're physically here even amazon
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
amazon does have my understanding it
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
does have a physical presence within the
 
01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.470 align:start position:0%
does have a physical presence within the
state

01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.510 align:start position:0%
state
and

01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
if a business is choosing to do business
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire there's a is a legal
 
01:04:08.079 --> 01:04:09.109 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire there's a is a legal
standard

01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
for whether somebody's conduct
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
sufficiently rises to the level of
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
reaching into the state in order to
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
you know do business in the state so
 
01:04:20.549 --> 01:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
that they're subject to our laws
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
if they have a physical presence in the
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
state i think there's a very strong and
 
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
compelling argument that they are
 
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
subject to all of the laws of the state
 
01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.150 align:start position:0%
subject to all of the laws of the state
as

01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
as it uh pertains to
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
commerce and doing business in the state
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
if you have a business that is purely a
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
hundred percent let's say in california
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
that sells online and sells you know
 
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.309 align:start position:0%
that sells online and sells you know
everywhere

01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
and you know makes the decision to sell
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire even though they don't
 
01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
physically come to new hampshire have a
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
building in new hampshire
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
i personally believe that there is still
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
an argument that could be made that by
 
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
making the decision to sell and ship to
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that they are still doing
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
business in new hampshire sufficiently
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
to subject themselves to these laws but
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
that is an issue that would probably
 
01:05:07.589 --> 01:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
need to be litigated down the road but i
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
i think there's a strong argument for it
 
01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.349 align:start position:0%
i think there's a strong argument for it
um

01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative below
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.950 align:start position:0%
my question
um

01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
the when the bill was drafted
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
senators i'm not sure who the other
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
sponsors are do they
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
when there's a bill um
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
making the judicial
 
01:05:32.559 --> 01:05:33.829 align:start position:0%
making the judicial
branch

01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
branch
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
are there
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
were this set let's say this year where
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
the several bills this year um did they
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
come to you to help draft the bill
 
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
because it does really reflect on your
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
capacity to
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
you know make it happen
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a little bit of a difficult
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
question for me to answer there are
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
certainly occasions in every legislative
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
season where our office receives
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
requests to help draft legislation for a
 
01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons however you know the
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office is a member of
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
the executive branch
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
not of the judicial branch
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
not the legislative branch so we we you
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
know like to come over and you know
 
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
speak to you know if we're going to be
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
enforcing this law how we think or even
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
if we're not how this
 
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
you know particular legislation may
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
contradict or may fall in line with or
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
may you know but heads with other laws
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
in the state or whether it affects the
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
work that we're doing in in our office
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
but the policy of you know
 
01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
how to draft a bill what language should
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
be in it a large portion of that the
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office is not
 
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
involved in just because we we are not
 
01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
the legislature we don't write the laws
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
we enforce them um but certainly if
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
somebody reaches out and says you know
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
what do you think about this is this
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
enforceable we we do our best to be
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
helpful in that case
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
it happens sometimes it does not happen
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
all the time okay thank you so uh on
 
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
your note on that note we do have rule
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
making in this statute
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
and you guys do rule making right don't
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
you do something don't you have condo
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
rules or didn't you guys you you
 
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
generated some rules haven't you we've
 
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
generated a few rules okay because i'd
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
say the secretary of state does not like
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
to regenerate rules we've had that
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
problem so but yeah okay so the only
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
other question just help me out here
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
because um
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
you made a comment that if the if um if
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
amazon could identify on their web page
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
you know who was a a third party
 
01:07:34.559 --> 01:07:35.910 align:start position:0%
you know who was a a third party
and

01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh distributed supplier rather than them
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
um this would be a lot easier to to
 
01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
overcome that first question that you
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
would have to pose to them
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
i i personally find that that i can
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
usually sniff that out by how quickly it
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
gets shipped if it's amazon it gets
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
shipped the next day if it's going to
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
wake take a week or two i find that
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
that's probably a third party company
 
01:07:59.430 --> 01:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
but notwithstanding that here's my
 
01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.589 align:start position:0%
but notwithstanding that here's my
problem

01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
what your amazon is leaving it to the
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
third parties
 
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.150 align:start position:0%
third parties
policies

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
policies
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
so if the third party's return policy is
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
all sales are final
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
even if you were able to identify with
 
01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
them even though you got all this
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
information because they have that
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
policy on their books how does this bill
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
fix that problem
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
well if you if you're transacting with a
 
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
third party seller that plainly
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
discloses to the consumer that all sales
 
01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
are final there would be no problem to
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
address i mean if it's clearly they
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
don't clearly they don't yeah clearly
 
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
they don't do that but that's a very
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
different question from you know all
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
sales are final but if you're selling
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
something that's counterfeit or you're
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
selling something that is deceptively
 
01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
marketed to the consumers that's a
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
violation of the prohibition of unfair
 
01:08:55.349 --> 01:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
and deceptive acts or practices so
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether it violates you
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
know the businesses return policy if
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
what you're doing is inducing a consumer
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
to buy something with false
 
01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
representations that they wouldn't
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise provide that's a problem
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the return policy the
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
return policy wouldn't be the question
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's whether that third-party seller had
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
deceived consumers tricked them
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
essentially into buying a product that
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
was other than how it was represented
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
whether it be counterfeit or simply
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
looks different or it's a different size
 
01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
or different quality whatever it is
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
i believe that the purpose of this bill
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
is so that if a consumer purchases
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
something that is not what it claimed to
 
01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
be on the website um
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
they have a mechanism to identify the
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
third party sellers contact them deal
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
directly with them because right now
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
i i know we've received a lot of
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
complaints from consumers who try to
 
01:09:45.759 --> 01:09:47.110 align:start position:0%
complaints from consumers who try to
contact

01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
contact
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
the marketplace the large company and
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
the actual manufacturer they're told
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
well it's a third party so you have to
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
deal with third party but there's no
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
easy way to identify the third party in
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
order to deal with them which is is the
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
underlying so the hope is that at that
 
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
point the consumer will find out who the
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
actual third party is even though they
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
might be in china they might be at least
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
they know who they are and they'll have
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
a maybe an email or some way to contact
 
01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.229 align:start position:0%
a maybe an email or some way to contact
them

01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
sorry but then how do they prosecute if
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's a if it's a
 
01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:17.990 align:start position:0%
it's a if it's a
fake

01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
fake
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
well i mean it creates an obligation to
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
verify which you know the businesses
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
would have to figure out how they're
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
going to you know have a verification
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
process for their high volume third
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
party sellers so because if they're if
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
they're not doing that it's a potential
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
violation of the statute which is an
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
unfair deceptive act exactly
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
um so you i think the idea is probably
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
that if the
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
marketplace is required to collect and
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
verify information for its high volume
 
01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
third-party sellers that the
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
marketplaces will do a better job of
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
deciding who they can and can't allow to
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
sell on their platforms
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
if they can't verify the information so
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
if it's fake information through that
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
verification process the marketplace in
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
theory um would be able to
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
realize that and so the idea is
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully remove the seller before
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
enticing it is to make the companies
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
think twice before they sign somebody up
 
01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
in their products
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully they'll i'm not sure i would
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
phrase it that way but it is it's the
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
intent is to have some accountability
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
so that there is transparency for
 
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
consumers about who they are actually
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
doing business with when they log into
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
amazon.com or walmart.com consumers
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
often think they're doing business with
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
walmart or doing business with amazon
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
you have to look i mean it usually is
 
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
disclosed this is a third-party seller
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
but you have to look carefully in order
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
to find out who it is and it usually
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
discloses it in the in the form of a
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
business name uh not in the name of a
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
not in the form of an actual name of a
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
person or an address for the person or a
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
telephone number for the person figuring
 
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
out who is ultimately responsible is
 
01:11:59.350 --> 01:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
very difficult for consumers and frankly
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
very difficult for the attorney
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
general's office so i think that is the
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
problem that this bill seeks to um
 
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
remedy and i i i would speak just
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
briefly to you you made a comment about
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
rulemaking certainly this does give us
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
the ability to make rules um and we do
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
we do rule making um but
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
you spoke about the the condominiums
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
um when you have statutes and you have
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
rules and you have to understand the
 
01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
interplay between the statutes and the
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
rules and make sure that both line up
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
and both are consistent it's much much
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
trickier to enforce and understand than
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
if the the statute itself just clearly
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
anticipates the potential issues uh and
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
deals with them on the on the front end
 
01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
certainly we're not we're not afraid of
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
rule making we do rule making we'd be
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
happy to do rule making if it was
 
01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate but i i think the goal
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
should be to to not have to necessitate
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
that in order to clean up something um
 
01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
that probably could be easily resolved
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
on the front end i 100 agree with you
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative burroughs has
 
01:12:58.870 --> 01:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
another question
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair this is a more of a
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
would you believe relative to what you
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
brought up um i'm looking on amazon's
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
site and it says their a to z guarantee
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
will protect you when you buy items sold
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
and fulfilled by a third-party seller
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
and i think most major companies like
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
walmart cvs etc do the same thing so you
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
probably don't have to deal with that if
 
01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
you get garbage from some third party
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
is that true
 
01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
i certainly am not in a position to
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
every side
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
but in your experience you've had amazon
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
say that's a third-party manufacturer so
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
we don't take responsibility for their
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh i can't speak to whether that
 
01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
specific guarantee was in place at the
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
time that the you know i don't have
 
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
dates in the back of my mind i've been
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
in this position now for
 
01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.350 align:start position:0%
in this position now for
um

01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
coming up on like either three or four
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
years i can't recall and you know i
 
01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
don't know how long that's been in place
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it was in place at the
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
time that we received the specific
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
complaints or if the complaints were
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
even against amazon i'm just speaking
 
01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
generally about you know we receive
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
thousands of complaints every year and i
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
review every single one of them so based
 
01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:08.950 align:start position:0%
review every single one of them so based
on

01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
my history of doing that there have been
 
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
complaints against marketplaces where
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
this was an issue i can't speak to
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
whether it was i guess i'm on the i've
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
always thought that one of the reasons i
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
am an amazon prime member is hey i get
 
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
free shipping and b if anything does not
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
meet i don't have to give an excuse
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
i should be able to return it i just
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
assume everything was returnable but
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's where i guess i'm a little lost
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
here but representative terry you have
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
another mr chair uh not that i need to
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
to validate the information that
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs has shared but
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
by personal experience
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
amazon has has always stood behind
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
any uh issue
 
01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
with a third-party seller and i've
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
received an immediate refund over the
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
telephone right away
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
so um apparently
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
that while this may be an issue we're
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
also seeing that the third party the the
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
marketplace the the platform amazon for
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
example and and yes i believe even
 
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
walmart on one or two occasions uh has
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
stepped up and said look if if we are
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh putting forward these third-party
 
01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:16.870 align:start position:0%
uh putting forward these third-party
sellers

01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
sellers
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
we believe we have a responsibility uh
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
and we will take care of this you'll get
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
your money we'll deal with a third party
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
seller i'm not saying that this
 
01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
legislation is unnecessary but um amazon
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
and walmart are are not
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
claiming in my experience that um
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
they're that they have no responsibility
 
01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
whatsoever quite to the contrary we'll
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
leave that as a would you believe
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
all right but thank you very much thank
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
you all thank you i appreciate it okay
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh curtis berry representing new
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire retail association in support
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%

thank you and i had to check the clock
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%

01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
is uh good morning members of the
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%

01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
behalf of the new hampshire retail
 
01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.270 align:start position:0%
behalf of the new hampshire retail
association

01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
which members know
 
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
represents retailers both large and
 
01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:08.870 align:start position:0%
represents retailers both large and
small

01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
small
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill um
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
i have
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair two preface statements i think
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh the first one is to maybe get us back
 
01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.149 align:start position:0%
uh the first one is to maybe get us back
to

01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
what the purpose of the bill does in
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
some of what it does
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
i think my testimony that i prepared
 
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
will answer some of the questions
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
particularly represent bartlett's
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
question about etsy representative terry
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
had a question in there some of that
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
will be answered and i'm happy to expand
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
on that if it doesn't clear it up
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
but a couple of points i'd like to make
 
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
at the outset first this is not new
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire specific language the language
 
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
that you see here and by the way i've
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
distributed two documents two color
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
documents that you should have one's a
 
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
flow chart of how the bill is intended
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
to work the other one is a map of the
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
united states showing the progress of
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
this legislation to date
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
you'll see it's passed a number of
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
bodies in some states it's enacted
 
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
and working
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
in some states it's on its way to being
 
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
enacted and my understanding is the
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
recent action this year is using
 
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
identical almost identical or extremely
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
similar language it's also
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh identical to language that's in the
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
united states congress currently
 
01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:25.030 align:start position:0%
united states congress currently
so

01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that the folks that i
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
represent in the major retailer section
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
of the retail association
 
01:17:34.709 --> 01:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
plus walmart mr demers will represent
 
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
walmart in testimony a little bit later
 
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
on have been working on this issue for a
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
very long time there are folks a lot
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
smarter than i that have been working on
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
this language and it's compromise at
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
this point between all the players
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
um that that have been mentioned several
 
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
times so again it's not new hampshire
 
01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
language it's not necessarily new or
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
created uh just in the senate there's a
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
reason why everything's there
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
i can tell you
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
that this
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
is a priority piece of legislation for
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire retail association
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of the bill is not
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
really addressing
 
01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
the the average consumer the person that
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
receives the goods because as you just
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
discussed there are remedies currently
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
in place for that
 
01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill is to address what we
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
in the retail industry called organized
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
retail theft
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
people who steal
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
from stores your brick and mortar stores
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire and elsewhere
 
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
in quantities enough to sell and make a
 
01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:37.910 align:start position:0%
in quantities enough to sell and make a
profit

01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
profit
 
01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.430 align:start position:0%
profit
so

01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
to step back a little bit
 
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
over the last 20 years the new hampshire
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
retail association has identified areas
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire statutes that we
 
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
felt were weak relative to
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
organized retail theft
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
and we worked several times with the
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
folks downstairs in the criminal justice
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
committee explaining to them the problem
 
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
and through their legislative efforts we
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
think we've got some of the strongest
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
theft statutes on the books so much so
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
that we've gotten compliments from folks
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
in the retail industry in other parts of
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
of the country
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
we've given law enforcement tools to
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
impose uh harsh or stiff penalties we've
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
given law enforcement tools to go after
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
the middle man
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
the fence if you will to use common
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
parlance and fairly effectively
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
so we're proud of what we've done with
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature and we think this bill
 
01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
is another piece in that package of
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
statutes that helps
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
deter theft
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
it's an issue that's
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
so important to the retail association
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
that it presents annually a law
 
01:19:48.630 --> 01:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement partner of the year
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
for folks in the law enforcement
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
community that go above and beyond in
 
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
helping us prevent theft
 
01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:55.669 align:start position:0%
helping us prevent theft
um

01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
that issue that problem has only been
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
exacerbated by the pandemic and we've
 
01:19:59.679 --> 01:20:00.630 align:start position:0%
exacerbated by the pandemic and we've
seen

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:01.750 align:start position:0%
seen
folks

01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
um more frequently our members believe
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
their items that have been stolen appear
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
on online marketplaces
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh which is why we're coming to you
 
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:12.950 align:start position:0%
uh which is why we're coming to you
today

01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:15.430 align:start position:0%
today
um

01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
it's the organized retail theft by the
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
way is uh identified by the us
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
department of homeland security as a
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
problem that reaches
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
the level of 500 billion dollars a year
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
it is an enterprise it is a criminal
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
enterprise but it is an enterprise
 
01:20:30.239 --> 01:20:32.629 align:start position:0%
enterprise but it is an enterprise
nonetheless

01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
nonetheless
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
we think markets should be fair and
 
01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:36.470 align:start position:0%
we think markets should be fair and
equal

01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
equal
 
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
typically we prefer the government to
 
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
stay out of how we do business
 
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
customers should be able to make a
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
decision who and where they buy items
 
01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.189 align:start position:0%
decision who and where they buy items
from

01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
but again this we view as a tool to help
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
prevent and address a large criminal
 
01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:56.070 align:start position:0%
prevent and address a large criminal
enterprise

01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
enterprise
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
as i said the the entities
 
01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
driving this issue in this state and
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
across the country a large major
 
01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.870 align:start position:0%
across the country a large major
retailers

01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
retailers
 
01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
they represent for the retail
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
association over 100 locations in the
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
state and tens of thousands of employees
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
but please don't get the idea to this is
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
a problem that's unique to large
 
01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:16.950 align:start position:0%
a problem that's unique to large
retailers

01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
retailers
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
if you remember back shortly after the
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
first of the year there was an incident
 
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
that was that received a lot of
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
attention in the newspapers
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
a smoke bomb was let off in a jewelry
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
store in salem in what we're told was a
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
failed attempt at theft
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
smash and grab as
 
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
senator birdsall mentioned and the idea
 
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
is they're going to come in and they're
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
going to grab a bunch of stuff and leave
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
if we allow them
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
free unfettered access to online
 
01:21:45.199 --> 01:21:46.550 align:start position:0%
free unfettered access to online
marketplaces

01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
marketplaces
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to continue to sell and
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to continue to steal and
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to either provide a
 
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
deterrent or a way to to address that to
 
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
catch them um as i mentioned there is
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
federal legislation pending
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
we do prefer a federal solution
 
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
and we also all know how quickly
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
congress acts
 
01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
um so the map shows you
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh the the vast amount of activity
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's happened to date
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
in just over three months in this year
 
01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:15.350 align:start position:0%
in just over three months in this year
alone

01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
alone
 
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
um because the states recognize that
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
they agree with us there's a problem
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
congress is not acting and and we should
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
at the state level um
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
so let me get into some specifics of the
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
bill um and there's at least one piece
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
of the attorney general's uh testimony i
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
wanna i wanna address
 
01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.110 align:start position:0%
wanna i wanna address
um

01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
like to start with page one line ten i
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
think in my mind this is the
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
really the key piece that drives this
 
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
which is the definition of
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
uh high volume third party set seller
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
key pieces here it's a participant in an
 
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
online marketplace who is a third-party
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
seller which is also defined here who
 
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
in any continuous 12-month period
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
during the previous 24 months has
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
entered into
 
01:23:11.669 --> 01:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
200 or more discrete sales
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
of transactions of new
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
unused consumer products
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
and an aggregate of a total of five
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
so to even
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements as a seller
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
under this statute
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
you have to meet both of those
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
qualifications with three qualifications
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
actually new items
 
01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh 200 or more discreet sales in that
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
short period of time and a total of five
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars more in gross revenues
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
um the next requirement in that same
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
definition is that it requires
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
um this is applies more to the
 
01:23:46.159 --> 01:23:47.350 align:start position:0%
um this is applies more to the
marketplace

01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
but the transaction has to be processed
 
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
by the online marketplace
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
so if i'm looking at a classified ad and
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
i see a used basketball hoop and i go to
 
01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
the person's home and buy it and i give
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
them cash for that that doesn't apply no
 
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
matter how many basketball hoops that
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
individual is selling because it's
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
my transaction cash transaction with him
 
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
the bill when it comes down to it
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
requires the online marketplace to do
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
essentially three things
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
it requires them to collect information
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
from those people that qualify under
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
that definition
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
it requires them to verify that
 
01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:29.990 align:start position:0%
it requires them to verify that
information

01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
and it requires
 
01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:32.310 align:start position:0%
and it requires
that

01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
the marketplace
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
the bill requires the marketplace to
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
require of those sellers to provide
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
a smaller portion of information to the
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
consumer when they purchase it on the
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
what it does not do is equally as
 
01:24:49.199 --> 01:24:50.790 align:start position:0%
what it does not do is equally as
important

01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
it does not require that any sensitive
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
information from the seller
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
is disclosed to the public
 
01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.510 align:start position:0%
is disclosed to the public
and

01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
page 4 line 22 which is the home address
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
that the attorney general referenced
 
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
is in the section of the bill
 
01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.750 align:start position:0%
is in the section of the bill
referencing

01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
referencing
 
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
notice to the consumer
 
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
that's a privacy issue
 
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
if you're a seller on amazon etsy
 
01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.030 align:start position:0%
if you're a seller on amazon etsy
whatever

01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
and your place of business is your home
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
address we shouldn't say the state is
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
requiring you to send out to your
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
customers your home address if you don't
 
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
want to that is a privacy protection
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
that's built into the bill it's a
 
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
the bill also does not require the
 
01:25:37.110 --> 01:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
marketplace to take any action with law
 
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement i think has already been
 
01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.590 align:start position:0%
enforcement i think has already been
discussed

01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
01:25:43.110 --> 01:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
from our perspective the retail industry
 
01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.070 align:start position:0%
from our perspective the retail industry
if

01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:45.669 align:start position:0%
if
someone

01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
someone
 
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
believes that some merchandise is
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
showing up on an online marketplace they
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
believe has been stolen
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
they can approach they will approach the
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
marketplace and say hey help us out
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
we think this is stolen here's why we
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
think this is our stuff can you look
 
01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
into it for us
 
01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
only after information has been gathered
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
and the retailer collects that
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
information would they approach law
 
01:26:10.149 --> 01:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement say here's our information
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
and at that point
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
the normal legal process
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh takes place court order warrant that
 
01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
sort of thing a normal investigation so
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
our focus here is twofold
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
stolen item stolen mass quantities from
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
retailers um and counterfeit goods which
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
i'll also address in a little bit
 
01:26:28.159 --> 01:26:32.229 align:start position:0%
i'll also address in a little bit
um

01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
so the bill simply says
 
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
that if the marketplace meets the
 
01:26:38.229 --> 01:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
definitions the seller meets the
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
definitions you collect verify
 
01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:41.750 align:start position:0%
definitions you collect verify
um

01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
the information and pass it on uh to the
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
consumer is smaller portion
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
um i've already discussed the language
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
that it's that it's mirrored after
 
01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.470 align:start position:0%
that it's that it's mirrored after
um

01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
relative to uh representative bartlett's
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
question about etsy and these are people
 
01:26:58.950 --> 01:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
i believe if i understand etsy they
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
create their own things
 
01:27:04.149 --> 01:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
the bill also serves as a protection for
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
the producers as well
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
there are lots of articles you can find
 
01:27:10.149 --> 01:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
online about
 
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers of the original
 
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.350 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers of the original
article

01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
article
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
whose products have been knocked off and
 
01:27:17.590 --> 01:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
then sold online
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
products are probably awful they get bad
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
reviews but the bad reviews are a
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
reflection on the original manufacturer
 
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
right so it hurts their business this
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
protects them as well in that way to
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
address uh their counterfeit products so
 
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
i think there's protection for sellers
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
the other protection uh for sellers is
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
if i'm selling a piece of stolen
 
01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.990 align:start position:0%
if i'm selling a piece of stolen
merchandise

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
merchandise
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
i've acquired it for nothing my cost of
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
goods sold and business power parlance
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
is zero
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
so anything i sell it for is pure profit
 
01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
meaning i can sell it for a fairly low
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
price potentially undercutting somebody
 
01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:53.110 align:start position:0%
price potentially undercutting somebody
else

01:27:53.110 --> 01:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
some legitimate seller
 
01:27:54.719 --> 01:27:55.590 align:start position:0%
some legitimate seller
um

01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
so those are just a couple of examples
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
of how it protects
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
the sellers as well
 
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:04.719 align:start position:0%
i will wrap up by saying uh in our
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
opinion again it's a priority bill for
 
01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
the retail association
 
01:28:08.239 --> 01:28:09.189 align:start position:0%
the retail association
um

01:28:09.189 --> 01:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
without this in place
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
we're pro continuing to allow
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
the people who are selling stolen
 
01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
merchandise or counterfeit merchandise
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
to continue to hide in the shadows
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
without any deterrence and without any
 
01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.390 align:start position:0%
without any deterrence and without any
repercussions

01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:24.400 align:start position:0%
repercussions
 
01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer questions to the the
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
best of my ability but i hope i brought
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
some focus about the intention of the
 
01:28:29.679 --> 01:28:31.430 align:start position:0%
some focus about the intention of the
bill

01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative bartlett
 
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i forgot to ask uh
 
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
senator birdsdale what the vote was in
 
01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
the senate uh the vote out of committee
 
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
commerce committee was five to nothing
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
and it passed on a voice vote in the
 
01:28:44.639 --> 01:28:46.470 align:start position:0%
and it passed on a voice vote in the
senate

01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for that representative terry
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so so i have a a senator
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
outside who's pleaded with me to move
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
things along in here and i said well
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
there's only so much i can do
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
i do have a question
 
01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh and i think um
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
you might be able to answer it with a
 
01:29:07.110 --> 01:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
yes or no but don't feel constrained by
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
what i've been heard in the hall
 
01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
certainly if you feel like you need to
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
expand on the answer i believe you've
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
heard uh
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
the suggestion made that there be a
 
01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:18.790 align:start position:0%
the suggestion made that there be a
mechanism

01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
such that and i'm trying to picture this
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
that i'm online and uh amazon has a
 
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
third party seller and it's a high
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
volume seller and there's there's maybe
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
a badge or a label there that says
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
verified um high volume third party
 
01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
seller okay
 
01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
do you believe the members of your
 
01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:38.870 align:start position:0%
do you believe the members of your
association

01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:29:40.149 --> 01:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
amenable if
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps not even supportive
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
of what has been suggested here today to
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
effectively strengthen
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
this bill that you overwhelmingly favor
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
um i cannot answer yes or no
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
what i can say is you know certainly
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
we'd pass something along what i do know
 
01:30:00.159 --> 01:30:01.669 align:start position:0%
we'd pass something along what i do know
is

01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
that because of the
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
long history of language being developed
 
01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
you know more than just
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
2022. you know it's been a few years
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
and the parties that have signed on to
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
this i would be hesitant to suggest any
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
changes to to this bill we're we're
 
01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
satisfied that for our purposes this
 
01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
bill will work
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions cnn thank you very
 
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
much thank you and i will attend the
 
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee tomorrow okay
 
01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:34.719 align:start position:0%
uh chairs michael gaia michael gayes of
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
my name is michael gea i'm the president
 
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire police association
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire police association is
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
an organization that represents all
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
aspects of law enforcement in the state
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
from a first-year police officer to a
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
chief of police
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
we are here today in support of senate
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
bill 355.
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
many of you have probably seen recent
 
01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
news accounts of smash and grab thefts
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
at retail establishments
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
this is a criminal problem that is
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
occurring in almost every state
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
it is a significant concern that creates
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
increased police activity and it creates
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
a feeling of insecurity for many
 
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.229 align:start position:0%
a feeling of insecurity for many
businesses

01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
organized thefts really thrive when
 
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
there is the opportunity to easily sell
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
stolen goods
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly some online platforms
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
make it way too easy
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
for them to anonymously unload stolen
 
01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.870 align:start position:0%
for them to anonymously unload stolen
property

01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
without the appropriate verification by
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
these platforms of who the sellers are
 
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
criminals utilize the anonymous aspects
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
of some marketplace platforms
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
additionally retail stores and their
 
01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
employees are put in harm's way when
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
professional thieves confront them to
 
01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
steal merchandise that is sold online
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm certain just about every police
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
department in new hampshire has received
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
complaints about counterfeit merchandise
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
being sold to our residents
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
many of these illicit products
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
come from overseas so catching them is
 
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
difficult but the simple verification
 
01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.070 align:start position:0%
difficult but the simple verification
process

01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
and easy disclosures in sb 355 will have
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
a detrimental effect on criminal use of
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
these platforms
 
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
we believe passage of sb 355 will help
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of stolen property
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
that is sold online it will help curtail
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
the smash and grab theft we are seeing
 
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
so often and it will make it extremely
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
difficult for fraudsters to unload
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
counterfeit goods
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
because they won't be able to hide
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
behind an anonymous posting
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
sp 355 is good for consumers and is good
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
for legitimate sellers who are up
 
01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
against these bad actors for these
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
reasons the new hampshire police
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:57.679 --> 01:32:59.430 align:start position:0%
 
great

01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%

uh thank you mr chairman um

i'm to sort of get rid of the text or
 
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
the speech i was going to give you and
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
sort of cut to the chase appreciate it
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
um so let me just say though for the
 
01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
non-walmart the other two clients of
 
01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
mine pharma as you've heard earlier is
 
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
very concerned about
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
counterfeit drugs medicines that are now
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
finding their way
 
01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
onto some of these marketplaces
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
they're dangerous they're not real
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
and it is a growing problem
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
and the consumer health products
 
01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:54.709 align:start position:0%
and the consumer health products
association

01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
represents the over-the-counter
 
01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:58.629 align:start position:0%
represents the over-the-counter
companies

01:33:58.629 --> 01:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
and they're seeing
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
knock off cough syrups pain medications
 
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
even baby formula
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
that is being
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
marketed on some of these websites and
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
it's a growing problem that
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
those are you know the reasons why those
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
two groups are supportive of this bill
 
01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:20.229 align:start position:0%
two groups are supportive of this bill
i

01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
listening today i felt like the
 
01:34:23.669 --> 01:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
conversation was getting a little bit
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
more complicated than what the bill
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
actually does
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
because if you
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
if you look at the enforcement provision
 
01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
which is 358 t4
 
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
that doesn't alter any of the criminal
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
prosecution prosecution aspects
 
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.669 align:start position:0%
prosecution prosecution aspects
of

01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
any counterfeit or stolen goods
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
the enforcement strictly
 
01:34:51.669 --> 01:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
deals with the marketplace if you look
 
01:34:54.629 --> 01:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
at every shell that's in this bill
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
the shells apply to
 
01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
the online marketplace
 
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
and so this actually i believe gives our
 
01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
better access to information
 
01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.030 align:start position:0%
better access to information
because

01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
now we are saying that
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
the information that these online
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
marketplaces gather
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
have to be verified and the ag
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
during their investigation can ask to
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that the verification process
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
was adhered to
 
01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
i would think that means prove it
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
show us that you what you did to verify
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh that the entity
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
um is legitimate
 
01:35:37.199 --> 01:35:38.070 align:start position:0%
um is legitimate
and

01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
really this takes i think a significant
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
burden off of
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
the ag because
 
01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
we're placing the burden up front
 
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
on the marketplace to know who
 
01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:52.709 align:start position:0%
on the marketplace to know who
their

01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
customers are
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
and if they can't verify
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
the items that are listed in this bill
 
01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's their responsibility not to put
 
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
them on their platform
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
and that's going to have a gigantic
 
01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:09.270 align:start position:0%
and that's going to have a gigantic
effect

01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
on making sure that the fraudsters don't
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
even make their way
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
into the marketplace
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
you know the the thing that any criminal
 
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
or fraudster enjoys is
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
being anonymous
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
and under the current situation
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
because many of these platforms are not
 
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
verifying who they're dealing with
 
01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
they're receiving fake information
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
fake names
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
um fake
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
tax identification numbers
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
um they receive their payment from these
 
01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:42.709 align:start position:0%
um they receive their payment from these
platforms

01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
platforms
 
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
and they're gone in a week
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
so you can be sure that if somebody a
 
01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:48.950 align:start position:0%
so you can be sure that if somebody a
criminal

01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
has to be verified on who they are
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
there's a pretty good chance they're not
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
going to go to the platform
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
now law enforcement
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general's office
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
knows who that person is
 
01:37:04.229 --> 01:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
so i really think that
 
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
this bill goes a long way to
 
01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
to take the burden off of law
 
01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:10.470 align:start position:0%
to take the burden off of law
enforcement

01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
it will
 
01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
really places the burden on the
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
marketplace to know who their customers
 
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.270 align:start position:0%
marketplace to know who their customers
are

01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
to not put them
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
on the platform because they verified if
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
they're real or not
 
01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:24.149 align:start position:0%
they're real or not
um

01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
this doesn't alter any criminal aspect
 
01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
the prosecution of any fraudster is
 
01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:34.159 align:start position:0%
going to be handled
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
whether this bill passes or not exactly
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
the same way so
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
i think this bill has significant merit
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
and as curtis indicated it has passed in
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
several states
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
walmart and others think it would be an
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
important step for new hampshire to join
 
01:37:53.590 --> 01:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
those states
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
so we would urge you to support this
 
01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.830 align:start position:0%
so we would urge you to support this
measure

01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr trump this bill came
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
over to us as amended by the senate and
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
curtis had testified that
 
01:38:07.679 --> 01:38:08.870 align:start position:0%
curtis had testified that
um

01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:10.709 --> 01:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
he was hesitant to change any of the
 
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
language can you tell me how it was
 
01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:13.430 align:start position:0%
language can you tell me how it was
amended

01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
amended
 
01:38:14.830 --> 01:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
um as you heard earlier the significant
 
01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:20.310 align:start position:0%
um as you heard earlier the significant
stakeholders

01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
walmart the retail merchants association
 
01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:25.350 align:start position:0%
walmart the retail merchants association
amazon

01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
amazon
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
took the
 
01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
federal legislation of which everybody
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
has signed off on
 
01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh and converted that into this bill
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
so this the bill we had before was not
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
identical to what the federal bill is
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
that everybody
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
has been working to try to get past in
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
washington so
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
this model this bill that you have
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
before you is completely modeled after
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
the federal bill of which
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
with the exception of one state that's
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
what all the states are doing as well
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
i mean i think you did hear
 
01:38:59.189 --> 01:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
from from curtis that everyone's
 
01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
preference would be
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
to deal with this at the federal level
 
01:39:05.669 --> 01:39:05.679 align:start position:0%
this bill has been hanging around and
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's not on anyone's high agenda in
 
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.189 align:start position:0%
it's not on anyone's high agenda in
washington

01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
washington
 
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
so i think there's just this growing
 
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
feeling that it's time to try to do
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
something if washington's not going to
 
01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
okay so this sorry
 
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
so this bill is the federal bill that is
 
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.750 align:start position:0%
so this bill is the federal bill that is
correct

01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
would those changes have been in the
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
exemptions of what is a high volume
 
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
everything yes the definitions are
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
exactly what's in i'm saying the one
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
state that's different
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
oh um sorry
 
01:39:40.149 --> 01:39:40.159 align:start position:0%
i think i hope that's on arkansas where
 
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
walmart's located it is arkansas okay
 
01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
we'll get arkansas okay
 
01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:46.870 align:start position:0%
we'll get arkansas okay
representative

01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um this may be a
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
different type of problem um that
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't come under this bill i'm not
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
sure but i've seen
 
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
several uh advertisements online for
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
example i saw one
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
with uh honda
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh generators and they had a whole bunch
 
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
of honda generators in the picture and
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
they were saying
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
over stock we're selling these for 50
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
bucks i saw the same thing on
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh steel products chainsaws leaf blowers
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
is that come under this i looked at that
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
and said this is just a scam um because
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
they were so underpriced so if those
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
products are being sold by the actual
 
01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:27.430 align:start position:0%
products are being sold by the actual
manufacturer

01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
they're not under this if those products
 
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
are being sold through one of these
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
online marketplaces like amazon or
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
walmart site
 
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
then they would fall under the same
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
requirements of having to
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
supply the information that's listed
 
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
here and then be verified
 
01:40:45.119 --> 01:40:46.070 align:start position:0%
here and then be verified
okay

01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
they understand the key element there if
 
01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
you got an email from somebody
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
this unless it's unless it was one of
 
01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:55.109 align:start position:0%
this unless it's unless it was one of
these

01:40:55.109 --> 01:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
online marketeers
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
then it would not qual this this
 
01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
legislation won't help that's true but i
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
mean i i don't really know i didn't look
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%
into it because i just thought it was a
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
scam and it probably was it probably was
 
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.030 align:start position:0%
scam and it probably was it probably was
but

01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
i'll have to look into it more carefully
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative johnson
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for taking my question
 
01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:18.870 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for taking my question
um

01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
would this apply to like the facebook
 
01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
marketplace uh craigslist things like
 
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
that because they really don't
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
you know people just post stuff on there
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
and for sale and you can pay through
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
paypal or whatever
 
01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
would that apply to these
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
platforms it actually does not apply if
 
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
like an online classified ad so if the
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
transaction is not being facilitated by
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
the platform but they're merely
 
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
connecting you with the seller
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
to negotiate your deal like a newspaper
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
ad would do they are not included in
 
01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
i think the key element is where's the
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
who's got the money so if you're
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
handing the money to that directly to
 
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
that person
 
01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:04.719 align:start position:0%
for the product and they're shipping it
 
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
to you they would be exempt from this
 
01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:07.350 align:start position:0%
to you they would be exempt from this
correct

01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:08.550 align:start position:0%
correct
okay

01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
i know i'm responsible evidently your
 
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:12.880 align:start position:0%

01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:15.750 align:start position:0%

representative

01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to would you believe sure
 
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
you can go ahead
 
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:20.960 align:start position:0%

01:42:22.719 --> 01:42:23.750 align:start position:0%
your testimony i hope what would you
believe

01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:24.629 align:start position:0%
believe
um

01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of the
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
the products that were used to be
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
prescription products are now
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
over the counter
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
and i buy a lot of them through amazon
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
because they're way lot cheaper
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
and the consumer me has the last
 
01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility i look at the packaging i
 
01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
look at the bottles i look at the seals
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
i look at the product itself to make
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
sure this is virtually the same thing
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
that i've been buying for
 
01:42:55.590 --> 01:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
whatever period would you believe
 
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
yes i i would believe but i will tell
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
you that there are a lot of people that
 
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
receive those
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
counterfeit products in packaging that
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
they think it's the real product and i'm
 
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
you may be more vigilant than others but
 
01:43:10.470 --> 01:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
who think it's sold online it's got to
 
01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:13.590 align:start position:0%
who think it's sold online it's got to
be

01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know the real item and it's not
 
01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
well would you believe okay that's
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
enough thank you very much
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
yes and with that we'll close the public
 
01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
hearing thank you mr chairman but
 
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
according to consumer reports uh this
 
01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:26.149 align:start position:0%
according to consumer reports uh this
month

01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
amazon is the most expensive when it
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
comes to pharmaceuticals
 
01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:32.390 align:start position:0%
comes to pharmaceuticals
so

01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
able to take that
 
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
is that would you believe all right we
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
will move quickly into the next bill i
 
01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
would say on this bill 355 there were 21
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
in support two opposed
 
01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:44.550 align:start position:0%
in support two opposed
and

01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679 align:start position:0%
senator burchell and bruce berkey was in
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:28.550 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:30.070 --> 01:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
if you didn't save all these bills for
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
the end to get out of your committee
 
01:44:32.950 --> 01:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have all shown up at the
 
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
end and might give it exactly you know
 
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
i'm glad we passed that one over for
 
01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%

so there's a little history with this
 
01:45:28.719 --> 01:45:29.590 align:start position:0%
so there's a little history with this
bill

01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:30.470 align:start position:0%
bill
when

01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
i sat in commerce every time
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
in the house every time we got a bill to
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
address this i said no
 
01:45:41.590 --> 01:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
two years in the house i said no
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
as chair of commerce in the senate
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
every time something like this would
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
come through i would say no
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:45:54.629 --> 01:45:54.639 align:start position:0%
i was listening to these people and i
 
01:45:57.030 --> 01:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
realized this problem's not going to go
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
away so i
 
01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
had drafted senate bill 324 and the
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:07.350 align:start position:0%
original bill
addressed

01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:09.189 align:start position:0%
addressed
addressed

01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
it addressed condos
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
and it in an addressed um
 
01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:20.629 align:start position:0%
and it in an addressed um
oh

01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:20.639 --> 01:46:23.109 align:start position:0%
 
co-ops

01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
co-ops
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
now when that bill came out it was the
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
bill that would
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
solve this problem it set up a state
 
01:46:36.149 --> 01:46:36.159 align:start position:0%
board to overview disputes
 
01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
it also brought out about 480 people
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
against the bill
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
and the women behind me
 
01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
for it
 
01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:47.590 align:start position:0%
for it
so

01:46:47.590 --> 01:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:49.590 --> 01:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
in other words it didn't go over too
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
well shall we say
 
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
so senator bradley using his wisdom
 
01:46:57.990 --> 01:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
said let's address what we can address
 
01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.109 align:start position:0%
said let's address what we can address
now

01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
that will make a difference and
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
therefore we have the bill that you have
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
works on condo associations and
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations
 
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
and uh the co-ops home homeowner co-ops
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
just because there's so many disputes
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
within these condo associations and
 
01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations are these
 
01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:32.229 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations are these
co-ops

01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
co-ops
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
requires these groups to have a dispute
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
resolution board
 
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
within their own unit
 
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
it's nothing run by the state which is
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
probably the way to do it
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
except it's not going to pass and no one
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
likes it except me and the people behind
 
01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:53.430 align:start position:0%
likes it except me and the people behind
me

01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
so i would like you to listen to what
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
these people have to say about it
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
why they need it
 
01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
and why you shouldn't listen to your
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
chairman when he tries to kill this
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much mr chair
 
01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's always a pleasure to see you too
 
01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
and how did it come out of the senate
 
01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:24.950 align:start position:0%
and how did it come out of the senate
committee

01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
this one
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
came out uh fairly well actually uh
 
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
looking here
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
why do you ask these questions
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
you know by now
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
it came out uh
 
01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
just say you'll get back to her later
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%

01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
if you look at the bill docket sheet

it'll be on there i just can't read it
 
01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
it's too small all right representative
 
01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:51.270 align:start position:0%
it's too small all right representative
burroughs

01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
burroughs
 
01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:52.229 align:start position:0%
burroughs
yeah

01:48:52.229 --> 01:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question senator
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
over here um one concern i have is the
 
01:48:59.910 --> 01:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
makeup of the resolution board
 
01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:00.870 align:start position:0%
makeup of the resolution board
because

01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the person
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
appointed by the bar
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's either the speaker of the
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
house or the governor which means that
 
01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
the majority party could have
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
the entire basically the entire board
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
and and um you know let's just say that
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's governor sherman
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
you're seeing that might be a problem to
 
01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
some people that governor sherman could
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
appoint all these people and the speaker
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
of the house so that's my concern that
 
01:49:31.510 --> 01:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
the majority party is going to control
 
01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:34.390 align:start position:0%
the majority party is going to control
that

01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:41.109 --> 01:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
evidently he's easy
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
from the community members
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
so i have one question for you i'll get
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
you i'll get them but i have a question
 
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
for you yes
 
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
did anybody consider that shouldn't we
 
01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:53.109 align:start position:0%
did anybody consider that shouldn't we
just

01:49:53.109 --> 01:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
require that any new condos a new
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
homeowner association anything going
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
forward any
 
01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
change in their bylaws it should have a
 
01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:04.639 align:start position:0%
statement in there about what exactly is
 
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
the grievance procedure of that
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
particular association
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair you know as well as i do
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
people don't read those
 
01:50:17.669 --> 01:50:17.679 align:start position:0%
i know and this was my argument the same
 
01:50:19.990 --> 01:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
is yours all along
 
01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:20.709 align:start position:0%
is yours all along
for

01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
six seven years i had the same argument
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
do your homework
 
01:50:27.589 --> 01:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't work
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
so this would settle it
 
01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:33.510 align:start position:0%
so this would settle it
okay

01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%

as well this is a
 
01:52:16.709 --> 01:52:16.719 align:start position:0%
i believe this will create a new board
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
that just handles disputes
 
01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:21.440 align:start position:0%

that it's a
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
separate dispute board as opposed to the
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
board of directors
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
it's open
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
these are all conversations these can be
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
changed and
 
01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:39.109 align:start position:0%

01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
association one which doesn't
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
occur with the manufactured housing
 
01:54:18.629 --> 01:54:18.639 align:start position:0%
parks there are already two
 
01:54:18.639 --> 01:54:19.669 align:start position:0%
parks there are already two
uh

01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
bodies that take very good care of those
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
in just about every situation that you
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
can can create
 
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
the first one was created by
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
representative senator judge
 
01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:35.350 align:start position:0%
representative senator judge
gordon

01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
gordon
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
who currently chairs
 
01:54:37.599 --> 01:54:38.470 align:start position:0%
who currently chairs
the

01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:54:39.990 --> 01:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
two small
 
01:54:42.070 --> 01:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
homeowners association
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
abramson forgot to say he wanted to add
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
an extra member
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
to to us so that we wouldn't have all of
 
01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
these perpetual quorum problems the
 
01:54:54.070 --> 01:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
senate having
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
removed someone and made us for people
 
01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:59.030 align:start position:0%
removed someone and made us for people
but

01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:01.510 align:start position:0%
but
um

01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:02.830 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:55:02.830 --> 01:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
um the housing
 
01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh the manufactured housing parks are
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
are on
 
01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:11.910 align:start position:0%
are on
overseen

01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
overseen
 
01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
by the manufactured housing board
 
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
does a very good job of this uh
 
01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:20.390 align:start position:0%
does a very good job of this uh
and

01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
most of the co-op manufactured housing
 
01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
parks the tenant-owned ones
 
01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:28.229 align:start position:0%
parks the tenant-owned ones
on

01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:55:28.239 --> 01:55:29.350 align:start position:0%
on
are

01:55:29.350 --> 01:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
on i think all of them probably
 
01:55:33.119 --> 01:55:34.070 align:start position:0%
on i think all of them probably
have

01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
guidance from the community loan fund
 
01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
for the duration of their lives
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
so um and that guidance has a lot it's
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
very heavily concentrated i think in
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
later years in making sure that
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
boards properly represent
 
01:55:54.239 --> 01:55:55.430 align:start position:0%
boards properly represent
the

01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
the owners
 
01:55:59.790 --> 01:55:59.800 align:start position:0%
and that there is a
 
01:56:02.470 --> 01:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
democratically elected board
 
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
and that people know what's going on
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
that doesn't
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
hasn't worked everywhere it didn't work
 
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
in one place and that was the genesis of
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
the opposition
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh to this bill but the opposition to
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
the to the original bill
 
01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh was aggravated by the fact that
 
01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:25.430 align:start position:0%
uh was aggravated by the fact that
on

01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
added to the bill were a lot of
 
01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
stipulations for homeowner associations
 
01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
the first of which in my mind is
 
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
something that no homeowner association
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
board and most of its membership
 
01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
would think was feasible at all
 
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
that is that every board
 
01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:51.350 align:start position:0%
that is that every board
see

01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:56:54.390 --> 01:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
every board rotate the entire membership
 
01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
of the association
 
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
through the board
 
01:57:01.030 --> 01:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
in two-year terms
 
01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:02.709 align:start position:0%
in two-year terms
on

01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
almost all
 
01:57:08.229 --> 01:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
partly or mostly second homeowners
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
they aren't around
 
01:57:14.159 --> 01:57:15.109 align:start position:0%
they aren't around
on

01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
in my small association we have a number
 
01:57:21.109 --> 01:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
of people who are physically or mentally
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
or both incapable
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
of doing that work
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
on and
 
01:57:27.119 --> 01:57:28.070 align:start position:0%
on and
won't

01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
won't
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
and several others that are very
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
very heavy workers
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of hospital people
 
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
on and
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
they find it very difficult
 
01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:40.870 align:start position:0%
they find it very difficult
uh

01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
to participate
 
01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
so there were a number of other
 
01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
stipulations which a number of
 
01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
homeownerizations associations because
 
01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
they vary a lot would find quite
 
01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:56.790 align:start position:0%
they vary a lot would find quite
difficult

01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people came out to oppose
 
01:58:01.270 --> 01:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:02.550 align:start position:0%
the bill
on

01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
the commission got a chance to look at
 
01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
it for i think it was 15 minutes while
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
we were discussing at the same time
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
and it was
 
01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:15.679 align:start position:0%
seven pages long something like that
 
01:58:15.679 --> 01:58:16.629 align:start position:0%
seven pages long something like that
so

01:58:16.629 --> 01:58:16.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
and we
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
we only discussed the possibility of
 
01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
amending it in the house once it came
 
01:58:23.199 --> 01:58:24.470 align:start position:0%
amending it in the house once it came
over

01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:25.589 align:start position:0%
over
so

01:58:25.589 --> 01:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
on i am here
 
01:58:31.990 --> 01:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
to ask you to itles bill
 
01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
so that we can can uh start with a clean
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
slate again next term
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:58:41.119 --> 01:58:42.790 align:start position:0%
on this
and

01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:45.270 --> 01:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
the chair doesn't like this idea much
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
but the biggest problem we have with the
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
condominium and the homeowner
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
associations is when
 
01:58:55.589 --> 01:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
the board
 
01:58:58.229 --> 01:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
with or without the property manager
 
01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
goes bad
 
01:59:03.990 --> 01:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
will not allow the owners to see the
 
01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
financial documents will not allow the
 
01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
owners to vote
 
01:59:11.189 --> 01:59:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh there are a fair number of boards
 
01:59:13.350 --> 01:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
that are self-perpetuating
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh over the years and a number of these
 
01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:18.790 align:start position:0%
uh over the years and a number of these
places

01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
places
 
01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
run into major financial problems
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
because of this kind of behavior too
 
01:59:25.270 --> 01:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
because they aren't properly doing
 
01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:26.870 align:start position:0%
because they aren't properly doing
maintenance

01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:28.709 align:start position:0%
maintenance
and

01:59:28.709 --> 01:59:28.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:30.390 --> 01:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
they get a reputation
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
around town for
 
01:59:32.719 --> 01:59:34.390 align:start position:0%
around town for
for

01:59:34.390 --> 01:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
discriminatory behavior
 
01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
and um the property values go down
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
and then people are faced with
 
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
do i sell
 
01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
i want to get out of here
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
do i sell
 
01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:50.709 align:start position:0%
do i sell
at

01:59:50.709 --> 01:59:50.719 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:59:52.870 --> 01:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
a bargain price to somebody who doesn't
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
know what's going on
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
a lot i've had people
 
02:00:02.070 --> 02:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh one couple it was in my association
 
02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:03.350 align:start position:0%
uh one couple it was in my association
that

02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:05.910 --> 02:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
a drunkard moved in next door that was
 
02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
very difficult for them they waited to
 
02:00:11.109 --> 02:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
sell until he had died
 
02:00:13.109 --> 02:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
because they were honest and they didn't
 
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:19.109 --> 02:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
something that we couldn't do anything
 
02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:20.639 align:start position:0%
about but
 
02:00:20.639 --> 02:00:22.310 align:start position:0%
about but
um

02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:23.350 align:start position:0%
um
but

02:00:23.350 --> 02:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:24.229 align:start position:0%
but
on

02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:00:27.109 --> 02:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
or do or are they trapped some people
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
walk away from these associations they
 
02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:30.470 align:start position:0%
walk away from these associations they
just

02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh crumble half the people have walked
 
02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:34.470 align:start position:0%
uh crumble half the people have walked
away

02:00:34.470 --> 02:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
away
 
02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:35.830 align:start position:0%
away
because

02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:36.870 align:start position:0%
because
they

02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:00:39.109 --> 02:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
they can afford to do it but a lot of
 
02:00:42.470 --> 02:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
other people move into these places
 
02:00:44.310 --> 02:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
as retirees
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
having calculated exactly how much they
 
02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
can afford
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
for their housing for the rest of their
 
02:00:55.669 --> 02:00:55.679 align:start position:0%
life and can't afford to move away
 
02:00:55.679 --> 02:00:56.790 align:start position:0%
life and can't afford to move away
so

02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
we do need something this is not it this
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
is what we are doing now
 
02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
except that it adds an extra step which
 
02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.189 align:start position:0%
except that it adds an extra step which
is

02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:01:11.189 --> 02:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
for the people that
 
02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
have decided that the board is doing
 
02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:14.709 align:start position:0%
have decided that the board is doing
wrong

02:01:14.709 --> 02:01:14.719 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
02:01:17.350 --> 02:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
to ask for a meeting with that board and
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
have the board tell them they don't care
 
02:01:21.030 --> 02:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
because they've already been doing that
 
02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
and then they can after that they can go
 
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:29.679 align:start position:0%
to the superior court which is the only
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
place they can go now
 
02:01:34.470 --> 02:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
and that takes at least two years of
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
waiting and
 
02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not talking about pandemic time i'm
 
02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
talking about pre-pandemic
 
02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
and it used to be 20 000 it's probably
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
more than that now
 
02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
to get yourself through this
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
so it it very rarely happens things just
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
crumble or people
 
02:01:56.629 --> 02:01:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:58.950 --> 02:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
or they sell to we've had a couple of
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
people come to us because
 
02:02:03.030 --> 02:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
they'd bought something they thought was
 
02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
great and then it wasn't
 
02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:08.709 align:start position:0%
great and then it wasn't
so

02:02:08.709 --> 02:02:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:08.719 --> 02:02:10.709 align:start position:0%
 
also

02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:02:14.310 --> 02:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
the homeowners associations there is no
 
02:02:19.589 --> 02:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
definition in the rsas of a homeowners
 
02:02:19.599 --> 02:02:21.270 align:start position:0%
definition in the rsas of a homeowners
association

02:02:21.270 --> 02:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:02:24.149 --> 02:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
so you need to provide one if you pass
 
02:02:24.159 --> 02:02:25.510 align:start position:0%
so you need to provide one if you pass
this

02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
and um that's all i had to say and i'm
 
02:02:29.910 --> 02:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
sorry it took a bit more than two
 
02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:32.310 align:start position:0%
sorry it took a bit more than two
minutes

02:02:32.310 --> 02:02:32.320 align:start position:0%

so
 
02:03:25.589 --> 02:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
on it
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's the existing board
 
02:03:31.669 --> 02:03:31.679 align:start position:0%
that is supposed to hear the case about
 
02:03:34.629 --> 02:03:34.639 align:start position:0%
why there is a problem with the existing
 
02:03:34.639 --> 02:03:37.669 align:start position:0%
why there is a problem with the existing
board

02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
follow it please for the question may

inquire thank you
 
02:03:43.109 --> 02:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
um the senator who introduced this
 
02:03:45.109 --> 02:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
indicated that there is a possibility of
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
making change do you think that if it
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
were a dispute board as opposed to the
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
board of directors of the association
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
that that would strengthen the spill
 
02:03:57.270 --> 02:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of smaller homeowner
 
02:03:59.430 --> 02:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
associations and co and condo
 
02:04:02.470 --> 02:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
associations i know one that's only four
 
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
on you can't put fit two boards into
 
02:04:07.270 --> 02:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
those places but
 
02:04:10.950 --> 02:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh and it's it's difficult i mean you're
 
02:04:14.069 --> 02:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
talking about volunteers
 
02:04:15.669 --> 02:04:15.679 align:start position:0%
doing what
 
02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
town and city governments do
 
02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
and smaller towns have problems getting
 
02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
volunteers to be clerk and things like
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%

02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%

02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
proposed was a solution in search of a
 
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
problem that doesn't really exist to any
 
02:06:13.189 --> 02:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
great degree
 
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
that would warrant creating another
 
02:06:18.310 --> 02:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
government board and more bureaucracy
 
02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's important to note
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
i regress to say there are 265 thousand
 
02:06:27.430 --> 02:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
approximately residents who live in
 
02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
condominiums in new hampshire in
 
02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
approximately 107 000 homes in 2200
 
02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:35.430 align:start position:0%
approximately 107 000 homes in 2200
associations

02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
associations
 
02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:36.310 align:start position:0%
associations
please

02:06:36.310 --> 02:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
take note i'm speaking in favor of it
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative almi is speaking against
 
02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:42.229 align:start position:0%
representative almi is speaking against
it

02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:06:44.950 --> 02:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
that tells you the extent of the problem
 
02:06:48.550 --> 02:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
there is a very limited problem
 
02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
the amended bill provides additional
 
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
protection for unit owners if there is a
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
runaway board a runaway board president
 
02:07:01.510 --> 02:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
who refuses to meet with the unit owner
 
02:07:04.870 --> 02:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
who has an issue this bill compels them
 
02:07:06.069 --> 02:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
if they fail to do it then this gives
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
that unit owner if necessary additional
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
evidence to bring before a superior
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
court judge to say we have exhausted
 
02:07:20.790 --> 02:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
every effort and the association refuses
 
02:07:23.189 --> 02:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
to meet with us i think this is a
 
02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
reasonable compromise the unit owner
 
02:07:28.950 --> 02:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
has to be responded to with a meeting
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
within 30 days and the board has to be
 
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
responded respond to them in 30 days so
 
02:07:37.589 --> 02:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
it gives a clear trail for the unit
 
02:07:41.109 --> 02:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
owner if in fact they're being abused
 
02:07:43.270 --> 02:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
if the parties don't come to a mutually
 
02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
acceptable resolution they can still
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
bring the issue
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
before a court of competent jurisdiction
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
i believe the
 
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
amended bill is a reasonable compromise
 
02:07:58.390 --> 02:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
that will move the process of belong if
 
02:08:01.030 --> 02:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
something does exist without the state's
 
02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
interference or expense
 
02:08:05.910 --> 02:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
keep in mind if there was as proposed
 
02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:06.950 align:start position:0%
keep in mind if there was as proposed
before

02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
a board created people from all over the
 
02:08:11.910 --> 02:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
state would have to come they would have
 
02:08:13.350 --> 02:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
to pay a fee
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
either side in that dispute would end up
 
02:08:20.550 --> 02:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
appealing it to the superior court and
 
02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
it would cost double the amount of money
 
02:08:24.790 --> 02:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
this provides
 
02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
local control over a locally uh elected
 
02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
board and provides the unit owner a
 
02:08:34.149 --> 02:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
relief if they feel they're being abused
 
02:08:36.550 --> 02:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
and provides the material of that relief
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
if the matter has to be taken
 
02:08:42.149 --> 02:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
for it i ask you to find this bill
 
02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
good to legislate and move it forward to
 
02:08:47.430 --> 02:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
the entire house thank you
 
02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
great thank you any questions from the
 
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative van halen
 
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to follow up in my earlier
 
02:08:55.910 --> 02:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
questioning uh is it your interpretation
 
02:08:57.510 --> 02:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
that there would be a separate dispute
 
02:08:58.870 --> 02:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
board separate from the board of
 
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
directors to whom someone would bring a
 
02:09:03.669 --> 02:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
concern no
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's not how the language is written
 
02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
in the board and on that point i agree
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
with representative elmi uh there are
 
02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
not huge some of these associations in
 
02:09:16.069 --> 02:09:16.079 align:start position:0%
new hampshire are very small and to
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
create an additional board would be a
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
cumbersome issue and i don't see any
 
02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
need i think though this board forces
 
02:09:26.709 --> 02:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
the association if for some reason a
 
02:09:29.109 --> 02:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
board member or any board refuses to
 
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
meet this compels them to do it and it
 
02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
will be in the governing documents of
 
02:09:36.629 --> 02:09:36.639 align:start position:0%
the association that they have to amend
 
02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
their bylaws accordingly
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
follow a place follow-up question just
 
02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
the same the same line of questioning
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
that i've asked the earlier
 
02:09:47.589 --> 02:09:47.599 align:start position:0%
people who have testified
 
02:09:50.550 --> 02:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
so in essence with this bill and i
 
02:09:53.189 --> 02:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
should clarify i am a condominium owner
 
02:09:55.830 --> 02:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
and occupant and i have served on boards
 
02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
in other states
 
02:09:59.109 --> 02:09:59.119 align:start position:0%
um but i'm not speaking for myself i'm
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
speaking about the experiences that i've
 
02:10:01.119 --> 02:10:02.229 align:start position:0%
speaking about the experiences that i've
seen

02:10:02.229 --> 02:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
seen
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
based upon the idea that the complainant
 
02:10:07.350 --> 02:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
would go to the condominium board of i'm
 
02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
using condominium but it's i know it's
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
more extensive
 
02:10:12.229 --> 02:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
the claimant the complainant would go to
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
the condominium board that currently
 
02:10:14.159 --> 02:10:15.350 align:start position:0%
the condominium board that currently
exists

02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
exists
 
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
that that currently
 
02:10:19.350 --> 02:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
if if i have a concern
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
and i i don't get any kind of recourse
 
02:10:23.430 --> 02:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
from the condominium board of directors
 
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
and i go to them they're the same people
 
02:10:27.830 --> 02:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
that i have a complaint against can i
 
02:10:29.669 --> 02:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
expect to get a resolution that's fair
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
and just i think you can i think most
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
people on boards are there for the right
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
reasons i think there are very remote
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
situations where that may not be the
 
02:10:43.589 --> 02:10:43.599 align:start position:0%
case i deal with many boards i serve on
 
02:10:47.030 --> 02:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
boards myself and i think in most cases
 
02:10:48.870 --> 02:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
they will i
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
have heard of cases where a board
 
02:10:53.589 --> 02:10:53.599 align:start position:0%
refuses to meet and they say we're just
 
02:10:56.470 --> 02:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
not doing it and i think this bill
 
02:10:58.629 --> 02:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
corrects that issue because if they
 
02:11:01.109 --> 02:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
don't meet they're violating
 
02:11:03.109 --> 02:11:03.119 align:start position:0%
both the letter and the spirit of the
 
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
law and i think that puts them in a very
 
02:11:08.709 --> 02:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
difficult position if the unit owner
 
02:11:10.709 --> 02:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
decides to bring it to the superior
 
02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
court so i think it serves a significant
 
02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
purpose without creating more laws and
 
02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
more infrastructure for people to pay
 
02:11:24.390 --> 02:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
more money to go to so i think this is a
 
02:11:26.950 --> 02:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
relief that wasn't there that will be
 
02:11:29.910 --> 02:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you uh
 
02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
so i have uh
 
02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:37.599 align:start position:0%
that looks uh familiar to me uh bonnie
 
02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
galore's and
 
02:11:39.599 --> 02:11:41.109 align:start position:0%

ripcon

02:11:42.550 --> 02:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
ripcon
 
02:11:46.709 --> 02:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:48.390 --> 02:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't remember your name already but
 
02:11:50.069 --> 02:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
i guess something nobody can spell my
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
name that's what the good spot is today
 
02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:53.030 align:start position:0%
name that's what the good spot is today
okay

02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:11:55.830 --> 02:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
so uh so you got one of you wrote five
 
02:11:57.350 --> 02:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
minutes the other one bites so hopefully
 
02:11:59.109 --> 02:11:59.119 align:start position:0%
you'll you get that
 
02:12:01.109 --> 02:12:01.119 align:start position:0%
we we have heard this issue many many
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
times before in this committee this
 
02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
obviously is a new version a new
 
02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
solution so i guess if you can focus on
 
02:12:09.510 --> 02:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
why this one is
 
02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
why this one is so great that would be
 
02:12:11.199 --> 02:12:13.109 align:start position:0%
why this one is so great that would be
good

02:12:13.109 --> 02:12:13.119 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon gentlemen
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
as you know my name is bonnie gories and
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
i'm here today representing myself
 
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
louise wrightout and john murphy from
 
02:12:22.470 --> 02:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
bfu crossing cooperative in allenstown
 
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
and he could not be here with us today
 
02:12:28.950 --> 02:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
as you know we are in favor of sb 324 we
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
need a mechanism within each cooperative
 
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
to handle complaints relative to the
 
02:12:35.189 --> 02:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
bylaw violations whether the violations
 
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
are tenants of the cooperative or
 
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
members of the board
 
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
if a resolution cannot be reached at the
 
02:12:42.870 --> 02:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
cooperative level the tenant still has
 
02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
the ability to challenge the issue at
 
02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
the superior court in our community and
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
many others complaints are not addressed
 
02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
by the boards
 
02:12:53.589 --> 02:12:53.599 align:start position:0%
leaving we as residents without a voice
 
02:12:54.870 --> 02:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
the bill is a step in the right
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
direction to protect our rights and
 
02:12:58.950 --> 02:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
interests of the tenants in all resident
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
owned communities
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:13:04.709 --> 02:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
louise i was a model of brevity thank
 
02:13:04.719 --> 02:13:05.669 align:start position:0%
louise i was a model of brevity thank
you

02:13:05.669 --> 02:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
that was very brief thank you
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:14.149 --> 02:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:13:17.030 --> 02:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
hi my name is louise rideout and
 
02:13:19.350 --> 02:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
i live at bearview crossing cooperative
 
02:13:20.709 --> 02:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
in allenstown
 
02:13:22.709 --> 02:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
and you're right the last time was a lot
 
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of testimony this time the revised
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
edition i understand that
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
the concern of not having a separate
 
02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.030 align:start position:0%
the concern of not having a separate
board

02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:13:33.589 --> 02:13:33.599 align:start position:0%
but we really don't want it to be where
 
02:13:34.629 --> 02:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
we're so
 
02:13:36.629 --> 02:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
like controlled by everything it should
 
02:13:38.550 --> 02:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
be something that responsible adults can
 
02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
take care of but unfortunately that
 
02:13:42.149 --> 02:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't always happen
 
02:13:44.550 --> 02:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
so some type of a guideline is is very
 
02:13:47.109 --> 02:13:47.119 align:start position:0%
good and it's important because
 
02:13:48.550 --> 02:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know you know you might have a board
 
02:13:50.709 --> 02:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
that you can work with or you might have
 
02:13:53.270 --> 02:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
a board that you can't work with like
 
02:13:54.790 --> 02:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
two months ago one of them i think it
 
02:13:56.790 --> 02:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
was two months ago at a meeting one of
 
02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
our zoom meetings um the community loan
 
02:13:58.800 --> 02:13:59.990 align:start position:0%
our zoom meetings um the community loan
fund

02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh tech representative alan blake he's
 
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
he addressed the meeting by saying
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
five people
 
02:14:08.390 --> 02:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
which we have five members of the board
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
can't run the park
 
02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:10.629 align:start position:0%
can't run the park
so

02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:13.669 --> 02:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
in that regards you have to understand
 
02:14:15.830 --> 02:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's happened sometimes
 
02:14:17.910 --> 02:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
so to have this in place for us if we
 
02:14:20.069 --> 02:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
need it it's important it's not
 
02:14:22.709 --> 02:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
frivolous it's you know it's important
 
02:14:24.550 --> 02:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
to have a separate resolution board
 
02:14:26.470 --> 02:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
would be nice but if we can't do that
 
02:14:28.470 --> 02:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
we're adults we're homeowners or adults
 
02:14:30.149 --> 02:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
we should be able to
 
02:14:31.910 --> 02:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know get things done
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
one thing i would really like to
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
address is that
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
this bill as it states about the bylaws
 
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
our when we became a co-op three years
 
02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:43.910 align:start position:0%
our when we became a co-op three years
ago

02:14:43.910 --> 02:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:14:46.470 --> 02:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
02:14:48.229 --> 02:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
we use the templates of the community
 
02:14:49.510 --> 02:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
loan fund
 
02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
we were
 
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
it was kind of like this is what would
 
02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
work best for you and at some point
 
02:14:58.709 --> 02:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
we tried to adopt different bylaws which
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of opposition against
 
02:15:02.709 --> 02:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
bylaws that would probably better suit
 
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
our own community
 
02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
so that didn't help a little bit the one
 
02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
thing that i would hope that this would
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
address too is that you wouldn't have
 
02:15:11.910 --> 02:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
third-party entities like
 
02:15:14.310 --> 02:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
community loan fund or anybody else that
 
02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
would want to
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
you know sway
 
02:15:18.390 --> 02:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
the board
 
02:15:20.550 --> 02:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
and have the board maybe um
 
02:15:22.709 --> 02:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
adopt what they want instead of what is
 
02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
best for the community
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
and when that happens it really causes a
 
02:15:30.069 --> 02:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
lot of problems for the homeowners
 
02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
because now you have a board that could
 
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
be influenced by outside people
 
02:15:36.629 --> 02:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
telling them that you know you should do
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
it this way you should do it that way
 
02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
you know get rid of this person get rid
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
of that person instead of us being able
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
to have this so this is really something
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
that can protect people
 
02:15:49.589 --> 02:15:49.599 align:start position:0%
who are being targeted and you know
 
02:15:51.189 --> 02:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
having the board
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
some boards in place being swayed by
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
outside parties which i don't think
 
02:15:57.750 --> 02:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
should be it should be right in within
 
02:15:59.589 --> 02:15:59.599 align:start position:0%
our own community and our own we should
 
02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
be adults and be able to handle it
 
02:16:03.510 --> 02:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
without any interference from any other
 
02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:04.629 align:start position:0%
without any interference from any other
sources

02:16:04.629 --> 02:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
sources
 
02:16:06.709 --> 02:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
i thank you for listening
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
i just i i want to just say something
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
about what you just said and louise is
 
02:16:13.189 --> 02:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
that louise is absolutely right
 
02:16:13.199 --> 02:16:14.870 align:start position:0%
that louise is absolutely right
um

02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:17.350 --> 02:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
we don't need anybody to sway the board
 
02:16:19.830 --> 02:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
that that that's in place right now
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
you have people on the board who might
 
02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
not like louise who might not like me
 
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
and we have to bring something up to
 
02:16:26.950 --> 02:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
them we're not going to get anything do
 
02:16:28.709 --> 02:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
you know what i'm trying to say yep we
 
02:16:33.030 --> 02:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
we had um for instance last last year we
 
02:16:34.950 --> 02:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
had someone sitting on the board that
 
02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
was not following the bylaws and tried
 
02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:37.910 align:start position:0%
was not following the bylaws and tried
to

02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
take five people out off the membership
 
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
and then throw them out of the park
 
02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:43.589 align:start position:0%
and then throw them out of the park
that

02:16:43.589 --> 02:16:43.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:45.429 --> 02:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
that that was not right they did not
 
02:16:47.429 --> 02:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
follow the bylaws the people that were
 
02:16:49.830 --> 02:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
in place on that board did absolutely
 
02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
nothing a technical adviser didn't do
 
02:16:53.429 --> 02:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
anything to advise him that what they
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
were doing was incorrect
 
02:16:57.589 --> 02:16:57.599 align:start position:0%
so consequently these we had five
 
02:16:59.429 --> 02:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
tenants that were
 
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
beside himself because he said well
 
02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
where are we going to go we own this
 
02:17:03.270 --> 02:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
house now we're going to get evicted
 
02:17:05.349 --> 02:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
because i've got a moped sitting on my
 
02:17:05.359 --> 02:17:07.030 align:start position:0%
because i've got a moped sitting on my
lawn

02:17:07.030 --> 02:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
lawn
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
do you know what i'm trying to say so we
 
02:17:11.910 --> 02:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
we need protection ourselves
 
02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:17:15.509 --> 02:17:15.519 align:start position:0%
not everybody's personality matches
 
02:17:16.950 --> 02:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
not everybody's going to agree with
 
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
everybody else but when you have a board
 
02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
in place
 
02:17:23.030 --> 02:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
that has issues with people in the park
 
02:17:24.150 --> 02:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
you're not going to you're going not
 
02:17:26.709 --> 02:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
going to get fair decision from them
 
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative greeson has a question
 
02:17:30.389 --> 02:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you ladies
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
for for coming for us again you are in
 
02:17:36.150 --> 02:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
support of this bill yes sir okay
 
02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:38.389 align:start position:0%
support of this bill yes sir okay
uh

02:17:38.389 --> 02:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
as i read this there is nothing to
 
02:17:40.559 --> 02:17:41.669 align:start position:0%
as i read this there is nothing to
protect

02:17:41.669 --> 02:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
protect
 
02:17:43.669 --> 02:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
the owner
 
02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
from retribution for having sued
 
02:17:48.549 --> 02:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
if it goes to that so they can't get
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
satisfaction at the
 
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
at the board level at the park or the
 
02:17:56.870 --> 02:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
condo association they have to sue
 
02:17:58.629 --> 02:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing to protect them
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
against retribution against this
 
02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
against the owner
 
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
even if it's if it's satisfactory
 
02:18:05.910 --> 02:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of the outcome of that suit
 
02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
for or against
 
02:18:10.389 --> 02:18:10.399 align:start position:0%

i've only lived here for a year and a

half
 
02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:41.750 align:start position:0%
half
um

02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
i took all the money that the va gave me
 
02:19:46.309 --> 02:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
after fighting to make my husband a
 
02:19:48.549 --> 02:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
service-related disability i left my

to live a nice peaceful life
 
02:19:54.870 --> 02:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
let me tell you when i have to keep my
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
curtains closed during the day and i
 
02:19:59.110 --> 02:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
have to buy security cameras because my
 
02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
people in my park are targeting me
 
02:20:04.469 --> 02:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
because people on the
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
we'll just leave it like that but i'm
 
02:20:10.309 --> 02:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much i have a yeah
 
02:20:14.550 --> 02:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
oh representative has a question i'm
 
02:20:16.309 --> 02:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you mr chair um thank you
 
02:20:17.910 --> 02:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question can you go to
 
02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
superior court now
 
02:20:22.630 --> 02:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
no we don't have any recourse right now
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:30.070 --> 02:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
we can talk offline but their issue was
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
what the way the transaction occurred
 
02:20:36.309 --> 02:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
because i just would would you believe
 
02:20:39.190 --> 02:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
i've been to superior court with condo
 
02:20:41.429 --> 02:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
owners who have been targeted
 
02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
it does happen
 
02:20:45.750 --> 02:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
often yes it does often
 
02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
and um we went to superior court
 
02:20:50.950 --> 02:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
to challenge the board
 
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
and uh they won but they had to spend
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars
 
02:20:58.230 --> 02:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
you know what and and i can understand
 
02:21:01.750 --> 02:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
that but in some in some instances
 
02:21:04.550 --> 02:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
like for louise and myself who are
 
02:21:07.030 --> 02:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
targeted again um
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
to me it would be beneficial because
 
02:21:10.630 --> 02:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
somebody has to stand up for what's
 
02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:12.150 align:start position:0%
somebody has to stand up for what's
right

02:21:12.150 --> 02:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:21:14.630 --> 02:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
but they also also it would cause a
 
02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
burden if you are bringing you know to
 
02:21:21.190 --> 02:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
go to superior court if you're bringing
 
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
anything against the board in your co-op
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
it would eventually cost money and
 
02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:27.750 align:start position:0%
it would eventually cost money and
and

02:21:27.750 --> 02:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:30.150 --> 02:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
it would teach people like hey you got
 
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing and be ethical but
 
02:21:33.830 --> 02:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
on the other hand
 
02:21:35.590 --> 02:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know my neighbors we're not we're
 
02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
not wealthy people we're all like
 
02:21:39.349 --> 02:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
regular people but but there has to be
 
02:21:41.349 --> 02:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
some accountability i totally agree with
 
02:21:43.110 --> 02:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
accountability because if you don't have
 
02:21:43.120 --> 02:21:43.990 align:start position:0%
accountability because if you don't have
any

02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
and people the boards run wrong they do
 
02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:47.510 align:start position:0%
and people the boards run wrong they do
and

02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:49.349 --> 02:21:49.359 align:start position:0%
the issues that we have
 
02:21:50.710 --> 02:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
of people
 
02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
running rogue and
 
02:21:54.389 --> 02:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
they're very it's very right now you're
 
02:21:56.070 --> 02:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
right about the money even if you go
 
02:21:57.510 --> 02:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
forward we're missing so much money
 
02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
anyway so if you go forward i mean it it
 
02:22:01.990 --> 02:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
might actually make people accountable
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for sharing thank
 
02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:05.280 align:start position:0%

02:22:06.870 --> 02:22:06.880 align:start position:0%

02:22:08.469 --> 02:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
we're missing a lot of money anyway
 
02:22:10.150 --> 02:22:10.160 align:start position:0%

you have to turn your that little yep
 
02:22:59.429 --> 02:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
perfect i just want to say that this
 
02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
bill i mean i haven't lived in a co-op
 
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
i've always owned my own property so
 
02:23:07.830 --> 02:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
when we moved here my husband and i
 
02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
he wasn't feeling good so we figured
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
this would be a nice community to live
 
02:23:13.429 --> 02:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
in but what i'm finding out and i was on
 
02:23:15.750 --> 02:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
the board for only eight months because
 
02:23:17.750 --> 02:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
i was the first person
 
02:23:19.990 --> 02:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
to be different from the man that's been
 
02:23:22.230 --> 02:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
running it for 11 years
 
02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
and in the eight months
 
02:23:25.510 --> 02:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
every month
 
02:23:27.429 --> 02:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
i had issues because he would stand
 
02:23:29.830 --> 02:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
outside because he wasn't on the board
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
and tell everybody to come in and
 
02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
complain to us about what we were doing
 
02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:34.550 align:start position:0%
complain to us about what we were doing
wrong

02:23:34.550 --> 02:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
i've never been on a board before and i
 
02:23:39.190 --> 02:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
said that right off the bat that i knew
 
02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
what this i'm willing to learn
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
but it was constant
 
02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
every month and finally after every
 
02:23:47.990 --> 02:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
eight months they put a petition on me
 
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
because and my whole board
 
02:23:53.910 --> 02:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
that uh they wanted us off the board
 
02:23:55.590 --> 02:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
because we weren't doing things their
 
02:23:55.600 --> 02:23:56.550 align:start position:0%
because we weren't doing things their
way

02:23:56.550 --> 02:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:23:58.790 --> 02:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
now as of this day
 
02:24:00.950 --> 02:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
pretty much four of them are still on
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
the board
 
02:24:04.870 --> 02:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
as and this was three years ago
 
02:24:06.309 --> 02:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
so they're all back on the board what
 
02:24:09.510 --> 02:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
they want but what i'm saying is
 
02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
the our board anyway
 
02:24:14.950 --> 02:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
is uh if i like you you can do this but
 
02:24:16.870 --> 02:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
if you i don't like you it can be the
 
02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
same thing as my friend and you're not
 
02:24:19.830 --> 02:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
gonna do it
 
02:24:22.469 --> 02:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
and it's constant constant
 
02:24:24.309 --> 02:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
you know i mean
 
02:24:26.309 --> 02:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
the one of the man that i talk about a
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
lot of times he asks for a lot of our
 
02:24:30.870 --> 02:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
issues with our people in the park
 
02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
you know with neighborly issues because
 
02:24:34.710 --> 02:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
he he tells one neighbor one thing he
 
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
tells the other neighbor to sing you
 
02:24:37.750 --> 02:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
know a different thing and so that
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
causes conflict
 
02:24:40.950 --> 02:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
from neighbor to neighbor i'm just
 
02:24:42.389 --> 02:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
saying i think
 
02:24:44.870 --> 02:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
that the board needs more accountability
 
02:24:47.590 --> 02:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
because they don't follow the bylaws or
 
02:24:50.389 --> 02:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
our rules they they make up their own
 
02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
they feel
 
02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
that that's and half of them don't know
 
02:24:56.150 --> 02:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
what the bylaws and rules are so they
 
02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
don't even read them before they go in
 
02:25:00.630 --> 02:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
so i think this will help if they they
 
02:25:03.270 --> 02:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
need accountability and we need be able
 
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
to have a voice
 
02:25:06.550 --> 02:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
because you go to them and they just
 
02:25:09.429 --> 02:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
shrug it off like you're just i mean
 
02:25:11.990 --> 02:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
we've been my husband and i
 
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
anybody that speaks with us is targeted
 
02:25:16.150 --> 02:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
they won't talk to them
 
02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
i've had a new neighbor that moved in
 
02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
across the street
 
02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
they will not associate because they
 
02:25:23.910 --> 02:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
they talk to my husband and i because
 
02:25:25.510 --> 02:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
they call us the troublemakers because
 
02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
we did put up we started with um karen
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
susan and senator french
 
02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
and i mean so we are the biggest
 
02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
troublemakers in the park because we
 
02:25:37.590 --> 02:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
went ahead
 
02:25:39.750 --> 02:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
and silvia because she she made
 
02:25:42.150 --> 02:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
headlines in our little paper so she's a
 
02:25:43.590 --> 02:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
big target
 
02:25:46.550 --> 02:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you very much but i i
 
02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
approve i wish this bill would go
 
02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
through some kind of help for us great
 
02:25:53.910 --> 02:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:55.750 --> 02:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:25:59.030 --> 02:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
i agree everything debbie said was true
 
02:26:03.510 --> 02:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
the only thing i have to add is that
 
02:26:06.710 --> 02:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
we did try to get a lawyer
 
02:26:08.550 --> 02:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
because of all the
 
02:26:10.469 --> 02:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
conflicts in that
 
02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
and they didn't want any part of us
 
02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
and i think it's because of this
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
gentleman this he's not a gentleman
 
02:26:21.510 --> 02:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
this person that's causing the truth
 
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
he's been a president and everything
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
else for ye 11 years
 
02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:28.070 align:start position:0%
else for ye 11 years
and

02:26:28.070 --> 02:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:31.670 --> 02:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
sadly he's my neighbor
 
02:26:35.590 --> 02:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
so that doesn't tell that matters but
 
02:26:38.550 --> 02:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
what i want to say is we do need help
 
02:26:41.349 --> 02:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
someplace we couldn't get it from work
 
02:26:43.590 --> 02:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
we couldn't get it from lawyers we
 
02:26:45.990 --> 02:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
didn't know where to turn
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
until we called
 
02:26:51.990 --> 02:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
harold for french and karen
 
02:26:55.030 --> 02:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
and that's where we got started
 
02:26:59.270 --> 02:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
to get some help but it's it's a shame
 
02:27:00.309 --> 02:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
that you
 
02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
live in a place that you have four or
 
02:27:06.469 --> 02:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
five people dominating everything
 
02:27:08.550 --> 02:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
they want lately
 
02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
this last this existing board
 
02:27:13.270 --> 02:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
will not
 
02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
tell you anything
 
02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
and they they
 
02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
didn't have meetings for four months in
 
02:27:21.510 --> 02:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
a row
 
02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:22.389 align:start position:0%
a row
and

02:27:22.389 --> 02:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:27:25.750 --> 02:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
one one said to me and from another
 
02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:26.630 align:start position:0%
one one said to me and from another
board

02:27:26.630 --> 02:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:27:29.349 --> 02:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
if you don't like it leave
 
02:27:31.510 --> 02:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
which is very nice
 
02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:32.309 align:start position:0%
which is very nice
and

02:27:32.309 --> 02:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:27:34.469 --> 02:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
she was the same as
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
this fellow on the board that just gives
 
02:27:39.190 --> 02:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
you trouble after trouble
 
02:27:42.230 --> 02:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
he doesn't like me
 
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
because i will answer him back
 
02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:47.030 align:start position:0%
because i will answer him back
and

02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
most people are afraid to answer him
 
02:27:53.349 --> 02:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
and so naturally being neighbors we have
 
02:27:53.359 --> 02:27:54.950 align:start position:0%
and so naturally being neighbors we have
conflicts

02:27:54.950 --> 02:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
conflicts
 
02:27:58.309 --> 02:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
so the other day i get a phone call and
 
02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's for the president of the board
 
02:28:03.030 --> 02:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
telling me
 
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
if i don't stop
 
02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
harassing a lot of people
 
02:28:11.910 --> 02:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
i didn't know i knew that many people
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
but he uh
 
02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
she said you will be disciplined
 
02:28:19.830 --> 02:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
and you will be
 
02:28:22.630 --> 02:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
warned i warn you right now
 
02:28:26.790 --> 02:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
you will be losing your membership
 
02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:28.230 align:start position:0%
you will be losing your membership
so

02:28:28.230 --> 02:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:30.710 --> 02:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not afraid of it because
 
02:28:33.190 --> 02:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
i have gotten a hold of the
 
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
local paper
 
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
and they will be hearing about this
 
02:28:39.270 --> 02:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
and she's
 
02:28:43.030 --> 02:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
the the writer isn't agree with me
 
02:28:46.469 --> 02:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
to have another article in the paper
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
and the president of our board
 
02:28:52.150 --> 02:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely will
 
02:28:54.710 --> 02:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
be mad as heck because
 
02:28:57.429 --> 02:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
she left the board
 
02:29:00.550 --> 02:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
the same day the first
 
02:29:03.429 --> 02:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
article came out
 
02:29:07.270 --> 02:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
so i mean what does that say you know
 
02:29:09.349 --> 02:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
but another thing we don't trust this
 
02:29:12.230 --> 02:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
man at all as far as our money goes
 
02:29:14.389 --> 02:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
with the park
 
02:29:18.309 --> 02:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
he is charging 20 to 25
 
02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
for every contract he
 
02:29:24.790 --> 02:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
makes so that's costing us the members
 
02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
more money
 
02:29:30.870 --> 02:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
but he denies well he's a perpetual liar
 
02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:32.070 align:start position:0%
but he denies well he's a perpetual liar
anyways

02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
and he denies everything
 
02:29:37.270 --> 02:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
so you can't win with them and
 
02:29:41.670 --> 02:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
i just we need help that's what we need

so sorry about the delay
 
03:31:15.990 --> 03:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll open up the public
 
03:31:18.790 --> 03:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
hearing uh senate bill 286
 
03:31:21.110 --> 03:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
establishing an association health plan
 
03:31:23.990 --> 03:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
pilot program
 
03:31:25.670 --> 03:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
good morning senator
 
03:31:28.229 --> 03:31:28.239 align:start position:0%

03:31:34.070 --> 03:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
nine
 
03:31:36.150 --> 03:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
and i uh before i
 
03:31:37.670 --> 03:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
read what i prepared
 
03:31:39.510 --> 03:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that was really
 
03:31:42.150 --> 03:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
just pulled michael a little closer oh
 
03:31:44.469 --> 03:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was concerning me
 
03:31:45.670 --> 03:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
is our
 
03:31:47.670 --> 03:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
high health care premiums that we all
 
03:31:47.680 --> 03:31:48.550 align:start position:0%
high health care premiums that we all
pay

03:31:48.550 --> 03:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
pay
 
03:31:50.630 --> 03:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
i wanted to come up with a strategy that
 
03:31:52.070 --> 03:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
could help all the people in new
 
03:31:52.080 --> 03:31:53.429 align:start position:0%
could help all the people in new
hampshire

03:31:53.429 --> 03:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:31:53.439 --> 03:31:54.389 align:start position:0%
hampshire
and

03:31:54.389 --> 03:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:31:55.510 --> 03:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's a little
 
03:31:57.269 --> 03:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
difficult trying to go
 
03:31:59.750 --> 03:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
straight forwards with the department of
 
03:32:02.150 --> 03:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
insurance so i opted to do a pilot to
 
03:32:05.030 --> 03:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
give it a a good run so i'll read for
 
03:32:06.790 --> 03:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
you what i prepared
 
03:32:09.110 --> 03:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
senate bill 286 would direct the
 
03:32:11.110 --> 03:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
department of insurance to set up a
 
03:32:13.990 --> 03:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
pilot program for the establishment of
 
03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
association health plans the high cost
 
03:32:18.790 --> 03:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
of health insurance is a burden for
 
03:32:20.950 --> 03:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
families across the country and the new
 
03:32:22.309 --> 03:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire and new hampshire
 
03:32:24.469 --> 03:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we face some of the
 
03:32:24.479 --> 03:32:25.429 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we face some of the
highest

03:32:25.429 --> 03:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
highest
 
03:32:28.469 --> 03:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
health insurance premiums in the nation
 
03:32:30.550 --> 03:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
these high costs not only hurt our
 
03:32:32.550 --> 03:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
families but make it harder for new
 
03:32:35.190 --> 03:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire companies to attract employees
 
03:32:38.150 --> 03:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
and help our state's economy thrive
 
03:32:40.389 --> 03:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
we have tried top-down washington
 
03:32:42.229 --> 03:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
solutions to make health care more
 
03:32:44.630 --> 03:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
affordable they don't work
 
03:32:47.190 --> 03:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
we need to bring more choice and more
 
03:32:49.590 --> 03:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
competition to our health insurance
 
03:32:49.600 --> 03:32:51.110 align:start position:0%
competition to our health insurance
marketplace

03:32:51.110 --> 03:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
03:32:51.120 --> 03:32:51.990 align:start position:0%
marketplace
and

03:32:51.990 --> 03:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:32:52.000 --> 03:32:53.030 align:start position:0%
and
a

03:32:53.030 --> 03:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:32:56.229 --> 03:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
hps are one way to do that health
 
03:32:59.269 --> 03:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
insurance works by pooling risk but when
 
03:33:01.510 --> 03:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
your pool is too shallow it's hard to
 
03:33:03.750 --> 03:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
spread that risk affordably
 
03:33:05.910 --> 03:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
we have spread the risk through large
 
03:33:08.870 --> 03:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
health insurance companies or some large
 
03:33:10.550 --> 03:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
companies have enough employees to
 
03:33:10.560 --> 03:33:11.830 align:start position:0%
companies have enough employees to
self-insure

03:33:11.830 --> 03:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
self-insure
 
03:33:13.670 --> 03:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
in fact that's what the state of new
 
03:33:15.750 --> 03:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire does hiring an insurance
 
03:33:18.229 --> 03:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
company to administer the plan but
 
03:33:19.990 --> 03:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
taking on the risk of paying health
 
03:33:22.469 --> 03:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
insurance claims itself
 
03:33:25.110 --> 03:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
small and medium-sized companies and the
 
03:33:28.150 --> 03:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
self-employed don't have that option
 
03:33:31.110 --> 03:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
if we could give it to them
 
03:33:33.110 --> 03:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know it would be wonderful what if
 
03:33:35.110 --> 03:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
we allowed small companies to pull
 
03:33:37.670 --> 03:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
together to share that risk
 
03:33:40.070 --> 03:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
associated health plans could lower
 
03:33:43.190 --> 03:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
annual premiums up to 4 000 in small
 
03:33:46.150 --> 03:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
group markets and possibly as much as 10
 
03:33:48.550 --> 03:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
000 in the individual market
 
03:33:50.309 --> 03:33:50.319 align:start position:0%
let's find out if this kind of
 
03:33:53.110 --> 03:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
innovation can work in new hampshire
 
03:33:57.429 --> 03:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
sb 286 would set up a pilot program of
 
03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
up to 1 000 participants based on
 
03:34:00.239 --> 03:34:01.349 align:start position:0%
up to 1 000 participants based on
profession

03:34:01.349 --> 03:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
profession
 
03:34:04.630 --> 03:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
line of business or geographic region
 
03:34:07.510 --> 03:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
it would be open to any eligible person
 
03:34:10.309 --> 03:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
regardless of age or health history
 
03:34:12.710 --> 03:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
the department of insurance would report
 
03:34:15.510 --> 03:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
annually on the pilot's program's
 
03:34:18.150 --> 03:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
progress and the pilot would expire in
 
03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
2025 leaving it to future legislators
 
03:34:24.389 --> 03:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
whether this program should be extended
 
03:34:25.910 --> 03:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
or expanded
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
the committee amendment ensures that
 
03:34:29.750 --> 03:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
those taking part in the pilot will
 
03:34:32.070 --> 03:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
continue to receive the highest quality
 
03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
of care mandated in our statute
 
03:34:38.309 --> 03:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
sb 286 received unanimous support from
 
03:34:40.150 --> 03:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
the senate health and human services
 
03:34:42.309 --> 03:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
committee and pass the senate on the
 
03:34:43.910 --> 03:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
03:34:46.469 --> 03:34:46.479 align:start position:0%
i ask for your support for this bill
 
03:34:48.309 --> 03:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
which will add some innovation to new
 
03:34:54.389 --> 03:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:56.550 --> 03:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
okay representative van halen thank you
 
03:34:58.630 --> 03:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming um i would just
 
03:35:00.630 --> 03:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
like to to ask you for a definition at
 
03:35:03.510 --> 03:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
least as used here of association health
 
03:35:05.510 --> 03:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
plans that's a term i'm not familiar
 
03:35:08.229 --> 03:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
with okay so association health keep
 
03:35:09.429 --> 03:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
sure you're close to the mic because
 
03:35:12.150 --> 03:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
we're we actually okay sorry
 
03:35:14.150 --> 03:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
i always think i'm so loud
 
03:35:14.160 --> 03:35:15.190 align:start position:0%
i always think i'm so loud
um

03:35:15.190 --> 03:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:16.950 --> 03:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
for example
 
03:35:19.830 --> 03:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
let's just say all the real estate
 
03:35:22.630 --> 03:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
agencies wanted to pull together and
 
03:35:24.790 --> 03:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
become their own insurance it would
 
03:35:27.269 --> 03:35:27.279 align:start position:0%
offset their costs for their
 
03:35:30.150 --> 03:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh employees because they were able to
 
03:35:31.670 --> 03:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
pull together
 
03:35:34.550 --> 03:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
you could do it for
 
03:35:37.269 --> 03:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
any business could pull together that's
 
03:35:39.190 --> 03:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
like minded
 
03:35:39.200 --> 03:35:40.070 align:start position:0%
like minded
and

03:35:40.070 --> 03:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:43.190 --> 03:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
i think it would be a really great way
 
03:35:46.389 --> 03:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
it's a test it's a pilot so we see if it
 
03:35:48.389 --> 03:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
works if it works it could save a lot of
 
03:35:51.670 --> 03:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
money and really help people out
 
03:35:53.910 --> 03:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:35:57.030 --> 03:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
03:35:59.830 --> 03:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
03:36:01.750 --> 03:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for coming today with
 
03:36:03.030 --> 03:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:36:05.190 --> 03:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
what would the cost be
 
03:36:06.389 --> 03:36:06.399 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
03:36:06.399 --> 03:36:07.190 align:start position:0%
for the state
on

03:36:07.190 --> 03:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
to get this up or is it just basically
 
03:36:11.429 --> 03:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
letting them kind of
 
03:36:14.309 --> 03:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
run it themselves they presented and
 
03:36:16.630 --> 03:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
they are in agreement to do this as a
 
03:36:19.750 --> 03:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
pilot and they are there's no additional
 
03:36:21.590 --> 03:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
cost they're just going to participate
 
03:36:21.600 --> 03:36:22.790 align:start position:0%
cost they're just going to participate
um

03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:25.670 --> 03:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
if it were to be successful and we would
 
03:36:27.670 --> 03:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
be able to make it permanent i'm sure
 
03:36:29.510 --> 03:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
there would maybe be some additional
 
03:36:33.590 --> 03:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:35.510 --> 03:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett thank you mr
 
03:36:37.990 --> 03:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
chair um where would the actuarial
 
03:36:39.429 --> 03:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
tables be coming
 
03:36:41.830 --> 03:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
from to um set this up and would all
 
03:36:41.840 --> 03:36:42.790 align:start position:0%
from to um set this up and would all
comers

03:36:42.790 --> 03:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
comers
 
03:36:45.670 --> 03:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
be have to be accepted so regardless of
 
03:36:45.680 --> 03:36:46.950 align:start position:0%
be have to be accepted so regardless of
um

03:36:46.950 --> 03:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:48.630 --> 03:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
physical condition thank you for the
 
03:36:50.229 --> 03:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
question um
 
03:36:51.990 --> 03:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
everything is going to be under the
 
03:36:53.910 --> 03:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
department of insurance
 
03:36:57.110 --> 03:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh they've agreed to do this pilot and
 
03:36:59.510 --> 03:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
it will not exclude anyone we have those
 
03:37:01.670 --> 03:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
mandates set up in new hampshire and we
 
03:37:03.429 --> 03:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
are not going to
 
03:37:06.070 --> 03:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
change that so regardless of health or
 
03:37:06.080 --> 03:37:07.670 align:start position:0%
change that so regardless of health or
age

03:37:07.670 --> 03:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
age
 
03:37:12.229 --> 03:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:13.910 --> 03:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs
 
03:37:15.190 --> 03:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question quick
 
03:37:16.950 --> 03:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
question i know it's limited to a
 
03:37:19.110 --> 03:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
thousand participants is there a minimum
 
03:37:23.429 --> 03:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
number of people in each association
 
03:37:24.870 --> 03:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
for the health pla in the let's say
 
03:37:27.269 --> 03:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
there's a group i mean a realtors uh a
 
03:37:29.190 --> 03:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
subgroup or realtor yes just for the
 
03:37:31.830 --> 03:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
pilot they'll be they're going to put
 
03:37:33.910 --> 03:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
out um to
 
03:37:35.269 --> 03:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
see who would be interested in
 
03:37:37.190 --> 03:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
participating in the pilot should you
 
03:37:38.550 --> 03:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
pass this bill
 
03:37:38.560 --> 03:37:39.670 align:start position:0%
pass this bill
and

03:37:39.670 --> 03:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:37:42.950 --> 03:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
i believe there will be three different
 
03:37:45.030 --> 03:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
groups so
 
03:37:46.950 --> 03:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
it'll be limited
 
03:37:50.150 --> 03:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
as a pilot but i plan and hope to get
 
03:37:51.910 --> 03:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
behind it and make sure it's a success
 
03:37:53.830 --> 03:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
so that we can open this opportunity for
 
03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
everyone in new hampshire thank you
 
03:37:57.120 --> 03:37:58.710 align:start position:0%
everyone in new hampshire thank you
um

03:37:58.710 --> 03:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:58.720 --> 03:38:00.070 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:38:00.070 --> 03:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:38:01.590 --> 03:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
i i realize you're
 
03:38:04.950 --> 03:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
a freshman senator so you're maybe not
 
03:38:07.429 --> 03:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
been around or known a lot of health
 
03:38:08.790 --> 03:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
insurance stuff
 
03:38:10.389 --> 03:38:10.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm unfortunately been around too
 
03:38:10.399 --> 03:38:11.590 align:start position:0%
and i'm unfortunately been around too
long

03:38:11.590 --> 03:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
long
 
03:38:14.389 --> 03:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
and so the first question is is this
 
03:38:16.229 --> 03:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
having this thousand dollar limit is
 
03:38:16.239 --> 03:38:17.510 align:start position:0%
having this thousand dollar limit is
actually

03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:38:19.990 --> 03:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
unbelievable because it's usually their
 
03:38:21.590 --> 03:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
statute i think it's still i don't know
 
03:38:23.110 --> 03:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
did we repeal
 
03:38:25.349 --> 03:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
our statues we you had to have a minimum
 
03:38:28.229 --> 03:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
of three thousand people to be
 
03:38:30.469 --> 03:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh so so where did where did the
 
03:38:32.469 --> 03:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
thousand and come from where did you get
 
03:38:34.630 --> 03:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
this i may be a freshman but i do my
 
03:38:36.950 --> 03:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
homework okay and where did you get this
 
03:38:38.870 --> 03:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
from i i
 
03:38:40.790 --> 03:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
worked with the department of insurance
 
03:38:43.590 --> 03:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
to craft this for this pilot
 
03:38:46.150 --> 03:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
and um everybody was on board with this
 
03:38:48.150 --> 03:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
this is a pilot this is not you know
 
03:38:50.309 --> 03:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
etched in stone the department is
 
03:38:50.319 --> 03:38:51.510 align:start position:0%
etched in stone the department is
neutral

03:38:51.510 --> 03:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
03:38:53.510 --> 03:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
well they're neutral but i went i didn't
 
03:38:55.510 --> 03:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
just arbitrarily put this in without
 
03:38:58.070 --> 03:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
having discussions because if i had it
 
03:38:59.590 --> 03:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
my way it wouldn't be a pilot it would
 
03:39:00.790 --> 03:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
be permanent
 
03:39:04.630 --> 03:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:08.070 --> 03:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
so if if the plans have to comply with
 
03:39:12.070 --> 03:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
all our current state regulations
 
03:39:14.150 --> 03:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
all our mandates
 
03:39:17.110 --> 03:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
all our requirements
 
03:39:20.070 --> 03:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
why would the premium be less
 
03:39:21.750 --> 03:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
you're pooling
 
03:39:24.070 --> 03:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
you're pulling people together in a
 
03:39:26.710 --> 03:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
larger group and you're letting them do
 
03:39:26.720 --> 03:39:27.670 align:start position:0%
larger group and you're letting them do
this

03:39:27.670 --> 03:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:39:31.189 --> 03:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
independently of what we currently do
 
03:39:32.630 --> 03:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the part i don't get the
 
03:39:34.550 --> 03:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
independent part because if all the
 
03:39:36.550 --> 03:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
mandates in here are the exact same
 
03:39:36.560 --> 03:39:37.750 align:start position:0%
mandates in here are the exact same
mandates

03:39:37.750 --> 03:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
03:39:40.150 --> 03:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
that all small employers have to come
 
03:39:41.590 --> 03:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
you know have to you know when they get
 
03:39:41.600 --> 03:39:42.630 align:start position:0%
you know have to you know when they get
insurance

03:39:42.630 --> 03:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:39:45.750 --> 03:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
isn't when we have right now harvard and
 
03:39:45.760 --> 03:39:46.790 align:start position:0%
isn't when we have right now harvard and
anthem

03:39:46.790 --> 03:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
anthem
 
03:39:50.710 --> 03:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
isn't they just a very large
 
03:39:52.710 --> 03:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
associated health plan because they just
 
03:39:55.030 --> 03:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
have all these you know more than one
 
03:39:56.550 --> 03:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
thousand they have a bunch of thousands
 
03:39:58.550 --> 03:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
of people but that they're you're
 
03:40:00.229 --> 03:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
complying with the same they're
 
03:40:01.429 --> 03:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
complying with the exact same
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
regulations that you want to comply with
 
03:40:06.550 --> 03:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
well i think the difference is that
 
03:40:07.990 --> 03:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
when you have
 
03:40:09.670 --> 03:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
you're still going to have an insurance
 
03:40:12.150 --> 03:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
overseer be it blue cross or what have
 
03:40:15.030 --> 03:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
you mentioned you are now
 
03:40:16.469 --> 03:40:16.479 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go back to real estate
 
03:40:19.110 --> 03:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
agents how many are there in this state
 
03:40:21.429 --> 03:40:21.439 align:start position:0%
that could band together to reduce their
 
03:40:21.439 --> 03:40:22.469 align:start position:0%
that could band together to reduce their
costs

03:40:22.469 --> 03:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:40:25.110 --> 03:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
and then come under the umbrella of one
 
03:40:27.590 --> 03:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
of the larger companies
 
03:40:27.600 --> 03:40:28.389 align:start position:0%
of the larger companies
so

03:40:28.389 --> 03:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:40:31.269 --> 03:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
this is not an original idea and
 
03:40:33.030 --> 03:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
what the number one reason just because
 
03:40:34.550 --> 03:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
i always think it's important before
 
03:40:36.550 --> 03:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
someone leaves a committee why where we
 
03:40:36.560 --> 03:40:37.349 align:start position:0%
someone leaves a committee why where we
are

03:40:37.349 --> 03:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:40:39.750 --> 03:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
is that is a phrase called adverse
 
03:40:39.760 --> 03:40:41.189 align:start position:0%
is that is a phrase called adverse
selection

03:40:41.189 --> 03:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
selection
 
03:40:43.269 --> 03:40:43.279 align:start position:0%
and the adverse selection is that
 
03:40:44.630 --> 03:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
someone is going to try to create a
 
03:40:46.950 --> 03:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
group that theoretically everybody in
 
03:40:48.150 --> 03:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
that group is going to be young and
 
03:40:50.950 --> 03:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
healthy and so therefore that is the way
 
03:40:52.870 --> 03:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
they'll make the premiums lower
 
03:40:55.110 --> 03:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
but if you to take an association like
 
03:40:57.269 --> 03:40:57.279 align:start position:0%
you're describing let's say realtors
 
03:40:58.950 --> 03:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
we actually do we have two we have a
 
03:41:02.309 --> 03:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
banker's association and uh
 
03:41:04.630 --> 03:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
that they had an organization and we
 
03:41:07.269 --> 03:41:07.279 align:start position:0%
exempted them and we permit but we do
 
03:41:10.229 --> 03:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
have that 3000 person requirement
 
03:41:11.750 --> 03:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
because we want to make sure they stay
 
03:41:11.760 --> 03:41:13.429 align:start position:0%
because we want to make sure they stay
solvent

03:41:13.429 --> 03:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
solvent
 
03:41:13.439 --> 03:41:15.189 align:start position:0%
solvent
and

03:41:15.189 --> 03:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:16.550 --> 03:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day
 
03:41:16.560 --> 03:41:17.670 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day
you're

03:41:17.670 --> 03:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
you're
 
03:41:20.469 --> 03:41:20.479 align:start position:0%
you you haven't there's nothing in this
 
03:41:21.830 --> 03:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
that's going to be particularly
 
03:41:23.830 --> 03:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
attractive and they're still going to
 
03:41:26.070 --> 03:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
have to pay for all those associated
 
03:41:28.229 --> 03:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
costs for that entity whatever it is
 
03:41:29.349 --> 03:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's the
 
03:41:32.150 --> 03:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
retail merchants association or a new
 
03:41:35.189 --> 03:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospitality association
 
03:41:38.070 --> 03:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
that if they want to try to do this
 
03:41:39.510 --> 03:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
they have to still
 
03:41:40.870 --> 03:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
theoretically going to pay the same
 
03:41:43.510 --> 03:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
premium as everybody else
 
03:41:45.670 --> 03:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
well i had a lot of support for this and
 
03:41:47.990 --> 03:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
again it's a pilot and sometimes the
 
03:41:49.990 --> 03:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
pilot you have to get the kinks worked
 
03:41:53.670 --> 03:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
out and i do realize the history of
 
03:41:55.990 --> 03:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
trying to improve the health care costs
 
03:41:58.150 --> 03:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
for the granite staters and it has not
 
03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
been successful
 
03:42:01.910 --> 03:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
but we have to keep trying we have to
 
03:42:03.510 --> 03:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
keep doing something about it we can't
 
03:42:05.750 --> 03:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
leave it like it is so i'd ask for your
 
03:42:08.389 --> 03:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
consideration to try the pilot it is
 
03:42:10.469 --> 03:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
just that it's a test
 
03:42:13.189 --> 03:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
and how long does the pilot last for
 
03:42:15.349 --> 03:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
until 2025
 
03:42:18.550 --> 03:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
and then it theoretically could expire
 
03:42:21.590 --> 03:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
correct it depends on if it succeeds
 
03:42:23.030 --> 03:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
or it fails
 
03:42:24.710 --> 03:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
got it
 
03:42:27.110 --> 03:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative greeson
 
03:42:28.550 --> 03:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
for uh for introducing this uh
 
03:42:33.590 --> 03:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
at the end of the sunset
 
03:42:36.070 --> 03:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
how do those people maintain their
 
03:42:37.349 --> 03:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
health care coverage at that point
 
03:42:39.510 --> 03:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
assuming assuming for some reason that
 
03:42:41.349 --> 03:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
the pilot program failed because
 
03:42:41.359 --> 03:42:42.710 align:start position:0%
the pilot program failed because
sometimes

03:42:42.710 --> 03:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
03:42:46.309 --> 03:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:48.309 --> 03:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
we're in working with the department of
 
03:42:50.630 --> 03:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
insurance we're going to make allowances
 
03:42:52.309 --> 03:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
and we're going to get the those type of
 
03:42:54.229 --> 03:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
wrinkles taken out
 
03:42:56.070 --> 03:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
when the people who decide they want to
 
03:42:58.309 --> 03:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
participate come forward we'll be
 
03:43:01.429 --> 03:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
working with them on that
 
03:43:02.389 --> 03:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:43:05.030 --> 03:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you
 
03:43:08.070 --> 03:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh chair will call on tyler brennan the
 
03:43:10.309 --> 03:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
name of your insurance department
 
03:43:12.630 --> 03:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise the dry cleaner that gets the
 
03:43:18.070 --> 03:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:20.870 --> 03:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you i will do my best and uh
 
03:43:22.790 --> 03:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
um so tyler brandon life and health
 
03:43:24.389 --> 03:43:24.399 align:start position:0%
director of the insurance department and
 
03:43:25.910 --> 03:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt actually did point out a
 
03:43:27.189 --> 03:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
number of things i was going to my
 
03:43:29.670 --> 03:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
testimony um we are neutral on the on
 
03:43:32.150 --> 03:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
the bill and a lot of what i'd say about
 
03:43:34.309 --> 03:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
this bill as it relates to hps i would
 
03:43:36.389 --> 03:43:36.399 align:start position:0%
also say about some about the other bill
 
03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
student bill 160 that relates to me was
 
03:43:41.030 --> 03:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
they both are based on this concept that
 
03:43:42.550 --> 03:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
employers could come together and
 
03:43:44.469 --> 03:43:44.479 align:start position:0%
negotiate a better premium and we are
 
03:43:46.309 --> 03:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
talking about mostly small employers
 
03:43:47.990 --> 03:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
there was the example of sort of sole
 
03:43:50.469 --> 03:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
proprietors and that raises kind of some
 
03:43:53.189 --> 03:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
a number of other related issues
 
03:43:55.269 --> 03:43:55.279 align:start position:0%
but just to kind of touch base on what
 
03:43:57.110 --> 03:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
exists now for the small group market is
 
03:43:59.349 --> 03:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
you've got what is essentially a kind of
 
03:44:00.950 --> 03:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
a modified community rating type
 
03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
approach so insurers can adjust the
 
03:44:05.510 --> 03:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
premiums up to three to one based on the
 
03:44:07.750 --> 03:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
age of the people who are covered and
 
03:44:09.510 --> 03:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's a lot i mean three times the
 
03:44:11.349 --> 03:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
premium can change your premium from
 
03:44:13.110 --> 03:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
year to year quite a bit if you're a
 
03:44:15.110 --> 03:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
small employer and one of your younger
 
03:44:16.790 --> 03:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
employees leaves and you hire somebody
 
03:44:18.070 --> 03:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
who's older all of a sudden your average
 
03:44:20.229 --> 03:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
premium is quite a bit higher we've had
 
03:44:21.750 --> 03:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
to field a number of questions from
 
03:44:23.429 --> 03:44:23.439 align:start position:0%
employers who were surprised how much
 
03:44:25.349 --> 03:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
their premiums went up whereas the
 
03:44:27.110 --> 03:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
reality was their underlying sort of mix
 
03:44:29.189 --> 03:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
of employees did change
 
03:44:31.030 --> 03:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things that is exists both in
 
03:44:32.790 --> 03:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
state and federal laws though are these
 
03:44:34.229 --> 03:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
protections that you're all familiar
 
03:44:35.910 --> 03:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
with doing away with pre-existing
 
03:44:37.750 --> 03:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
conditions doing way with consideration
 
03:44:40.070 --> 03:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
of health status and that's going to be
 
03:44:41.510 --> 03:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
one of the limitations when you're
 
03:44:43.030 --> 03:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
trying to allow employers to come
 
03:44:45.510 --> 03:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
together and negotiate a better premium
 
03:44:47.189 --> 03:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
than what they're used to doing even if
 
03:44:48.710 --> 03:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
you could get around kind of those
 
03:44:48.720 --> 03:44:49.590 align:start position:0%
you could get around kind of those
federal

03:44:49.590 --> 03:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
federal
 
03:44:51.670 --> 03:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
regulations you do introduce that
 
03:44:53.910 --> 03:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
concept of risk selection
 
03:44:53.920 --> 03:44:54.790 align:start position:0%
concept of risk selection
and

03:44:54.790 --> 03:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:44:54.800 --> 03:44:56.150 align:start position:0%
and
so

03:44:56.150 --> 03:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:57.510 --> 03:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
one of the other realities is that our
 
03:44:59.510 --> 03:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
health insurance premiums the amounts we
 
03:45:02.710 --> 03:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
paid are carriers 80 between 85 and 92
 
03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
percent of those premiums go out in the
 
03:45:06.630 --> 03:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
form of medical claims costs
 
03:45:09.269 --> 03:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
that means if you're looking for a 20
 
03:45:11.110 --> 03:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
savings on the premiums
 
03:45:12.469 --> 03:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
there's got to be something very
 
03:45:14.070 --> 03:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
different about the insurance product
 
03:45:15.830 --> 03:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
you're buying in order to get there
 
03:45:17.990 --> 03:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
either you've got to reduce coverage or
 
03:45:19.590 --> 03:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
you've got to increase massively
 
03:45:21.510 --> 03:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
increased cost sharing or you've got to
 
03:45:23.910 --> 03:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
somehow cherry pick and that's one of
 
03:45:25.830 --> 03:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
the concerns obviously from the market
 
03:45:27.750 --> 03:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
point of view
 
03:45:29.429 --> 03:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
so the question about a pilot program
 
03:45:31.590 --> 03:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
like this is is well what is the
 
03:45:33.349 --> 03:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
insurance department going to do in
 
03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
developing a pilot program that's going
 
03:45:38.309 --> 03:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
to give those employers something that
 
03:45:40.550 --> 03:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
the carriers are not giving them now i
 
03:45:42.070 --> 03:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
like to remind people that it's their
 
03:45:43.510 --> 03:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
business it's the insurance companies
 
03:45:46.229 --> 03:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
business to develop products that people
 
03:45:48.309 --> 03:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
want to buy or employers want to buy at
 
03:45:50.710 --> 03:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
a competitive price point so somehow
 
03:45:52.309 --> 03:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
we've got to demand something from the
 
03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
carriers that they haven't been offering
 
03:45:56.550 --> 03:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
that would reduce premiums something
 
03:45:58.790 --> 03:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
significantly different
 
03:46:00.469 --> 03:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
generally when employers come together
 
03:46:01.590 --> 03:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
when people come together and
 
03:46:03.830 --> 03:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
collectively buy they're less likely to
 
03:46:05.590 --> 03:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
want to reduce benefits they're more
 
03:46:07.189 --> 03:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
likely to want to actually have more
 
03:46:09.429 --> 03:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
robust benefits even when you look at
 
03:46:10.870 --> 03:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
some of the products that are offered in
 
03:46:12.550 --> 03:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
the individual market versus those in
 
03:46:14.389 --> 03:46:14.399 align:start position:0%
the large group market you'll see narrow
 
03:46:16.389 --> 03:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
networks in the individual market in new
 
03:46:17.990 --> 03:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire you don't see neural networks
 
03:46:20.710 --> 03:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
in the group market generally speaking
 
03:46:21.830 --> 03:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
and that's because it's just harder to
 
03:46:23.429 --> 03:46:23.439 align:start position:0%
get a consensus about what hospitals
 
03:46:24.630 --> 03:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
you're going to leave out what benefits
 
03:46:25.990 --> 03:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to reduce and even the
 
03:46:27.830 --> 03:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
discussion about state mandates which
 
03:46:29.590 --> 03:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
ones do you want to throw out try to get
 
03:46:31.269 --> 03:46:31.279 align:start position:0%
any large group of people to agree to
 
03:46:33.269 --> 03:46:33.279 align:start position:0%
that it's just hard to do
 
03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
so there are certain practical
 
03:46:36.309 --> 03:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
challenges i think both regulatory and
 
03:46:38.070 --> 03:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
practical challenges to to get to a
 
03:46:39.670 --> 03:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
point where i think the employers are
 
03:46:41.030 --> 03:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
going to see the savings they might be
 
03:46:43.269 --> 03:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
looking for under this bill and i think
 
03:46:48.790 --> 03:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:50.469 --> 03:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
that being said i think i'm happy to
 
03:46:52.550 --> 03:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
take questions and uh
 
03:46:55.110 --> 03:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
about the bill representative bartlett
 
03:46:56.550 --> 03:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
03:46:56.560 --> 03:46:57.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

03:46:57.510 --> 03:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:59.349 --> 03:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
mr brennan would it be fair to say that
 
03:47:01.750 --> 03:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
a two-year pilot program um is a very
 
03:47:04.389 --> 03:47:04.399 align:start position:0%
short period of time
 
03:47:07.189 --> 03:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
it would be um we'd have to work pretty
 
03:47:08.469 --> 03:47:08.479 align:start position:0%
efficiently we'd have to develop a
 
03:47:10.870 --> 03:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
product that people wanted to enroll in
 
03:47:13.590 --> 03:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
really quickly and demonstrate
 
03:47:16.389 --> 03:47:16.399 align:start position:0%
real savings i think for them to do it
 
03:47:17.830 --> 03:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
that follow up for the question main
 
03:47:19.349 --> 03:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
query thank you would it also be fair to
 
03:47:21.750 --> 03:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
say that um when within any insurance
 
03:47:24.710 --> 03:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
product um your claims don't come all
 
03:47:26.229 --> 03:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
don't all come in
 
03:47:27.830 --> 03:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
in the first six months
 
03:47:29.349 --> 03:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
um you could have serious ones where
 
03:47:31.110 --> 03:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
only a thousand people
 
03:47:33.269 --> 03:47:33.279 align:start position:0%
in a group um you're talking very small
 
03:47:34.469 --> 03:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have too many cancer
 
03:47:37.030 --> 03:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
patients to blow the premium would that
 
03:47:39.349 --> 03:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
be fair yeah i think that's that's a
 
03:47:40.870 --> 03:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
good point so to the extent you would
 
03:47:42.630 --> 03:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
develop kind of in this and we make
 
03:47:44.070 --> 03:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
reference to this association health
 
03:47:45.670 --> 03:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
plan model which could take a lot of
 
03:47:47.269 --> 03:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
different variations we'd have to make
 
03:47:49.269 --> 03:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
some decisions about that preferably
 
03:47:51.429 --> 03:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
with some legislative intent but to the
 
03:47:53.269 --> 03:47:53.279 align:start position:0%
extent it's structured and then the
 
03:47:55.110 --> 03:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
carriers price it we're negotiating
 
03:47:57.990 --> 03:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps that price but you can't really
 
03:47:59.030 --> 03:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
then there's got to be the claims
 
03:48:00.389 --> 03:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
experience for them to actually come up
 
03:48:02.070 --> 03:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
with a new premium and generally
 
03:48:03.750 --> 03:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
speaking when you look at the markets
 
03:48:06.070 --> 03:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
over time if there's more uncertainty on
 
03:48:07.670 --> 03:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
the behalf of a carrier they're more
 
03:48:09.429 --> 03:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
likely to put in padding and make it
 
03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
more expensive they just don't want to
 
03:48:12.790 --> 03:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
lose they tend to be very risk adverse
 
03:48:14.229 --> 03:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
so i think you're right that sort of
 
03:48:15.830 --> 03:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
getting to a point where there's clearly
 
03:48:17.590 --> 03:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
demonstratable savings a product that
 
03:48:19.750 --> 03:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
people want to buy and it's better than
 
03:48:21.429 --> 03:48:21.439 align:start position:0%
what they're getting now or at least
 
03:48:23.110 --> 03:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
what's offered by the carriers that
 
03:48:24.630 --> 03:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
could take some time
 
03:48:26.229 --> 03:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
for the question main car just one more
 
03:48:29.349 --> 03:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
question um and even if a reinsurance
 
03:48:31.269 --> 03:48:31.279 align:start position:0%
policy were in place
 
03:48:33.830 --> 03:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
to make this acceptable um would it be
 
03:48:36.309 --> 03:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
likely that this premium would be low
 
03:48:37.750 --> 03:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
and would they be running into the same
 
03:48:39.510 --> 03:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of problems that the underlying
 
03:48:40.389 --> 03:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
would have
 
03:48:41.830 --> 03:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
so while the bill doesn't say
 
03:48:43.590 --> 03:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
specifically i think we're talking about
 
03:48:46.150 --> 03:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
fully insured business so to the extent
 
03:48:48.389 --> 03:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
where we're you know it's it's um you've
 
03:48:50.070 --> 03:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
got all those sort of rating concerns
 
03:48:51.590 --> 03:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
but again we're stuck in that small
 
03:48:53.510 --> 03:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
group rating model that three to one
 
03:48:56.070 --> 03:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
ratio the mandates are there so how much
 
03:48:57.910 --> 03:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility have we got i mean probably
 
03:48:59.590 --> 03:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
the easiest place to start is develop a
 
03:49:00.870 --> 03:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
narrow network model for the small
 
03:49:03.189 --> 03:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
employer market um that might be the
 
03:49:05.189 --> 03:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
sort of straightforward way of kind of
 
03:49:07.189 --> 03:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
scaling back the costs associated with
 
03:49:08.550 --> 03:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
but it's probably not something those
 
03:49:10.229 --> 03:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
employers want to roll with that's going
 
03:49:12.630 --> 03:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
to be the challenge
 
03:49:12.640 --> 03:49:14.229 align:start position:0%
to be the challenge
representative

03:49:14.229 --> 03:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:49:15.750 --> 03:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you take my
 
03:49:15.760 --> 03:49:16.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you take my
question

03:49:16.790 --> 03:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:49:18.229 --> 03:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like it's going to take a
 
03:49:19.590 --> 03:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
lot of your time
 
03:49:22.229 --> 03:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
i read the methodology and it sounds
 
03:49:22.239 --> 03:49:23.510 align:start position:0%
i read the methodology and it sounds
like

03:49:23.510 --> 03:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:49:25.750 --> 03:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's not going to take up too much time
 
03:49:28.550 --> 03:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
are you can you explain
 
03:49:30.150 --> 03:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
what you'll be doing
 
03:49:33.429 --> 03:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
yeah so you implement this pilot program
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
the bill is pretty thin so i think
 
03:49:37.269 --> 03:49:37.279 align:start position:0%
simply to satisfy the requirements of
 
03:49:39.189 --> 03:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
the bill this is not a massively
 
03:49:42.070 --> 03:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
resource intensive investment but to get
 
03:49:43.510 --> 03:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
to a point where you've got a product
 
03:49:44.870 --> 03:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's going to be less expensive a
 
03:49:46.710 --> 03:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
success in other words you're right it
 
03:49:48.630 --> 03:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
could be quite it could be quite
 
03:49:48.640 --> 03:49:51.510 align:start position:0%
could be quite it could be quite
involved

03:49:51.510 --> 03:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:51.520 --> 03:49:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:49:53.030 --> 03:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:49:55.349 --> 03:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
yes represent van gaal
 
03:49:57.910 --> 03:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr brennan um given that this
 
03:50:00.070 --> 03:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
is a short-term pilot
 
03:50:02.469 --> 03:50:02.479 align:start position:0%
and that people who enroll
 
03:50:04.630 --> 03:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
may end up nowhere in the end is there
 
03:50:06.870 --> 03:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
any kind of a safety net to a pilot that
 
03:50:09.510 --> 03:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
may be floundering
 
03:50:10.790 --> 03:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm not assuming that it would
 
03:50:13.590 --> 03:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
flounder but a pilot by virtue of
 
03:50:16.469 --> 03:50:16.479 align:start position:0%
definition may or may not succeed
 
03:50:19.110 --> 03:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
i think that's that's fair um it's
 
03:50:21.189 --> 03:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
probably more relevant to the miwa bill
 
03:50:23.110 --> 03:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
because there they're actually you're
 
03:50:25.349 --> 03:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
you're you've got sort of federal laws
 
03:50:27.590 --> 03:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
that prevent you from from from i think
 
03:50:29.590 --> 03:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
creating these separate risk pools and
 
03:50:32.229 --> 03:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
that's true for this bill as well but um
 
03:50:33.830 --> 03:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
if you anticipate a change at the
 
03:50:35.429 --> 03:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
federal level and then the ability to
 
03:50:37.590 --> 03:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
sort of manipulate those risk pools then
 
03:50:40.550 --> 03:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
it um it does get pretty complicated and
 
03:50:42.309 --> 03:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
you've got employers that perhaps left
 
03:50:44.229 --> 03:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
that small group market went into this
 
03:50:46.950 --> 03:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
alternative arrangement and every year
 
03:50:47.910 --> 03:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
they're always going to look at my
 
03:50:49.269 --> 03:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
better off in the standard market am i
 
03:50:50.950 --> 03:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
better off in this other arrangement and
 
03:50:51.990 --> 03:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to go where it's less
 
03:50:54.229 --> 03:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
expensive and they get more benefits so
 
03:50:55.750 --> 03:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
if you you know if you don't want them
 
03:50:58.070 --> 03:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
just going back and forth all the time
 
03:50:59.670 --> 03:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
then you might put in certain guardrails
 
03:51:00.870 --> 03:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
about how quickly they can go back and
 
03:51:02.469 --> 03:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
forth how much stability you might have
 
03:51:04.389 --> 03:51:04.399 align:start position:0%
to the risk pool but that itself would
 
03:51:06.389 --> 03:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
be a compromise for the employers who
 
03:51:08.070 --> 03:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
might want to make those choices every
 
03:51:08.080 --> 03:51:09.670 align:start position:0%
might want to make those choices every
year

03:51:09.670 --> 03:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:51:09.680 --> 03:51:10.870 align:start position:0%
year
sure

03:51:10.870 --> 03:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:51:13.429 --> 03:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
so um of course when i was reading it
 
03:51:15.750 --> 03:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
that it was a me was but it's not
 
03:51:15.760 --> 03:51:18.469 align:start position:0%
that it was a me was but it's not
because

03:51:18.469 --> 03:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:19.990 --> 03:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
i think from a practical story
 
03:51:22.550 --> 03:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
standpoint i look at them similarly i
 
03:51:24.309 --> 03:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
mean hp could take on a number of
 
03:51:26.790 --> 03:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
different variations i mean one option
 
03:51:28.229 --> 03:51:28.239 align:start position:0%
is you're simply coming together as a
 
03:51:30.309 --> 03:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
bunch of employer groups you're buying
 
03:51:31.750 --> 03:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
everything from the health insurance
 
03:51:34.150 --> 03:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
carrier another alternative is no you're
 
03:51:35.510 --> 03:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
actually taking on some of those
 
03:51:36.870 --> 03:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities from the insurance
 
03:51:38.150 --> 03:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
carrier you're doing your own
 
03:51:40.229 --> 03:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
negotiation with health care providers
 
03:51:41.750 --> 03:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
you're developing prescription drug
 
03:51:43.429 --> 03:51:43.439 align:start position:0%
formulas you're doing a lot of things
 
03:51:45.510 --> 03:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
the carriers might otherwise that might
 
03:51:47.830 --> 03:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
look more like one model or the other i
 
03:51:49.510 --> 03:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
mean to me and me was much more sort of
 
03:51:51.429 --> 03:51:51.439 align:start position:0%
that multi it's it's not just insurance
 
03:51:52.389 --> 03:51:52.399 align:start position:0%
it's you know you've got multiple
 
03:51:54.309 --> 03:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
employer welfare arrangements that may
 
03:51:57.189 --> 03:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
have benefits outside of insurance
 
03:51:59.750 --> 03:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
right and but this this was more modeled
 
03:51:59.760 --> 03:52:00.630 align:start position:0%
right and but this this was more modeled
after

03:52:00.630 --> 03:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
after
 
03:52:02.870 --> 03:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
the exemption when we did 7-eleven like
 
03:52:05.429 --> 03:52:05.439 align:start position:0%
the bankers association yeah
 
03:52:06.870 --> 03:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
i think that's it but it was a group
 
03:52:08.550 --> 03:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
because it was industry which i know
 
03:52:11.349 --> 03:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
that retailers and hospitality is
 
03:52:13.429 --> 03:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
had had been thinking about
 
03:52:13.439 --> 03:52:14.710 align:start position:0%
had had been thinking about
um

03:52:14.710 --> 03:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:14.720 --> 03:52:16.229 align:start position:0%
um
because

03:52:16.229 --> 03:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:52:18.150 --> 03:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
so what is the current meal law now do
 
03:52:19.670 --> 03:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
we still have one on the books so in
 
03:52:21.750 --> 03:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
terms of somebody wanting to start a new
 
03:52:24.389 --> 03:52:24.399 align:start position:0%
one or do we i know we had
 
03:52:25.670 --> 03:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
bills to
 
03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
bring the 3000 down to 400. i think
 
03:52:29.990 --> 03:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
you're thinking of that the purchasing
 
03:52:31.750 --> 03:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
alliance and there was there's there in
 
03:52:33.030 --> 03:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
the milwaukee bill there's a requirement
 
03:52:34.469 --> 03:52:34.479 align:start position:0%
for them to qualify as a purchasing
 
03:52:36.150 --> 03:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
alliance and it was three thousand i
 
03:52:38.309 --> 03:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
think it's 500 now and i think that was
 
03:52:41.910 --> 03:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
moving it even to 250 and and this is
 
03:52:43.429 --> 03:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
basically lowering the threshold for
 
03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
creating potentially creating a separate
 
03:52:47.110 --> 03:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
risk pool again if it were permissible
 
03:52:49.830 --> 03:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
under federal law which it's not um so
 
03:52:51.349 --> 03:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
what's the federal loan
 
03:52:53.349 --> 03:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
the federal law simply requires the
 
03:52:55.030 --> 03:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
single risk pool in that small group
 
03:52:56.790 --> 03:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
market not splitting them out and
 
03:52:58.710 --> 03:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
allowing you to create a separate risk
 
03:53:00.150 --> 03:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
pool for healthy people that can buy
 
03:53:04.070 --> 03:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:06.550 --> 03:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh okay help me again but
 
03:53:07.910 --> 03:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's what you're why you're coming
 
03:53:09.110 --> 03:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
together because you think you're
 
03:53:10.950 --> 03:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
attracting healthy people
 
03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
that's i think that's a the fundamental
 
03:53:14.870 --> 03:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
question is is why what do you expect to
 
03:53:17.189 --> 03:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
benefit from coming together and if it's
 
03:53:18.630 --> 03:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
going to be a separate risk pool that's
 
03:53:19.750 --> 03:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
going to be healthier people and that's
 
03:53:20.830 --> 03:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
why your premiums are going to be
 
03:53:22.790 --> 03:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
cheaper that's prohibited now well
 
03:53:24.630 --> 03:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
obviously yeah right okay if you think
 
03:53:26.150 --> 03:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of coming together because
 
03:53:27.910 --> 03:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
you could coordinate efforts you could
 
03:53:29.510 --> 03:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
come up with a new benefit design that
 
03:53:31.030 --> 03:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies don't offer
 
03:53:33.830 --> 03:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
today and you would demand that then
 
03:53:36.389 --> 03:53:36.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's some opportunity there
 
03:53:37.830 --> 03:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay now i got a question that i don't
 
03:53:39.750 --> 03:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
think anybody's ever asked you
 
03:53:42.469 --> 03:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
if i wanted to start one of these plans
 
03:53:43.990 --> 03:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
if i want to start
 
03:53:46.389 --> 03:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
how much capital do i have to have to
 
03:53:49.189 --> 03:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
begin to get this thing off the ground
 
03:53:50.710 --> 03:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of people who come into the
 
03:53:53.110 --> 03:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
state and you know let's say tufts came
 
03:53:54.229 --> 03:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
in and
 
03:53:58.150 --> 03:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
left and back and merged
 
03:54:00.150 --> 03:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
what does it cost to get one of these
 
03:54:01.349 --> 03:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
things up and running in the state of
 
03:54:03.349 --> 03:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire it would depend how it's
 
03:54:05.910 --> 03:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
structured and how much sort of risk
 
03:54:08.790 --> 03:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
that organization is taking on um that
 
03:54:10.389 --> 03:54:10.399 align:start position:0%
is though one of the concerns is that if
 
03:54:12.070 --> 03:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
you end up with an entity that actually
 
03:54:13.670 --> 03:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
acts as a middleman is collecting
 
03:54:15.590 --> 03:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
premiums from those employers right you
 
03:54:17.590 --> 03:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
have to be concerned around solvency and
 
03:54:19.590 --> 03:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's the reason that's one of the only
 
03:54:21.670 --> 03:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
examples of why in new hampshire we do
 
03:54:23.750 --> 03:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
have the ability to regulate self-funded
 
03:54:25.910 --> 03:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
medias okay
 
03:54:25.920 --> 03:54:26.710 align:start position:0%
medias okay
but

03:54:26.710 --> 03:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:54:28.790 --> 03:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day you have only two
 
03:54:30.630 --> 03:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
years and then
 
03:54:32.630 --> 03:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
the claims history of that two years
 
03:54:34.309 --> 03:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
could go out
 
03:54:36.150 --> 03:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
multiple years
 
03:54:37.750 --> 03:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
the tail
 
03:54:40.309 --> 03:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
i think that i think the the expectation
 
03:54:42.630 --> 03:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
that this would result in a lower cost
 
03:54:45.030 --> 03:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
um health insurance benefit design is is
 
03:54:46.870 --> 03:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
going to be tough to me very difficult
 
03:54:47.910 --> 03:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
to meet
 
03:54:47.920 --> 03:54:49.429 align:start position:0%
to meet
bingo

03:54:49.429 --> 03:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
bingo
 
03:54:52.389 --> 03:54:52.399 align:start position:0%

health plan um but they
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
have been are still interested in
 
03:55:48.070 --> 03:55:48.080 align:start position:0%

the group is not looking to that was not
 
03:56:09.269 --> 03:56:09.279 align:start position:0%

03:59:46.469 --> 03:59:46.479 align:start position:0%
director with the new hampshire
 
03:59:48.710 --> 03:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
insurance department i am introducing
 
03:59:50.950 --> 03:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
senate bill 287 on behalf of senator
 
03:59:53.110 --> 03:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
bradley this is a bill that was a
 
03:59:55.349 --> 03:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
request by the insurance department it
 
03:59:57.189 --> 03:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
deals with the no surprises act and it
 
03:59:59.670 --> 03:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
deals with balance billing new hampshire
 
04:00:01.590 --> 04:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
has a balanced billing protection law on
 
04:00:03.910 --> 04:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
the books as we have for four years the
 
04:00:06.070 --> 04:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
no surprises act went to effect in
 
04:00:08.469 --> 04:00:08.479 align:start position:0%
january of this year so we have a
 
04:00:10.710 --> 04:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
federal law that applies to insurance

04:01:12.790 --> 04:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of

minihan senior vice president state
 
04:01:16.950 --> 04:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
government relations with the new
 
04:01:18.150 --> 04:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital association
 
04:01:20.229 --> 04:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
representing all our hospitals we do
 
04:01:22.630 --> 04:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
support senate bill 287 and as the
 
04:01:25.349 --> 04:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
chairman said as amended by the senate
 
04:01:27.030 --> 04:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
we understood from previous
 
04:01:28.550 --> 04:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
conversations with the department of
 
04:01:31.030 --> 04:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
insurance why this legislation
 
04:01:32.950 --> 04:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
was introduced and the current law
 
04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
regarding balance billing is not
 
04:01:36.469 --> 04:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
consistent with the federal no surprises
 
04:01:38.150 --> 04:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
act and the department attempted with
 
04:01:39.670 --> 04:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
04:01:42.070 --> 04:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
as introduced to codify in state law the
 
04:01:44.229 --> 04:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
provisions in the federal law the issue
 
04:01:45.990 --> 04:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
with the original bill for us for the
 
04:01:48.469 --> 04:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
hospital association was that there were
 
04:01:50.229 --> 04:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
some outstanding questions with the
 
04:01:52.389 --> 04:01:52.399 align:start position:0%
federal regulations that are currently
 
04:01:54.710 --> 04:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
being challenged in federal courts in
 
04:01:58.389 --> 04:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
addition senate bill 287 exclu includes
 
04:02:01.349 --> 04:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
exclusive regulatory authority for the
 
04:02:03.670 --> 04:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner of insurance we worked on
 
04:02:05.990 --> 04:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
the bill with other stakeholders in and
 
04:02:07.750 --> 04:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
the department
 
04:02:10.950 --> 04:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
during the senate phase to address some
 
04:02:12.870 --> 04:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
of those provisions that we had
 
04:02:14.630 --> 04:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
questions and concerns with and as a
 
04:02:17.269 --> 04:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
result the bill was amended to reflect
 
04:02:19.110 --> 04:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
those provisions of the original bill
 
04:02:22.229 --> 04:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
that all stakeholders could agree to
 
04:02:24.469 --> 04:02:24.479 align:start position:0%
what i think is important to mention
 
04:02:26.469 --> 04:02:26.479 align:start position:0%
during these this discussion is that the
 
04:02:28.630 --> 04:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
patient or the consumer is protected by
 
04:02:31.510 --> 04:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
the federal regulation as well as the
 
04:02:34.070 --> 04:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
bill before you there cannot be any
 
04:02:35.910 --> 04:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
balance billing by an out of network
 
04:02:38.309 --> 04:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
provider as outlined in this federal no
 
04:02:41.269 --> 04:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
surprises act further the provider and
 
04:02:43.429 --> 04:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
payer if there is a dispute can follow
 
04:02:46.229 --> 04:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
the federal dispute resolution process
 
04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
once other areas of the federal
 
04:02:49.990 --> 04:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
regulation are resolved
 
04:02:52.870 --> 04:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
future legislation can be contemplated
 
04:02:55.189 --> 04:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
to codify the federal requirements and
 
04:02:57.189 --> 04:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
that's our position anyway
 
04:02:58.870 --> 04:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
and we thank you for the opportunity to
 
04:02:58.880 --> 04:03:01.349 align:start position:0%
and we thank you for the opportunity to
testify

04:03:01.349 --> 04:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
testify
 
04:03:03.750 --> 04:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay do we have questions from the
 
04:03:05.910 --> 04:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative
 
04:03:07.269 --> 04:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:03:10.070 --> 04:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
i went in for a procedure about a month
 
04:03:13.030 --> 04:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
ago and um i was surprised to see um
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
there was a statement in there or a
 
04:03:16.870 --> 04:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
couple sheets about balanced billing
 
04:03:18.309 --> 04:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
because i had you know questions and it
 
04:03:20.150 --> 04:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
really answered a lot of my questions is
 
04:03:22.950 --> 04:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
that the federal balance billing act or
 
04:03:26.150 --> 04:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
um i believe it is because as um mr
 
04:03:28.389 --> 04:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
brannon said um it went into effect in
 
04:03:31.030 --> 04:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
january so they should be following it
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
so yeah i bet it was very clear good
 
04:03:35.349 --> 04:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
thank you good thank you we have been
 
04:03:37.590 --> 04:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
working with our hospitals to ensure
 
04:03:40.309 --> 04:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
that they are in compliance um and there
 
04:03:42.790 --> 04:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
are toolkits that i think they have
 
04:03:44.630 --> 04:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
tried to um
 
04:03:46.389 --> 04:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
implement to make it consistent because
 
04:03:48.070 --> 04:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
i think it's also important for folks
 
04:03:49.670 --> 04:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
going from place to place that you're
 
04:03:52.870 --> 04:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
seeing something similar yeah
 
04:03:55.750 --> 04:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay so um what i'd like
 
04:03:58.309 --> 04:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
rather than having you respond to
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
the insurance department's amendment i
 
04:04:02.150 --> 04:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
was going to let let you come up let's
 
04:04:04.309 --> 04:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
have them introduce their
 
04:04:05.750 --> 04:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
amendment and then you can come up and
 
04:04:08.150 --> 04:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
respond to it okay
 
04:04:18.710 --> 04:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:20.309 --> 04:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
tyler brennan with the insurance
 
04:04:22.870 --> 04:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
department and uh thank you again
 
04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
so before i spend too much time talking
 
04:04:26.150 --> 04:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
about the differences in the bills i
 
04:04:27.750 --> 04:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're all on the same
 
04:04:29.349 --> 04:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
page closer yeah
 
04:04:30.710 --> 04:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
i want to make we're all make sure we're
 
04:04:32.070 --> 04:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
on the same page when we're talking
 
04:04:35.030 --> 04:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
about balanced billing situations so
 
04:04:37.590 --> 04:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
when you go into a in-network hospital
 
04:04:39.830 --> 04:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
you may be seen by a provider you didn't
 
04:04:42.070 --> 04:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
expect to see or you may not even be
 
04:04:44.710 --> 04:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
seen by them simply treated pathologist
 
04:04:46.870 --> 04:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
is a good example anesthesiologist might
 
04:04:49.269 --> 04:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
be another example and those providers
 
04:04:51.110 --> 04:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
might be out of network
 
04:04:53.269 --> 04:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
typically when you see an in-network
 
04:04:55.750 --> 04:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
provider your deductible your cost
 
04:04:57.910 --> 04:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
sharing goes up to the amount that the
 
04:04:59.830 --> 04:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
insurance company has negotiated with
 
04:05:02.150 --> 04:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
that provider this is substantially
 
04:05:03.510 --> 04:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
different in most cases than the
 
04:05:06.309 --> 04:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
providers charge and substantially less
 
04:05:07.910 --> 04:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
that saves you money on your cost
 
04:05:09.830 --> 04:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
sharing if you're seen by an out of
 
04:05:12.070 --> 04:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
network provider there is no agreement
 
04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
between the insurance company and that
 
04:05:16.309 --> 04:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
provider and that provider's charge is
 
04:05:17.910 --> 04:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
now what you're going to be balance
 
04:05:20.150 --> 04:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
billed for beyond anything the insurer
 
04:05:22.710 --> 04:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
pays if your benefits are limited enough
 
04:05:24.229 --> 04:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
the insurer may not even be paying
 
04:05:25.750 --> 04:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
anything toward that out of network
 
04:05:27.990 --> 04:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
providers care these are the cases where
 
04:05:29.429 --> 04:05:29.439 align:start position:0%
you're talking about sort of a surprise
 
04:05:32.309 --> 04:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
bill or balance billing as it takes up
 
04:05:34.389 --> 04:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
as it plays out so when new hampshire
 
04:05:36.630 --> 04:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
passed the law four years ago we did it
 
04:05:38.469 --> 04:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
with just the four specialties that
 
04:05:40.070 --> 04:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
you're most likely to see when you're in
 
04:05:42.070 --> 04:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
an in-network hospital those four
 
04:05:44.389 --> 04:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
specialties are anesthesiology pathology
 
04:05:47.110 --> 04:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
radiology or emergency medicine the no
 
04:05:49.510 --> 04:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
surprises act is much broader includes
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
any other professional provider you
 
04:05:53.110 --> 04:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
might see while at an in-network
 
04:05:55.349 --> 04:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
hospital one of the other things it does
 
04:05:57.510 --> 04:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
is it says if you go to of network
 
04:05:59.910 --> 04:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
hospital for emergency services you're
 
04:06:02.070 --> 04:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
also protected from balance billing and
 
04:06:04.070 --> 04:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
i think that's the circumstance that is
 
04:06:05.830 --> 04:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
most relevant to the hospitals or at
 
04:06:07.269 --> 04:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
least as they're being represented in
 
04:06:08.469 --> 04:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:06:09.910 --> 04:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
most of the time your networks in new
 
04:06:12.150 --> 04:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire include all of our hospitals
 
04:06:13.670 --> 04:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of examples where the
 
04:06:15.750 --> 04:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals are out of network primarily
 
04:06:17.590 --> 04:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
in individual products and they're also
 
04:06:20.309 --> 04:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
primarily the hca hospitals which are
 
04:06:22.870 --> 04:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
the for-profit chain that owns frisbee
 
04:06:25.910 --> 04:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
now frisbee parkland and portsmouth and
 
04:06:28.630 --> 04:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
they objected to the draft that we had
 
04:06:30.710 --> 04:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
both in the original bill and what the
 
04:06:32.550 --> 04:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
insurance department proposed as an
 
04:06:33.990 --> 04:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
alternative amendment that we thought
 
04:06:36.070 --> 04:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
might satisfy some of the confusion
 
04:06:37.670 --> 04:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
around what the federal requirements
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:06:40.790 --> 04:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
what actually came out of the senate is
 
04:06:42.950 --> 04:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
removing the insurance department from
 
04:06:45.429 --> 04:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
resolving disputes about how much of
 
04:06:47.590 --> 04:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
out-of-network provider would be paid if
 
04:06:48.870 --> 04:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
they're not already in that new
 
04:06:50.790 --> 04:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire statute those four specialties
 
04:06:53.349 --> 04:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
in other words so if there is a dispute
 
04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
about how much one of those hospitals
 
04:06:57.110 --> 04:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
might be paid it would go through the
 
04:06:59.510 --> 04:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
federal dispute resolution process the
 
04:07:01.750 --> 04:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
actual amount is as it was indicated is
 
04:07:03.910 --> 04:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat being challenged part of the
 
04:07:05.910 --> 04:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
reason for that is because it had a very
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
straightforward methodology it referred
 
04:07:10.469 --> 04:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
to this qpa this qualifying payment
 
04:07:11.990 --> 04:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
amount but it was basically the
 
04:07:14.309 --> 04:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
in-network median amount the federal
 
04:07:16.070 --> 04:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
guidance evolved a little bit it said
 
04:07:18.389 --> 04:07:18.399 align:start position:0%
okay well that's a starting point but
 
04:07:19.830 --> 04:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
you could actually consider other
 
04:07:21.830 --> 04:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
arguments the new hampshire law makes
 
04:07:23.910 --> 04:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
reference to commercially reasonable the
 
04:07:25.590 --> 04:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
insurance department would hold a public
 
04:07:27.670 --> 04:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
hearing we'd hear the arguments we'd
 
04:07:29.269 --> 04:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
look at the data as you know we've got
 
04:07:30.870 --> 04:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
access to the claims data we can figure
 
04:07:32.389 --> 04:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
out what is typically paid for health
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
care services we'd resolve the the the
 
04:07:36.630 --> 04:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
dispute at a local level through a
 
04:07:38.710 --> 04:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
public process in the fairest way
 
04:07:41.189 --> 04:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
possible we also would expect those
 
04:07:43.189 --> 04:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
insurance companies that we regulate to
 
04:07:45.429 --> 04:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
pay those out of network providers the
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
way the bills come over from the senate
 
04:07:48.630 --> 04:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
is those insurance companies would
 
04:07:50.550 --> 04:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
essentially be required to pay another
 
04:07:52.469 --> 04:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
network provider because of this this
 
04:07:54.309 --> 04:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
federal dispute resolution process
 
04:07:56.229 --> 04:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
conclusion we as the insurance
 
04:07:57.429 --> 04:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
department would not be directly
 
04:07:59.349 --> 04:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
involved again unless it's those four
 
04:08:01.349 --> 04:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
specialties the new hampshire law has
 
04:08:04.309 --> 04:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
been successful not only have we been
 
04:08:06.710 --> 04:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
able to avoid resolving disputes we've
 
04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
ended up with no more providers jumping
 
04:08:10.710 --> 04:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
out of the network one thing you want to
 
04:08:12.550 --> 04:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
you want to avoid doing is disrupting
 
04:08:14.710 --> 04:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
the apple cart creating an alternative
 
04:08:16.469 --> 04:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
that's better for either party and
 
04:08:18.149 --> 04:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
suddenly ending up with providers out of
 
04:08:20.149 --> 04:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
network that's one of the sort of
 
04:08:22.550 --> 04:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
successes that we've we have avoided we
 
04:08:24.469 --> 04:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
think similarly we can do that going
 
04:08:24.479 --> 04:08:25.510 align:start position:0%
think similarly we can do that going
forward

04:08:25.510 --> 04:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
part of the reason we asked for this
 
04:08:28.550 --> 04:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
bill is because at least historically
 
04:08:29.910 --> 04:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of legislative
 
04:08:32.389 --> 04:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
interest in maintaining local local
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
control at the state level and insurance
 
04:08:36.870 --> 04:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
is regulated at the state level
 
04:08:38.950 --> 04:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that we're looking for
 
04:08:40.469 --> 04:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
kind of a continued role in protecting
 
04:08:41.990 --> 04:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire consumers making sure
 
04:08:43.910 --> 04:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
insurance companies pay for these health
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
care services and either way keeping the
 
04:08:48.070 --> 04:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
patient out which i think is a notable
 
04:08:49.750 --> 04:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
point i mean either way federal state
 
04:08:51.510 --> 04:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
the patient shouldn't get pulled into it
 
04:08:52.630 --> 04:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
of course if they do we're going to
 
04:08:54.229 --> 04:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
refer them to the federal government
 
04:08:55.510 --> 04:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
never a place you want to be as a
 
04:08:58.149 --> 04:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
state-based insurance regulator
 
04:08:58.159 --> 04:08:58.950 align:start position:0%
state-based insurance regulator
so

04:08:58.950 --> 04:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
it's um that's the reason we're in favor
 
04:09:02.229 --> 04:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
but again it's based on history and of
 
04:09:04.469 --> 04:09:04.479 align:start position:0%
support for new hampshire
 
04:09:04.479 --> 04:09:05.910 align:start position:0%
support for new hampshire
based

04:09:05.910 --> 04:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
based
 
04:09:05.920 --> 04:09:07.110 align:start position:0%
based
solutions

04:09:07.110 --> 04:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
solutions
 
04:09:08.229 --> 04:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:09:09.429 --> 04:09:09.439 align:start position:0%
we're happy to give you the language
 
04:09:12.229 --> 04:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
that we had proposed that would modify
 
04:09:14.389 --> 04:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
this the original bill to make it more
 
04:09:17.349 --> 04:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
flexible so any sort of resolution that
 
04:09:18.630 --> 04:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
takes place at the federal level we
 
04:09:20.389 --> 04:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
could adapt to that at the end of the
 
04:09:21.990 --> 04:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
day we'd still be listening to the
 
04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
parties we'd be just making a
 
04:09:25.349 --> 04:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
determination about what that payment
 
04:09:27.670 --> 04:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
level should be based on arguments based
 
04:09:29.670 --> 04:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
on the data we have in new hampshire and
 
04:09:33.990 --> 04:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:36.309 --> 04:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions you have
 
04:09:39.030 --> 04:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
and how many complaints have we had with
 
04:09:41.830 --> 04:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
our new system zero we have had none of
 
04:09:43.670 --> 04:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
those four specialties petition the
 
04:09:45.750 --> 04:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
department i would also add that it
 
04:09:47.510 --> 04:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't you know our role in this
 
04:09:49.590 --> 04:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to come through a dispute
 
04:09:51.670 --> 04:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
we look at network advocacy we make sure
 
04:09:53.510 --> 04:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
the insurance carriers are actually
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
including the providers in their network
 
04:09:57.510 --> 04:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
if they have left out a key provider
 
04:09:59.429 --> 04:09:59.439 align:start position:0%
then we would ask or one providers that
 
04:10:01.189 --> 04:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
needs to be in the network to meet
 
04:10:03.110 --> 04:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
network adequacy we'd say have you made
 
04:10:05.110 --> 04:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
a commercially reasonable offer carriers
 
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
know that so it's not just manual to
 
04:10:08.070 --> 04:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
handle through the dispute legitimate
 
04:10:09.429 --> 04:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
process we do put pressure on the
 
04:10:11.429 --> 04:10:11.439 align:start position:0%
carriers but no we have not had to
 
04:10:13.510 --> 04:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
resolve any disputes through our public
 
04:10:15.349 --> 04:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
hearing process
 
04:10:17.110 --> 04:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative bertolt
 
04:10:18.389 --> 04:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:10:18.399 --> 04:10:19.590 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
okay

04:10:19.590 --> 04:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:10:21.590 --> 04:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
tyler you know i have to write very fast
 
04:10:23.429 --> 04:10:23.439 align:start position:0%
to keep up with you i'm sorry i could
 
04:10:25.590 --> 04:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
slow down a little bit
 
04:10:25.600 --> 04:10:26.630 align:start position:0%
slow down a little bit
um

04:10:26.630 --> 04:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:28.710 --> 04:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
i i would you help me with the lay of
 
04:10:30.950 --> 04:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
the land the bill came in
 
04:10:32.469 --> 04:10:32.479 align:start position:0%
where the insurance department was still
 
04:10:34.149 --> 04:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
the referee if you will
 
04:10:36.469 --> 04:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
then it was amended to
 
04:10:38.469 --> 04:10:38.479 align:start position:0%
comply with the federal law is that
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
correct and now you want to go back to
 
04:10:42.550 --> 04:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
the original
 
04:10:42.560 --> 04:10:43.349 align:start position:0%
the original
um

04:10:43.349 --> 04:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:46.550 --> 04:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
bill as it had been filed is that so
 
04:10:48.630 --> 04:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
there is the original bill it says very
 
04:10:50.229 --> 04:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
black and white we go with that federal
 
04:10:50.239 --> 04:10:51.269 align:start position:0%
black and white we go with that federal
process

04:10:51.269 --> 04:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:10:53.269 --> 04:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
there were two amendments discussed one
 
04:10:55.349 --> 04:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
is we remove the insurance department
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
from the disputes
 
04:10:58.309 --> 04:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
presumably it defaults to whatever
 
04:11:00.710 --> 04:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
federal process they decide and that's
 
04:11:01.990 --> 04:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's what came out of the senate the
 
04:11:03.750 --> 04:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
alternative was let's soften the
 
04:11:05.590 --> 04:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
language in the original bill let's give
 
04:11:07.269 --> 04:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
a little more flexibility let's still
 
04:11:08.870 --> 04:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
make reference to that federal dispute
 
04:11:10.950 --> 04:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
resolution process but let's keep the
 
04:11:12.550 --> 04:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
insurance department involved in the
 
04:11:14.630 --> 04:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
middle of these disputes so that for
 
04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
their services that are not currently in
 
04:11:18.710 --> 04:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law we continue to play a
 
04:11:20.389 --> 04:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
role and we make sure our insurance
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
companies pay those out of network
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
providers okay mask development for the
 
04:11:28.070 --> 04:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
question being carter okay so then
 
04:11:30.630 --> 04:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
if you if you go back to amend it soften
 
04:11:32.469 --> 04:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
the language a little bit
 
04:11:34.550 --> 04:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
um so the insurance department continues
 
04:11:36.309 --> 04:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
to be the referee but still has to
 
04:11:37.670 --> 04:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
comply with
 
04:11:39.189 --> 04:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
04:11:41.110 --> 04:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
guideline or the federal law
 
04:11:42.630 --> 04:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
um as it is
 
04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
but it's in dispute right now how does
 
04:11:44.880 --> 04:11:45.750 align:start position:0%
but it's in dispute right now how does
that

04:11:45.750 --> 04:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:11:45.760 --> 04:11:47.030 align:start position:0%
that
affect

04:11:47.030 --> 04:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
affect
 
04:11:48.630 --> 04:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
what you would have to do
 
04:11:51.030 --> 04:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
in the future to amend this bill or
 
04:11:53.269 --> 04:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
do we wait right so
 
04:11:55.189 --> 04:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
what's being disputed obviously by the
 
04:11:56.870 --> 04:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
providers is how much they're going to
 
04:12:00.070 --> 04:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
get paid so we as third of the referee
 
04:12:02.070 --> 04:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
in this would take a look at that
 
04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
whatever the federal process ends up
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
being and say is that a fair process
 
04:12:08.389 --> 04:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
should we hear additional arguments
 
04:12:10.469 --> 04:12:10.479 align:start position:0%
what we have to do as a state is we have
 
04:12:12.630 --> 04:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
to be at least as consumer protective as
 
04:12:13.990 --> 04:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
the federal law
 
04:12:16.309 --> 04:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
so we couldn't just say yeah pay the
 
04:12:17.750 --> 04:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
provider more i mean the cost sharing
 
04:12:19.910 --> 04:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
will go up and we're all happy except
 
04:12:21.830 --> 04:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies that would be
 
04:12:23.349 --> 04:12:23.359 align:start position:0%
that would not be as protective as that
 
04:12:24.870 --> 04:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
federal law so as long as we are as
 
04:12:26.870 --> 04:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
protective as the federal law and all
 
04:12:28.309 --> 04:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
intents and purposes we're going to be
 
04:12:30.149 --> 04:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
looking at what that federal decision
 
04:12:32.149 --> 04:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
would be we might consider local
 
04:12:34.229 --> 04:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
information that we have both the claims
 
04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
data the arguments that we hear going
 
04:12:39.030 --> 04:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
forward and act as a neutral party um
 
04:12:41.030 --> 04:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
but you know it's it's i think to the
 
04:12:42.389 --> 04:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
extent there's concern about where the
 
04:12:43.990 --> 04:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
federal government is going to land the
 
04:12:46.469 --> 04:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
language that we've proposed would allow
 
04:12:48.550 --> 04:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
us to be flexible wherever they land and
 
04:12:50.630 --> 04:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
still resolve it at the local level
 
04:12:52.469 --> 04:12:52.479 align:start position:0%
and then one more question
 
04:12:53.670 --> 04:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry
 
04:12:53.680 --> 04:12:54.550 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry
um

04:12:54.550 --> 04:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:55.990 --> 04:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
in trying to refresh my memory i do
 
04:12:57.910 --> 04:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
remember when we passed this bill four
 
04:13:01.750 --> 04:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
years ago regarding the four specialties
 
04:13:02.950 --> 04:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
those who
 
04:13:04.630 --> 04:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
i know the reference to the insurance
 
04:13:07.189 --> 04:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
department but i don't remember who in
 
04:13:09.030 --> 04:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
the insurance department would be the
 
04:13:11.189 --> 04:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
referee if there were a case that had to
 
04:13:13.110 --> 04:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
go further yeah as you know in most
 
04:13:14.469 --> 04:13:14.479 align:start position:0%
insurance laws it refers to the
 
04:13:15.910 --> 04:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner and that's how
 
04:13:17.830 --> 04:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's structured there that being said
 
04:13:19.349 --> 04:13:19.359 align:start position:0%
the insurance commissioner does almost
 
04:13:21.030 --> 04:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
nothing on his own i mean we've got to
 
04:13:22.309 --> 04:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
leave a lot of resources in the
 
04:13:24.070 --> 04:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
department we would support that process
 
04:13:25.910 --> 04:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
and the decision and obviously listen to
 
04:13:27.269 --> 04:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
the arguments that each of the parties
 
04:13:29.590 --> 04:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
would make
 
04:13:31.189 --> 04:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
because that's a concern is there a
 
04:13:33.349 --> 04:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
hearings officer involved
 
04:13:33.359 --> 04:13:34.229 align:start position:0%
hearings officer involved
yes

04:13:34.229 --> 04:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:13:36.070 --> 04:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
there is okay
 
04:13:38.830 --> 04:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you does the deputy get
 
04:13:39.910 --> 04:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
involved and
 
04:13:41.990 --> 04:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
who else gets involved
 
04:13:44.229 --> 04:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
um the specific process of public of a
 
04:13:45.670 --> 04:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
hearing might be better answered by
 
04:13:45.680 --> 04:13:46.950 align:start position:0%
hearing might be better answered by
michelle

04:13:46.950 --> 04:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
michelle
 
04:13:49.189 --> 04:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
it's but there
 
04:13:50.229 --> 04:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
you would be able to draw on the
 
04:13:51.830 --> 04:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
resources of the department we actually
 
04:13:53.429 --> 04:13:53.439 align:start position:0%
modified the hearing rules because we
 
04:13:55.110 --> 04:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
knew in the balance billing legislation
 
04:13:56.950 --> 04:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
passed a few years ago one of the
 
04:13:58.389 --> 04:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
reasons the insurance department was put
 
04:14:00.229 --> 04:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
in the middle is because we have access
 
04:14:02.070 --> 04:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
to the claims data we can look at what
 
04:14:03.990 --> 04:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
was paid for the same type of service
 
04:14:06.469 --> 04:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
across the network over time
 
04:14:07.990 --> 04:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
but the actual sort of end of the day
 
04:14:10.149 --> 04:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
decision is still you know it follows
 
04:14:11.670 --> 04:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
those that that here at the hearing
 
04:14:13.189 --> 04:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
rules which would involve the hearing
 
04:14:15.110 --> 04:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
officer and the process
 
04:14:17.110 --> 04:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative fargo
 
04:14:18.790 --> 04:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
yes and thank you
 
04:14:20.790 --> 04:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
i think i understand it but the bill we
 
04:14:23.590 --> 04:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
have today is this
 
04:14:25.670 --> 04:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
with what amendment is this the original
 
04:14:27.910 --> 04:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
bill or is this the original bill in the
 
04:14:29.990 --> 04:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
first amendment or is
 
04:14:32.710 --> 04:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
yeah is the amendment that you are
 
04:14:34.950 --> 04:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
suggesting to give
 
04:14:38.070 --> 04:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
more flexibility and share
 
04:14:39.910 --> 04:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
not written yet so
 
04:14:41.429 --> 04:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
it's in the original bill that was
 
04:14:43.110 --> 04:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
introduced to this yeah what's a little
 
04:14:45.110 --> 04:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
confusing is the bill is relatively long
 
04:14:47.110 --> 04:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
most of it are relatively minor
 
04:14:49.030 --> 04:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
technical changes just to align new
 
04:14:51.110 --> 04:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire laws with the federal process
 
04:14:52.710 --> 04:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
but the key provision of it which is
 
04:14:54.550 --> 04:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
resolving the disputes
 
04:14:55.990 --> 04:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
for any of the services not already
 
04:14:57.670 --> 04:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
covering new hampshire law the insurance
 
04:14:59.750 --> 04:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
department is not involved we would like
 
04:15:01.750 --> 04:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
to see the insurance department involved
 
04:15:03.830 --> 04:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
so that's the amendment we would propose
 
04:15:05.030 --> 04:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
oh so you're
 
04:15:07.030 --> 04:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
so there will be an amendment
 
04:15:10.149 --> 04:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
to what we will it's not here yet gus an
 
04:15:12.550 --> 04:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
amendment in the subcommittee
 
04:15:14.710 --> 04:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
but the amendment uh you if you wanted
 
04:15:16.389 --> 04:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
to see what it's going to basically look
 
04:15:18.790 --> 04:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
like is look up the bill as introduced
 
04:15:20.229 --> 04:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:29.349 --> 04:15:29.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you tyler great all right
 
04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
so paula you want to tell us why
 
04:15:33.670 --> 04:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
you think
 
04:15:35.510 --> 04:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
this version is better than the
 
04:15:40.950 --> 04:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:43.189 --> 04:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
04:15:44.790 --> 04:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
i don't usually comment on amendments
 
04:15:46.469 --> 04:15:46.479 align:start position:0%
that i have not seen and it sounds like
 
04:15:49.590 --> 04:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
no one you have read the original bill
 
04:15:52.790 --> 04:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
the original bill has introduced what
 
04:15:54.790 --> 04:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
was wrong with that bill
 
04:15:58.870 --> 04:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
as my testimony indicated um we do have
 
04:16:01.110 --> 04:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
concerns about the
 
04:16:03.750 --> 04:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
authority um the sole authority of the
 
04:16:05.590 --> 04:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
department of insurance commissioner
 
04:16:07.269 --> 04:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
nothing against the commissioner that we
 
04:16:09.030 --> 04:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
have that has nothing to do with that
 
04:16:09.990 --> 04:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
04:16:12.149 --> 04:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
again as tyler said no one has gone
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
through this process we also asked for
 
04:16:17.429 --> 04:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
an appeal process
 
04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
remember the hospitals or the providers
 
04:16:21.189 --> 04:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
are not regulated by the department of
 
04:16:23.269 --> 04:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
insurance insurers are
 
04:16:25.110 --> 04:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
the hospitals are regulated by the
 
04:16:28.070 --> 04:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
department of hhs it is uncomfortable
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
when you if you would think about that
 
04:16:33.510 --> 04:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
for a hospital and by the way um i don't
 
04:16:35.189 --> 04:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
quite know what that comment was about
 
04:16:37.429 --> 04:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
hca hospitals all i represent all the
 
04:16:39.670 --> 04:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
hospitals and they all support
 
04:16:42.309 --> 04:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
the position that i testified on we
 
04:16:44.950 --> 04:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
support the amended bill so i just want
 
04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
to be on record
 
04:16:46.319 --> 04:16:47.269 align:start position:0%
to be on record
um

04:16:47.269 --> 04:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:47.279 --> 04:16:48.710 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:16:48.710 --> 04:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:16:48.720 --> 04:16:50.229 align:start position:0%
so
the

04:16:50.229 --> 04:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:16:52.469 --> 04:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
we have concerns about that process it
 
04:16:55.510 --> 04:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
has not been used we we asked for more
 
04:16:57.030 --> 04:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
of an appeal
 
04:17:00.469 --> 04:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
process to consider that the qualified
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
payment amount which is qpa which is
 
04:17:05.910 --> 04:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
what tyler was referencing that's what's
 
04:17:05.920 --> 04:17:07.269 align:start position:0%
what tyler was referencing that's what's
being

04:17:07.269 --> 04:17:07.279 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:17:09.110 --> 04:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
challenged if you will at the federal
 
04:17:12.229 --> 04:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
level has not been resolved yet so
 
04:17:15.750 --> 04:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
that is of concern to us as well um and
 
04:17:17.830 --> 04:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully you know we won't need to use
 
04:17:20.710 --> 04:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
this um and but we do have the federal
 
04:17:20.720 --> 04:17:22.790 align:start position:0%
this um and but we do have the federal
process

04:17:22.790 --> 04:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:17:24.950 --> 04:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
in in regulation and that is what the
 
04:17:26.950 --> 04:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals need to follow so i just want
 
04:17:28.950 --> 04:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
to reassure people that that the
 
04:17:31.590 --> 04:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
independent dispute resolution process
 
04:17:32.710 --> 04:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
if there were
 
04:17:35.269 --> 04:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
an issue if there could if there is an
 
04:17:35.279 --> 04:17:36.070 align:start position:0%
an issue if there could if there is an
issue

04:17:36.070 --> 04:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:17:39.910 --> 04:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
that process kicks in and that is a
 
04:17:42.790 --> 04:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
process that the parties the carrier and
 
04:17:44.070 --> 04:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
the provider
 
04:17:46.469 --> 04:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
mutually select the certified
 
04:17:50.309 --> 04:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
independent dispute resolution
 
04:17:52.389 --> 04:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
individual um or
 
04:17:55.030 --> 04:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
company whatever it is um the
 
04:17:58.229 --> 04:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
the the qualified individual to do that
 
04:18:00.870 --> 04:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution um that is that is
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
just dif very different that and i i'm
 
04:18:05.030 --> 04:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
sure you can appreciate that it's just
 
04:18:07.990 --> 04:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
very the provider's perspective is just
 
04:18:10.550 --> 04:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
that those two things are not resolved
 
04:18:13.349 --> 04:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
so let's put into statute
 
04:18:17.349 --> 04:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
in state statute what is not disputed um
 
04:18:19.750 --> 04:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
and and everyone's comfortable with and
 
04:18:22.630 --> 04:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
let's wait for the federal process to
 
04:18:24.710 --> 04:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
and the federal challenges to end and
 
04:18:27.510 --> 04:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
then we have another
 
04:18:29.510 --> 04:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
another session and when those things
 
04:18:31.349 --> 04:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
get resolved and i'm sure another bill
 
04:18:33.110 --> 04:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
could come forward but we are not
 
04:18:35.110 --> 04:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the process
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
as i have not looked at the amendment
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
but if it's the original bill
 
04:18:40.710 --> 04:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
that's why we
 
04:18:43.510 --> 04:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
testified ins with concerns about the
 
04:18:45.670 --> 04:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
original bill that's why we had numerous
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
conversations um with the stakeholders
 
04:18:51.030 --> 04:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
and the department which we appreciate
 
04:18:53.510 --> 04:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
but we never got to
 
04:18:55.429 --> 04:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
a place where everyone could say let's
 
04:18:58.870 --> 04:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
support this this change so that's why
 
04:18:58.880 --> 04:19:00.149 align:start position:0%
support this this change so that's why
the

04:19:00.149 --> 04:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:19:02.870 --> 04:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
modified or amended bill was passed
 
04:19:02.880 --> 04:19:03.830 align:start position:0%
modified or amended bill was passed
that's

04:19:03.830 --> 04:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:19:06.389 --> 04:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
given that there is no federal insurance
 
04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner what would the process be
 
04:19:11.590 --> 04:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
on the federal side
 
04:19:13.349 --> 04:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
since we we went to we walked through
 
04:19:14.550 --> 04:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
all the things that would happen here on
 
04:19:16.389 --> 04:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
the state side right in terms of the
 
04:19:16.399 --> 04:19:17.510 align:start position:0%
the state side right in terms of the
hearings

04:19:17.510 --> 04:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
04:19:18.550 --> 04:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
it would
 
04:19:18.560 --> 04:19:19.349 align:start position:0%
it would
the

04:19:19.349 --> 04:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:19:21.830 --> 04:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
federal independent dispute resolution
 
04:19:23.830 --> 04:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
process would kick in like i said they
 
04:19:23.840 --> 04:19:25.590 align:start position:0%
process would kick in like i said they
would

04:19:25.590 --> 04:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:19:27.429 --> 04:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
i mean i i can get you more
 
04:19:29.429 --> 04:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
documentation but do we have any
 
04:19:30.870 --> 04:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
experience with that have does the
 
04:19:32.309 --> 04:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
hospital have no
 
04:19:35.750 --> 04:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
not to date this would be a new entity
 
04:19:38.309 --> 04:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
it just started and it just never had a
 
04:19:40.550 --> 04:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
federal dispute for anything else not to
 
04:19:42.309 --> 04:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
mine not in new hampshire so this is
 
04:19:44.950 --> 04:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
going to be brand spanking new um but
 
04:19:47.269 --> 04:19:47.279 align:start position:0%
i'm sure others other parts of the
 
04:19:49.830 --> 04:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
country they have but the independent
 
04:19:52.469 --> 04:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution process that is those
 
04:19:54.870 --> 04:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
entities have existed because other
 
04:19:54.880 --> 04:19:55.830 align:start position:0%
entities have existed because other
states

04:19:55.830 --> 04:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:19:58.950 --> 04:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
companies have used exactly so that's
 
04:20:01.670 --> 04:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
not new um those entities are not new we
 
04:20:03.670 --> 04:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
just have not had that experience okay
 
04:20:05.110 --> 04:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
04:20:07.030 --> 04:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so
 
04:20:09.670 --> 04:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
what if i know that thing's in the way
 
04:20:09.680 --> 04:20:10.830 align:start position:0%
what if i know that thing's in the way
so

04:20:10.830 --> 04:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:20:10.840 --> 04:20:12.710 align:start position:0%
so
what

04:20:12.710 --> 04:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:20:16.229 --> 04:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
in that the um independent dispute
 
04:20:18.229 --> 04:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
resolution is parts of it or in court
 
04:20:21.349 --> 04:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
right now or or whatever wherever it is
 
04:20:23.349 --> 04:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
what if we didn't pass anything on this
 
04:20:24.830 --> 04:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:20:24.840 --> 04:20:26.389 align:start position:0%
right now
um

04:20:26.389 --> 04:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:28.870 --> 04:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
because it is so new
 
04:20:28.880 --> 04:20:29.830 align:start position:0%
because it is so new
and

04:20:29.830 --> 04:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:31.590 --> 04:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
there are problems
 
04:20:33.990 --> 04:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
with how it would be handled would it
 
04:20:35.110 --> 04:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
make sense
 
04:20:37.750 --> 04:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
to wait until whatever these issues are
 
04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
settled and then
 
04:20:41.189 --> 04:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
come back
 
04:20:41.199 --> 04:20:41.990 align:start position:0%
come back
and

04:20:41.990 --> 04:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:44.870 --> 04:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
propose a new bill if necessary
 
04:20:48.229 --> 04:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
um that would be our preference um the
 
04:20:50.469 --> 04:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
independent dispute resolution
 
04:20:53.110 --> 04:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
process represented bartlett is not i
 
04:20:54.950 --> 04:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
don't think that is being challenged in
 
04:20:56.710 --> 04:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
court it's the qpa it's how you
 
04:20:59.189 --> 04:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
calculate the qualified payment amount
 
04:21:01.429 --> 04:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
that's a new term we don't use that in
 
04:21:03.349 --> 04:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire um i wrote that down okay
 
04:21:05.349 --> 04:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
but qpa and i can get you more
 
04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
information about the there are some
 
04:21:08.790 --> 04:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
fact sheets on no surprises act which i
 
04:21:10.469 --> 04:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
i can bring tomorrow
 
04:21:12.389 --> 04:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
which i think might be helpful um and
 
04:21:14.790 --> 04:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
maybe tyler has the same but um i'm
 
04:21:17.030 --> 04:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
happy to pull that together thank you
 
04:21:17.040 --> 04:21:18.790 align:start position:0%
happy to pull that together thank you
yep

04:21:18.790 --> 04:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:21:20.870 --> 04:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative later um thank you
 
04:21:23.189 --> 04:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
very much i'm a little bit confused if
 
04:21:23.199 --> 04:21:24.550 align:start position:0%
very much i'm a little bit confused if
the

04:21:24.550 --> 04:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:21:25.830 --> 04:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
04:21:27.830 --> 04:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh law against uh
 
04:21:29.750 --> 04:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
gets passed and we and these things are
 
04:21:32.309 --> 04:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
resolved would we really need a state
 
04:21:32.319 --> 04:21:33.830 align:start position:0%
resolved would we really need a state
law

04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:21:36.389 --> 04:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
that is for i think
 
04:21:38.550 --> 04:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
for you the general court to decide the
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
department has a position that they want
 
04:21:44.229 --> 04:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
that to be codified in state law
 
04:21:46.070 --> 04:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
because we already have a balanced
 
04:21:48.710 --> 04:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
billing law it's in um it's not
 
04:21:50.630 --> 04:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
consistent and i obviously don't
 
04:21:52.070 --> 04:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
represent the department they should
 
04:21:54.630 --> 04:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
speak to that just so you know in other
 
04:21:57.750 --> 04:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
states um they they have not implemented
 
04:21:59.910 --> 04:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
a state law to your point if the federal
 
04:21:59.920 --> 04:22:00.710 align:start position:0%
a state law to your point if the federal
law

04:22:00.710 --> 04:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
kind of you know is is in existence
 
04:22:05.910 --> 04:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
and they don't have a state law
 
04:22:07.750 --> 04:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
that's fine it just defaults to the
 
04:22:10.550 --> 04:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
federal process so i think i know where
 
04:22:12.630 --> 04:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
you're going but i i
 
04:22:14.229 --> 04:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
04:22:16.229 --> 04:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
at least testimony from the department
 
04:22:18.309 --> 04:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
is that they want there to be
 
04:22:20.389 --> 04:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
consistency with because we already have
 
04:22:23.429 --> 04:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
a balanced billing law that tyler
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
already outlined it's it's limited but
 
04:22:29.030 --> 04:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
they want to make sure that it the
 
04:22:30.630 --> 04:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
federal and the state
 
04:22:33.269 --> 04:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
laws are codified we did not have again
 
04:22:35.030 --> 04:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have a problem with putting it
 
04:22:37.189 --> 04:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
into state law the issue is when there
 
04:22:39.590 --> 04:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
is when there's the it doesn't
 
04:22:41.590 --> 04:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
completely codify you know if you're
 
04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
making some changes
 
04:22:45.990 --> 04:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
just like further questioning well the
 
04:22:48.070 --> 04:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
only difference i would see is that
 
04:22:49.990 --> 04:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
these things would be maybe resolved on
 
04:22:51.670 --> 04:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
a local level
 
04:22:53.830 --> 04:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
and maybe that's more convenient as as
 
04:22:56.550 --> 04:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
the insurance department seemed to say
 
04:22:58.630 --> 04:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
is the only difference i could see am i
 
04:22:59.670 --> 04:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
wrong there
 
04:22:59.680 --> 04:23:00.389 align:start position:0%
wrong there
the

04:23:00.389 --> 04:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:00.399 --> 04:23:01.269 align:start position:0%
the
um

04:23:01.269 --> 04:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:04.710 --> 04:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
way that the qpa is potentially
 
04:23:04.720 --> 04:23:06.389 align:start position:0%
way that the qpa is potentially
considered

04:23:06.389 --> 04:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
considered
 
04:23:09.349 --> 04:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
that calculation i am this is not my
 
04:23:11.590 --> 04:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
area of expertise um but
 
04:23:13.670 --> 04:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
that may be different um and the
 
04:23:16.229 --> 04:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
independent dispute resolution
 
04:23:18.790 --> 04:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
component is different
 
04:23:21.110 --> 04:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
because we don't have that in this state
 
04:23:23.110 --> 04:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
i think some states may
 
04:23:25.590 --> 04:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
or they use arbitration
 
04:23:26.950 --> 04:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
but we
 
04:23:29.750 --> 04:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
we have chosen not to do that
 
04:23:32.870 --> 04:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
per se um so again we just we had
 
04:23:35.670 --> 04:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
discussions good fruitful discussions it

full-blown new amendment that everyone
 
04:23:43.349 --> 04:23:43.359 align:start position:0%

dispute resolution process okay here's
 
04:24:33.030 --> 04:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
how it is outlined
 
04:24:34.870 --> 04:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
on the federal level
 
04:24:34.880 --> 04:24:36.550 align:start position:0%
on the federal level
um

04:24:36.550 --> 04:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
it brings in a third party known as a
 
04:24:41.429 --> 04:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
certified independent dispute resolution
 
04:24:44.950 --> 04:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
entity to decide the payment amount
 
04:24:47.349 --> 04:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
the parties mutually select the
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
certified independent dispute resolution
 
04:24:53.030 --> 04:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
entity and everyone involved must attest
 
04:24:55.750 --> 04:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
to having no conflicts of interest
 
04:24:58.229 --> 04:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
and requires the provider or the
 
04:25:00.790 --> 04:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
facility and health plan to submit
 
04:25:03.030 --> 04:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
payment offers to the certified
 
04:25:05.590 --> 04:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
independent dispute resolution entity
 
04:25:07.750 --> 04:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
and additional information supporting
 
04:25:10.070 --> 04:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
their payment offers
 
04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
and then it requires the certified
 
04:25:14.870 --> 04:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
independent dispute resolution entity to
 
04:25:17.750 --> 04:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
select from the payment offers
 
04:25:20.149 --> 04:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
both the provider or facility and the
 
04:25:23.110 --> 04:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
health plan must abide by the certified
 
04:25:25.590 --> 04:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
entities decision and payment must be
 
04:25:28.790 --> 04:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
made within 30 calendar days
 
04:25:31.030 --> 04:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
parties to a dispute reserve priorities
 
04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
to a dispute use a new federal
 
04:25:35.269 --> 04:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
independent speech resolution portal
 
04:25:39.269 --> 04:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
which will open in 2022
 
04:25:41.750 --> 04:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
so that's how it is designed on the
 
04:25:44.070 --> 04:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
04:25:44.080 --> 04:25:45.429 align:start position:0%
federal level
and

04:25:45.429 --> 04:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:48.149 --> 04:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
why i think as paula mentioned we don't
 
04:25:50.950 --> 04:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
think that the dispute resolution
 
04:25:53.110 --> 04:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh needs to be part of this bill uh
 
04:25:55.590 --> 04:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
because it has already been addressed on
 
04:25:56.950 --> 04:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
the federal level
 
04:25:58.950 --> 04:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
um and that's all i wanted to just
 
04:26:01.110 --> 04:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
answer your question directly appreciate
 
04:26:03.429 --> 04:26:03.439 align:start position:0%

04:26:08.880 --> 04:26:10.389 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:26:10.389 --> 04:26:10.399 align:start position:0%

04:26:14.149 --> 04:26:14.159 align:start position:0%

04:28:36.870 --> 04:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:39.189 --> 04:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
very simply uh
 
04:28:40.790 --> 04:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
i've i have a
 
04:28:42.550 --> 04:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
distributor a beer distributor in my
 
04:28:45.910 --> 04:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
district who had come close to the cap
 
04:28:48.309 --> 04:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
on what was being allowed to be
 
04:28:50.950 --> 04:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
direct shipped which was 27
 
04:28:53.750 --> 04:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
gallons and so i went
 
04:28:55.189 --> 04:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
to the liquor commission we had a
 
04:28:57.990 --> 04:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
discussion uh as to what we might be
 
04:29:00.950 --> 04:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
able to increase that volume to so that
 
04:29:03.349 --> 04:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
we don't have a business that that we're
 
04:29:06.149 --> 04:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
stifling at at a certain point uh we
 
04:29:08.710 --> 04:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
came to a mutual agreement that uh 50
 
04:29:08.720 --> 04:29:09.750 align:start position:0%
came to a mutual agreement that uh 50
gallons

04:29:09.750 --> 04:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
gallons
 
04:29:11.510 --> 04:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
of beer would be good this is for
 
04:29:13.349 --> 04:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
in-state and out-of-state direct
 
04:29:15.670 --> 04:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
shippers and so that's all the bill does
 
04:29:20.950 --> 04:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:23.349 --> 04:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
so how many cases of beer is that
 
04:29:23.359 --> 04:29:24.389 align:start position:0%
so how many cases of beer is that
well

04:29:24.389 --> 04:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:29:26.389 --> 04:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
do the math
 
04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh i think i figured out with 27 gallons
 
04:29:33.910 --> 04:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
it was like a can and a half a beer
 
04:29:39.110 --> 04:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:40.630 --> 04:29:40.640 align:start position:0%

okay
 
04:30:21.030 --> 04:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
so um anyway um as senator daniels just
 
04:30:23.990 --> 04:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
said this bill was initially introduced
 
04:30:24.000 --> 04:30:25.269 align:start position:0%
said this bill was initially introduced
and

04:30:25.269 --> 04:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:30:27.189 --> 04:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
was affecting
 
04:30:31.110 --> 04:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
beer wine and spirits across the board
 
04:30:34.229 --> 04:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
as introduced it did not have muster
 
04:30:36.710 --> 04:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
to pass out of senate commerce so it was
 
04:30:36.720 --> 04:30:38.229 align:start position:0%
to pass out of senate commerce so it was
amended

04:30:38.229 --> 04:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
amended
 
04:30:40.469 --> 04:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
twice the second amendment was a floor
 
04:30:40.479 --> 04:30:41.510 align:start position:0%
twice the second amendment was a floor
amendment

04:30:41.510 --> 04:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:30:43.110 --> 04:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
senator daniels brought
 
04:30:44.630 --> 04:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
and he had an opportunity to work with
 
04:30:47.429 --> 04:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission the day before but
 
04:30:48.630 --> 04:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
no other
 
04:30:50.389 --> 04:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
industry groups were part of that
 
04:30:52.790 --> 04:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
conversation and i think that our
 
04:30:55.590 --> 04:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
concern is that this is singling out
 
04:30:58.070 --> 04:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
one sector of the total beverage alcohol
 
04:31:00.309 --> 04:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
industry in new hampshire and
 
04:31:01.750 --> 04:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
we don't necessarily agree with that
 
04:31:03.830 --> 04:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
approach i think it's been
 
04:31:05.189 --> 04:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
pointed out by the liquor commission
 
04:31:05.199 --> 04:31:07.110 align:start position:0%
pointed out by the liquor commission
that

04:31:07.110 --> 04:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:31:07.120 --> 04:31:08.550 align:start position:0%
that
no

04:31:08.550 --> 04:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:31:10.070 --> 04:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
existing new hampshire business with a
 
04:31:13.110 --> 04:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
direct to consumer license right now is
 
04:31:15.349 --> 04:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
hit the ceiling of the limits we did a
 
04:31:17.990 --> 04:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
lot of uh changes last year with sb 125
 
04:31:19.990 --> 04:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
which your committee supported
 
04:31:20.000 --> 04:31:21.110 align:start position:0%
which your committee supported
changing

04:31:21.110 --> 04:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
changing
 
04:31:23.110 --> 04:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
permissions and
 
04:31:24.950 --> 04:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
privileges for direct to consumer
 
04:31:28.870 --> 04:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
shipments for producers of all sizes and
 
04:31:30.950 --> 04:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
there's also some potential issues with
 
04:31:33.590 --> 04:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
litigation regarding not treating all
 
04:31:36.309 --> 04:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
entities in the industry equally
 
04:31:37.830 --> 04:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues that deal with the
 
04:31:39.910 --> 04:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
grand home case which um you've probably
 
04:31:41.110 --> 04:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
heard about from the liquor commission
 
04:31:43.269 --> 04:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
before so um
 
04:31:45.429 --> 04:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
we're all about fair market competition
 
04:31:47.830 --> 04:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
and and regulation i would consider the
 
04:31:50.070 --> 04:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
liquor commission's comments um during
 
04:31:51.429 --> 04:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
04:31:54.070 --> 04:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
on the senate side and
 
04:31:56.070 --> 04:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
happy to send some written testimony
 
04:31:57.429 --> 04:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
over to everybody
 
04:31:59.030 --> 04:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
via email and i'll make sure the clerk
 
04:32:00.630 --> 04:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
has it as well
 
04:32:02.309 --> 04:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
that's really all i wanted to say at
 
04:32:03.830 --> 04:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
this time i just want to make sure that
 
04:32:03.840 --> 04:32:05.189 align:start position:0%
this time i just want to make sure that
everybody's

04:32:05.189 --> 04:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
everybody's
 
04:32:07.269 --> 04:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
looking at this thing equally
 
04:32:11.189 --> 04:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
so your opposition is because
 
04:32:13.910 --> 04:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's only beer not including the alcohol
 
04:32:16.070 --> 04:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
is that the reason your opposition i'm
 
04:32:17.429 --> 04:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
just make sure i understand we actually
 
04:32:20.070 --> 04:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
had no input when this floor amendment
 
04:32:21.670 --> 04:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
we had no opportunity to meet with the
 
04:32:23.510 --> 04:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
liquor commissioner senator david here's
 
04:32:25.349 --> 04:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
your chance give us your input tell us
 
04:32:27.030 --> 04:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
tell us what's wrong why this is a bad
 
04:32:29.269 --> 04:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
idea like i said it should treat all
 
04:32:31.429 --> 04:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
entities equally
 
04:32:32.950 --> 04:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
and i think there's concern about
 
04:32:35.910 --> 04:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
litigation when you don't
 
04:32:37.670 --> 04:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's it okay
 
04:32:39.590 --> 04:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:32:41.429 --> 04:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
and she hand up yes representative
 
04:32:41.439 --> 04:32:43.750 align:start position:0%
and she hand up yes representative
johnson

04:32:43.750 --> 04:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
johnson
 
04:32:45.349 --> 04:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
so if if
 
04:32:47.590 --> 04:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
because it just addresses just the beer
 
04:32:47.600 --> 04:32:49.349 align:start position:0%
because it just addresses just the beer
manufacturers

04:32:49.349 --> 04:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
04:32:50.710 --> 04:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
would you be
 
04:32:52.870 --> 04:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
open for an amendment that basically
 
04:32:55.510 --> 04:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
just opens it up for 50 gallons for
 
04:32:55.520 --> 04:32:56.309 align:start position:0%
just opens it up for 50 gallons for
all

04:32:56.309 --> 04:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:32:59.110 --> 04:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
beer wine and spirits well i certainly
 
04:33:01.590 --> 04:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
can't speak for other industry members
 
04:33:03.269 --> 04:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
that may or may not have been consulted
 
04:33:05.510 --> 04:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
on this but i would say that for us
 
04:33:07.830 --> 04:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's an equity a parity and a
 
04:33:09.269 --> 04:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
fairness issue so that would certainly
 
04:33:11.990 --> 04:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
be better than not being involved in the
 
04:33:15.590 --> 04:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
decision-making process uh at this point
 
04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh i can assure you that the liquor
 
04:33:19.990 --> 04:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
commission would be in opposition for us
 
04:33:22.230 --> 04:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
to change these numbers
 
04:33:22.240 --> 04:33:23.029 align:start position:0%
to change these numbers
so

04:33:23.029 --> 04:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:27.269 --> 04:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:29.269 --> 04:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you sir
 
04:33:31.510 --> 04:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
for for testifying i guess i'm confused
 
04:33:33.910 --> 04:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
as to who you actually represent because
 
04:33:35.670 --> 04:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
you are now presented with the body that
 
04:33:37.910 --> 04:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
can actually change legislation
 
04:33:40.390 --> 04:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
and yet you are hesitant or reluctant
 
04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason to provide us
 
04:33:45.189 --> 04:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
with what you would like to see
 
04:33:45.199 --> 04:33:46.150 align:start position:0%
with what you would like to see
uh

04:33:46.150 --> 04:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:48.470 --> 04:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know who who was not consulted and
 
04:33:50.150 --> 04:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
what would they
 
04:33:52.070 --> 04:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
what would they want in here
 
04:33:53.670 --> 04:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
what was left out
 
04:33:56.709 --> 04:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
i i'm i'm perplexed
 
04:33:59.029 --> 04:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:34:01.590 --> 04:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
i guess what do you want yeah well
 
04:34:03.029 --> 04:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question it's a good one
 
04:34:04.789 --> 04:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
um we really think that the limits are
 
04:34:06.310 --> 04:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
fine where they are there's no need to
 
04:34:09.590 --> 04:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
modify them nobody's hit the ceiling um
 
04:34:11.590 --> 04:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
and i think this was brought on behalf
 
04:34:14.470 --> 04:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
of one brewery um in the state which is
 
04:34:16.869 --> 04:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
in senator daniel's district um and
 
04:34:18.230 --> 04:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
they're not even a member of the brewers
 
04:34:20.551 --> 04:34:20.561 align:start position:0%
association in the state um there was
 
04:34:21.830 --> 04:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
not any support from the brewers
 
04:34:23.910 --> 04:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
association for this either and i do not
 
04:34:26.390 --> 04:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
know if there was support or not from
 
04:34:28.150 --> 04:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
the winemakers association or the
 
04:34:30.310 --> 04:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
distilled spirits craft association in
 
04:34:32.150 --> 04:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
the state so i think those groups should
 
04:34:33.990 --> 04:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
be involved in the process and there was
 
04:34:35.830 --> 04:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
a reason this had an interim study vote
 
04:34:37.109 --> 04:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
initially and i think it probably needs
 
04:34:40.551 --> 04:34:40.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:42.070 --> 04:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
representative pilot
 
04:34:44.070 --> 04:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chair um will the liquor
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
commission be here tomorrow
 
04:34:46.799 --> 04:34:49.109 align:start position:0%
commission be here tomorrow
uh

04:34:49.109 --> 04:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:34:49.119 --> 04:34:51.590 align:start position:0%
uh
probably

04:34:51.590 --> 04:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
probably
 
04:34:51.600 --> 04:34:53.269 align:start position:0%
probably
okay

04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:34:56.789 --> 04:34:56.799 align:start position:0%
so that yes so
 
04:34:58.390 --> 04:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
yes i know i know why the liquor
 
04:34:59.830 --> 04:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
commission has a problem
 
04:35:04.230 --> 04:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:06.230 --> 04:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
how much money do you really make on a
 
04:35:08.709 --> 04:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
case of beer
 
04:35:12.310 --> 04:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
how much does a beer distributor make
 
04:35:14.230 --> 04:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
it depends on what what question you're
 
04:35:15.269 --> 04:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
asking you talking about wholesale
 
04:35:16.869 --> 04:35:16.879 align:start position:0%
margin you talking about well i'm saying
 
04:35:19.510 --> 04:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm saying you know that that the issue
 
04:35:20.949 --> 04:35:20.959 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
04:35:23.029 --> 04:35:23.039 align:start position:0%
distilled and wines and everything
 
04:35:24.310 --> 04:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
through you know the the electric
 
04:35:24.320 --> 04:35:25.349 align:start position:0%
through you know the the electric
commission

04:35:25.349 --> 04:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:35:27.590 --> 04:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
has a uh
 
04:35:29.830 --> 04:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
five percent tax
 
04:35:32.789 --> 04:35:32.799 align:start position:0%
and on wine and eight percent distilled
 
04:35:34.709 --> 04:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
and that they've always that that number
 
04:35:36.709 --> 04:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
is pretty low we're not really making a
 
04:35:37.910 --> 04:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
lot of money
 
04:35:39.910 --> 04:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
in this case when it comes to beverages
 
04:35:41.590 --> 04:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
everybody still pay the 30 cents a
 
04:35:43.670 --> 04:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
gallon still gets paid correct so the
 
04:35:45.750 --> 04:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
state doesn't lose anything
 
04:35:48.551 --> 04:35:48.561 align:start position:0%
the only person who's losing out if a
 
04:35:50.709 --> 04:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
beer distributor manufacturer is
 
04:35:52.310 --> 04:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
distributing themselves
 
04:35:54.551 --> 04:35:54.561 align:start position:0%
is uh you guys get screwed because
 
04:35:57.990 --> 04:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
you're not getting to deliver that beer
 
04:35:59.990 --> 04:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
and i've just
 
04:36:00.869 --> 04:36:00.879 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:36:02.230 --> 04:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
i guess you can't you can't really tell
 
04:36:03.349 --> 04:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
me that's a
 
04:36:05.109 --> 04:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
corporate secret how much a case of beer
 
04:36:07.670 --> 04:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
is but i can't imagine that that
 
04:36:10.470 --> 04:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
at 12 cases of beer that there's that
 
04:36:12.150 --> 04:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
much money on the table that you would
 
04:36:14.869 --> 04:36:14.879 align:start position:0%
be upset about having some beverage
 
04:36:17.429 --> 04:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
manufacturer deciding that they decide
 
04:36:19.189 --> 04:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
that they don't want to go through
 
04:36:21.629 --> 04:36:21.639 align:start position:0%
distribution that they want to
 
04:36:21.639 --> 04:36:23.189 align:start position:0%
distribution that they want to
self-distribute

04:36:23.189 --> 04:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
self-distribute
 
04:36:26.869 --> 04:36:26.879 align:start position:0%
which which at the end of the day that's
 
04:36:28.709 --> 04:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
the original intent of the legislation
 
04:36:30.470 --> 04:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
was to allow manufacturers to
 
04:36:32.150 --> 04:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
self-distribute this is different from
 
04:36:34.230 --> 04:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
self-distribution right this is
 
04:36:36.070 --> 04:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
direct-to-consumer distribution
 
04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
self-distribution is to licensed
 
04:36:39.109 --> 04:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
accounts right and they have a 2500
 
04:36:41.109 --> 04:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
barrel limit on that which is much much
 
04:36:41.119 --> 04:36:42.310 align:start position:0%
barrel limit on that which is much much
higher

04:36:42.310 --> 04:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
higher
 
04:36:44.470 --> 04:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
i think the other point that was made
 
04:36:46.869 --> 04:36:46.879 align:start position:0%
regarding the five percent uh tax
 
04:36:49.109 --> 04:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
revenue on wine and the eight percent on
 
04:36:51.349 --> 04:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
spirits whether that's shipped direct to
 
04:36:52.789 --> 04:36:52.799 align:start position:0%
consumer or shipped through the liquor
 
04:36:54.629 --> 04:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
commission the state's gonna get paid
 
04:36:56.551 --> 04:36:56.561 align:start position:0%
anyway they still collect the tax eighty
 
04:36:58.629 --> 04:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
percent right on the direct consumer
 
04:37:00.629 --> 04:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
shipments so it's the same same argument
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
for beer right the taxes we're still
 
04:37:03.510 --> 04:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
going to get the eight percent right
 
04:37:04.150 --> 04:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
you're still getting at the eight
 
04:37:06.629 --> 04:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
percent so yeah
 
04:37:09.189 --> 04:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
or or the state in you know by the state
 
04:37:10.470 --> 04:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
peeling out
 
04:37:12.949 --> 04:37:12.959 align:start position:0%
wine and spirits out of this bill when
 
04:37:15.269 --> 04:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
they amended it
 
04:37:17.349 --> 04:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
that you know that doesn't necessarily
 
04:37:18.709 --> 04:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
protect them
 
04:37:20.869 --> 04:37:20.879 align:start position:0%
or you know create any more revenue for
 
04:37:21.830 --> 04:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
them because they can still get the
 
04:37:23.269 --> 04:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
revenue if it's sold by an out-of-state
 
04:37:25.590 --> 04:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
entity shipped into us to you know
 
04:37:28.551 --> 04:37:28.561 align:start position:0%
representative hunt in uh in rindge uh
 
04:37:30.551 --> 04:37:30.561 align:start position:0%
they're still gonna get paid so that
 
04:37:32.629 --> 04:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
argument doesn't necessarily hold water
 
04:37:32.639 --> 04:37:34.150 align:start position:0%
argument doesn't necessarily hold water
um

04:37:34.150 --> 04:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:36.310 --> 04:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
with regard they were happy because we
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
put in that if you ship
 
04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
more than a thousand bottles to somebody
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
then you had to make it offer available
 
04:37:44.310 --> 04:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
to the commission
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
which nobody's you know you're you're
 
04:37:48.070 --> 04:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
not worried about whether these these
 
04:37:50.709 --> 04:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturers make it available
 
04:37:52.230 --> 04:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
for you to sell
 
04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
well i think you know to answer that
 
04:37:55.269 --> 04:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
question we're certainly not worried
 
04:37:57.429 --> 04:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
about the liquor commission's business
 
04:37:59.670 --> 04:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
model when it comes to wine and spirits
 
04:38:01.029 --> 04:38:01.039 align:start position:0%
you know we're more concerned about
 
04:38:04.230 --> 04:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
three-tier system relative to beer and
 
04:38:05.830 --> 04:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
you know sort of the the regulatory
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
changes that were set up you know in the
 
04:38:09.830 --> 04:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
past and continue to be modified over
 
04:38:11.109 --> 04:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
the years it works pretty well and
 
04:38:12.869 --> 04:38:12.879 align:start position:0%
there's no real reason to change the
 
04:38:14.629 --> 04:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
limits you're going to change it change
 
04:38:16.709 --> 04:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
it for everybody got him all right
 
04:38:16.719 --> 04:38:21.990 align:start position:0%
it for everybody got him all right
representing

04:38:21.990 --> 04:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:23.590 --> 04:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for testimony
 
04:38:26.470 --> 04:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh you made a reference to the issue of
 
04:38:28.629 --> 04:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
fairness with the other industries with
 
04:38:31.269 --> 04:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
beer and spirits or wine and spirits and
 
04:38:33.750 --> 04:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
the current limit is 27 gallons is that
 
04:38:33.760 --> 04:38:34.709 align:start position:0%
the current limit is 27 gallons is that
correct

04:38:34.709 --> 04:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:38:37.029 --> 04:38:37.039 align:start position:0%
i believe so yes so could you explain
 
04:38:39.429 --> 04:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
how the current limit is fair
 
04:38:41.910 --> 04:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
that 27 gallon limit how is that fair
 
04:38:45.029 --> 04:38:45.039 align:start position:0%
currently with the other
 
04:38:45.039 --> 04:38:46.070 align:start position:0%
currently with the other
liquor

04:38:46.070 --> 04:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
liquor
 
04:38:49.269 --> 04:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
industries one and one in spirits
 
04:38:51.109 --> 04:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say that it's necessarily
 
04:38:52.230 --> 04:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
fair and i don't know what the
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
justification was when those numbers
 
04:38:55.830 --> 04:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
were come up with representative hunt
 
04:38:57.269 --> 04:38:57.279 align:start position:0%
would probably have a better idea
 
04:38:59.109 --> 04:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
because it was quite a while ago but i
 
04:39:00.390 --> 04:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
will tell you that those numbers have
 
04:39:03.429 --> 04:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
been fixed for decades and i think to
 
04:39:05.429 --> 04:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily change one of those
 
04:39:07.510 --> 04:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
categories up and not address the other
 
04:39:09.750 --> 04:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
ones i'd like to know what the rationale
 
04:39:11.590 --> 04:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
is for that i mean we don't we don't
 
04:39:13.830 --> 04:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
we're not hitting limit for beer
 
04:39:14.949 --> 04:39:14.959 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we're hitting the limit
 
04:39:17.029 --> 04:39:17.039 align:start position:0%
for wine or for spirits but the liquor
 
04:39:18.709 --> 04:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
commission might have that data and i
 
04:39:19.990 --> 04:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
think we should make those decisions
 
04:39:22.470 --> 04:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
based on you know on facts and need not
 
04:39:26.070 --> 04:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:27.750 --> 04:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
04:39:29.910 --> 04:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
but the current number is arbitrary you
 
04:39:31.750 --> 04:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
admit that is that right
 
04:39:33.510 --> 04:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
like i said i wasn't involved when that
 
04:39:35.910 --> 04:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
number was chosen um it probably there
 
04:39:37.750 --> 04:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
was some calculation that seemed to be
 
04:39:40.708 --> 04:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
logical at the time but again i was not
 
04:39:42.390 --> 04:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
here when that happened so i couldn't
 
04:39:45.270 --> 04:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
tell you but a lot of things in statute
 
04:39:46.948 --> 04:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
and a rule do seem to be fairly
 
04:39:49.670 --> 04:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
arbitrary i think the 2000 barrel limit
 
04:39:51.990 --> 04:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
the 2500 barrel limit we're sort of all
 
04:39:53.990 --> 04:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
sort of pie in the sky we just oh that
 
04:39:55.430 --> 04:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
sounds like a pretty good number let's
 
04:39:57.590 --> 04:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
let's go with it so i can't necessarily
 
04:39:59.830 --> 04:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
comment but i can tell you that
 
04:40:01.270 --> 04:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
based on the report the liquor
 
04:40:03.110 --> 04:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
commission did prior to the senate
 
04:40:05.430 --> 04:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
hearing they ran all these reports and
 
04:40:09.030 --> 04:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
nobody was bumping up against the limit
 
04:40:11.270 --> 04:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
i think i know how many how much beers
 
04:40:13.750 --> 04:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
in a in a keg big keg
 
04:40:15.590 --> 04:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh 50 liter keg
 
04:40:18.070 --> 04:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
like about seven cases worth of beer
 
04:40:20.550 --> 04:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
seven 24 12 ounce cases all right i
 
04:40:21.990 --> 04:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
remember somehow i remember clark
 
04:40:24.150 --> 04:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
talking about cases of a keg of a beer
 
04:40:24.160 --> 04:40:26.070 align:start position:0%
talking about cases of a keg of a beer
but

04:40:26.070 --> 04:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:40:27.670 --> 04:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's as good as my
 
04:40:29.590 --> 04:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
memory will let me go i'm right there
 
04:40:31.350 --> 04:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
with you okay
 
04:40:32.628 --> 04:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:40:34.390 --> 04:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
04:40:35.910 --> 04:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
you so anybody else would like to
 
04:40:39.110 --> 04:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
testify on senate bill 340.
 
04:40:43.510 --> 04:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:45.590 --> 04:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:40:45.600 --> 04:40:46.470 align:start position:0%
we have
uh

04:40:46.470 --> 04:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:40:48.390 --> 04:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
three in support and one person who is
 
04:40:48.400 --> 04:40:50.230 align:start position:0%
three in support and one person who is
neutral

04:40:50.230 --> 04:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
04:40:52.708 --> 04:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
neutral oh jamie burnett
 
04:40:55.350 --> 04:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
the wine institute okay
 
04:40:57.190 --> 04:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
all right and with that we'll close the
 
04:40:58.788 --> 04:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
04:41:01.350 --> 04:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
and that's it for our public hearings so
 
04:41:02.550 --> 04:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
as everybody knows we've got
 
04:41:05.190 --> 04:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittees tomorrow
 
04:41:07.750 --> 04:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh and theoretically we'll try to get
 
04:41:09.910 --> 04:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
through everything that we have i've
 
04:41:12.230 --> 04:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
scheduled an exec session for next
 
04:41:14.708 --> 04:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
wednesday afternoon
 
04:41:15.910 --> 04:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
that leaves
 
04:41:17.910 --> 04:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
potentially wednesday morning open for
 
04:41:19.990 --> 04:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
anything that doesn't get resolved
 
04:41:20.000 --> 04:41:21.590 align:start position:0%
anything that doesn't get resolved
tomorrow

04:41:21.590 --> 04:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
04:41:21.600 --> 04:41:22.708 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
and

04:41:22.708 --> 04:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:41:24.150 --> 04:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
these are all scheduled for the
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
subcommittee tomorrow uh so anything
 
04:41:28.628 --> 04:41:28.638 align:start position:0%
that gets left is a loose end we can
 
04:41:30.788 --> 04:41:30.798 align:start position:0%
still do it and
 
04:41:33.030 --> 04:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
and still this gives us some time before
 
04:41:34.628 --> 04:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
uh we have to have every bill out of
 
04:41:34.638 --> 04:41:43.910 align:start position:0%
uh we have to have every bill out of
committee

04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:43.920 --> 04:41:44.788 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:41:44.788 --> 04:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:41:46.310 --> 04:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i i
 
04:41:48.310 --> 04:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
you know yeah i guess i didn't pay
 
04:41:49.910 --> 04:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
enough attention to the order that they
 
04:41:51.910 --> 04:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
were in the vast majority of the bills
 
04:41:53.990 --> 04:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
we had we had where we didn't we didn't
 
04:41:55.270 --> 04:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
have too many liquor bills there was
 
04:41:57.590 --> 04:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
just what had you know two of them
 
04:41:59.590 --> 04:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
so so that they were just kind of thrown
 
04:42:01.990 --> 04:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
in um but you know about most is
 
04:42:04.788 --> 04:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
insurance in business so but i i really
 
04:42:06.788 --> 04:42:06.798 align:start position:0%
urge everyone to show up and just you
 
04:42:08.230 --> 04:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
know just to follow what we're doing and
 
04:42:11.110 --> 04:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
where we're at and and and we we allow
 
04:42:13.670 --> 04:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
everybody to participate and you know
 
04:42:15.190 --> 04:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
obviously when it gets to the actual
 
04:42:17.350 --> 04:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
voting mode of the subcommittee it's
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
