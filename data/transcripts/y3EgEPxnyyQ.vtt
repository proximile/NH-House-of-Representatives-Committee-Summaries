yes

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 align:start position:0%
yes is this better oh
 
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
hot mic hot mic all right well good
 
00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 align:start position:0%
morning everybody I thought uh what we
 
00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.469 align:start position:0%
morning everybody I thought uh what we
do

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.190 align:start position:0%
do
um

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
Lord knows I love a great visual
 
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 align:start position:0%
presentation so I actually I think we're
 
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 align:start position:0%
going to put a few things up on the
 
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 align:start position:0%
screens just to so people get a sense of
 
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
of the trends we're not I don't want to
 
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
get overly wonky uh about it but
 
00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
obviously we're here to answer any
 
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
questions that that you may have in
 
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
terms of what was proposed yesterday and
 
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
and all the various aspects of what the
 
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
legislature will be taking up so let's
 
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
start with something beyond the title
 
00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
page where are we oh I'm sorry I
 
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 align:start position:0%
apologize so let me first probably start
 
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
by introducing James Gary I'm my budget
 
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.470 align:start position:0%
by introducing James Gary I'm my budget
director

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
um four budgets four budget directors
 
00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
and it all seems to be going very well
 
00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.970 align:start position:0%
and it all seems to be going very well
so

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 align:start position:0%
um James has been working on this budget
 
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
uh from the really the very beginning
 
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
which as a lot of you know starts uh
 
00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
last summer right when we start putting
 
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
out the request for efficiency
 
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
um and then that builds into its uh
 
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
request for prioritized needs from all
 
00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
the different departments go through
 
00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
James and our teams go through with each
 
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
of them about priorities then we start
 
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
looking at where revenue is coming in uh
 
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
what is going to be available in the
 
00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 align:start position:0%
current Surplus the end of the fiscal
 
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
year 23 as well as uh what opportunities
 
00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
what lapses might look like and
 
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 align:start position:0%
opportunities will look like a couple
 
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 align:start position:0%
years down the road and I think as a lot
 
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
of folks know I really try to take a
 
00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
long-term Vision on all this stuff as we
 
00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 align:start position:0%
deal with the budget and short-term
 
00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 align:start position:0%
needs of course but hopefully a
 
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
long-term Vision because whatever you do
 
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
in the next couple years you want it to
 
00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
be sustainable right most everything
 
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
that we do needs to be sustainable in in
 
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 align:start position:0%
some in some form I'll say that I think
 
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 align:start position:0%
all the I don't want to speak for all
 
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
them directly but I'll say every
 
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
Department worked really really well
 
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 align:start position:0%
with us
 
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
obviously Health and Human Services is
 
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
represents 40 or so 40 plus percent of
 
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
the state budget it's huge
 
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
um as many of you know commissioner
 
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.289 align:start position:0%
um as many of you know commissioner
shibanet

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 align:start position:0%
shibanet
 
00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 align:start position:0%
has moved on God bless her after
 
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
everything she gave the state uh but
 
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
commission interim commissioner Weaver
 
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
and her team there are exceptional they
 
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
really are uh they've been phenomenal to
 
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
work with uh Nathan who is the new uh
 
00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 align:start position:0%
CFO there came up through the contracts
 
00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 align:start position:0%
process so as big and sometimes unwieldy
 
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
as that department can seem I will say
 
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
we have a very good team there and and I
 
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
think we'll be able to answer a lot of
 
00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 align:start position:0%
the questions
 
00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 align:start position:0%
um both directly and I think again their
 
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
presentations to the various committees
 
00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 align:start position:0%
as we go through the budget process will
 
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
be will be very productive so let's
 
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
start with big picture here so what you
 
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
see there is our Revenue State revenues
 
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
that have come in uh going all the way
 
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
back to 2014 just so folks can kind of
 
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 align:start position:0%
get a sense of it this goes out to 2025
 
00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 align:start position:0%
so if you look at that that uh bar all
 
00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
the way at the right those last two are
 
00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 that's where we are kind of
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
predicting the state's revenues will go
 
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
and what we're really predicting is of
 
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
about a half a percent or slight
 
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
decrease in state revenues we're not
 
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
being overly ambitious about the
 
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
revenues we've had all-time high-end
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
revenues as everybody knows I think
 
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
there'll be a stagnation in the economy
 
00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 align:start position:0%
nationally it might be a little bump in
 
00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
the road for us because our economy is
 
00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
incredibly strong here as everybody
 
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
knows businesses continue to come in we
 
00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 align:start position:0%
continue to have Workforce challenges as
 
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
everybody does that's a tough problem
 
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
not a good problem to have but it does
 
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
mean you have an incredibly robust
 
00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 align:start position:0%
economy with a lot of opportunity and we
 
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
can get into how we're dealing with that
 
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
but let's just to start on revenues we
 
00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
effectively are saying revenues are
 
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
going to level out and even go down just
 
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 align:start position:0%
a little bit so we're trying to be
 
00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
conservative if things are better that's
 
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
great right if things keep going up a
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
little bit because we are one of the
 
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
strongest economies in the country the
 
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 align:start position:0%
recession doesn't hit the country as
 
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
hard as we think that would be
 
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
phenomenal and and we'll have a lot of
 
00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity at the end but everything we
 
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
build here is balanced and everything we
 
00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
build here is living within those
 
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%
um and just as a little bit just before
 
00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 align:start position:0%
we go on from that well we can but just
 
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
they're letting me use the computer
 
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
that's a dangerous thing
 
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
um just to give some perspective in 2022
 
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
General funds and education trust funds
 
00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:01.699 align:start position:0%
exceeded expectations exceeded Plans by
 
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
15.4 percent and 23 they exceeded Plans
 
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
by 17.4 percent so that's that's the
 
00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
aggressive nature of our revenues that
 
00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 align:start position:0%
we're talking about not being
 
00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
sustainable and really we shouldn't be
 
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
planning on that uh in any way if it
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
happens that would be great that means
 
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
business continues to be out of this
 
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
world but I think we're we're trying to
 
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
take a more practical measure so we're
 
00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 align:start position:0%
seeing we're going to likely level off
 
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
from that uh as you'll see most places
 
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
do across the country
 
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
and we are projecting technically a
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
surplus a continued Surplus when you
 
00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:34.259 align:start position:0%
take out all the things that have been
 
00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 align:start position:0%
spent through Appropriations through
 
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
last year and
 
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
um and this year we still expect to have
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
a surplus to close out this year of 330
 
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars that's after all the
 
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
expense the Surplus expenditures that
 
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
have already been made
 
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
um the totals the total Surplus over
 
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
plan is well north of 500 million I
 
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
believe correct yes it is it's well
 
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
north of 500 million a lot of that has
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
already been allocated but we still have
 
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
300 million dollars in one-time funds
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed as part of
 
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
this uh next six month period before we
 
00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 align:start position:0%
close out the books on 23. okay so let's
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
look at the revenues I'm not going to go
 
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
into oh I'll do it yeah sorry great I'm
 
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
not going to go this is just a a very
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
General Revenue chart I don't expect
 
00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:17.699 align:start position:0%
everyone to see this but I only put this
 
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
this up uh to show you know of the
 
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.010 align:start position:0%
this up uh to show you know of the
um

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
20 or so different 20 plus different
 
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
revenue streams we have we really do
 
00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
look at each one individually uh we
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
really try to take uh each one as as
 
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
they come in terms of their
 
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.249 align:start position:0%
they come in terms of their
opportunities

00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:34.259 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
um that's where I we really came up with
 
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunity I think to eliminate the
 
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
communications tax uh as we discussed
 
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:42.300 align:start position:0%
yesterday this is a tax that is
 
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
essentially a tax on everybody's phone
 
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
calls the revenues from it continually
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
decrease because less people are
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
actually using phone calls they're not
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
Based on data uh and so as those
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
revenues decrease we have a lot of a
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility there and I just think the
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
idea that we're going to tax people's
 
00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:00.419 align:start position:0%
phone calls is uh old Antiquated and
 
00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
more importantly unnecessary right and I
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
always go back to that Axiom it's it's
 
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
the the citizens money it's not ours if
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
we don't need as much of it uh give it
 
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
back to them in some form so this is uh
 
00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:11.699 align:start position:0%
one opportunity I think that is
 
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
definitely on the table and is being
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
proposed to eliminate the communications
 
00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:18.419 align:start position:0%
tax the communication Services tax uh
 
00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:20.570 align:start position:0%
tax the communication Services tax uh
completely

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
completely
 
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
um moving on from that
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
so some of the more significant items uh
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
just in terms of the uh the general fund
 
00:08:29.089 --> 00:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
the operational items within the general
 
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
fund a lot of things that and I don't
 
00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
mean to be overly repetitive as to what
 
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
was discussed yesterday but a lot of
 
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
things that we we some of the bigger
 
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
ticket items is number one you can have
 
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
all the programs and funding in the
 
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
world uh but if you don't have the
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
people behind them it doesn't work uh
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
and you can look at issues of mental
 
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
health or issues of treatment and
 
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
recovery so often in these areas we have
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
the money there's there those a lot of a
 
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
lot of mental health organizations in
 
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
the state that have plenty of cash right
 
00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
now but they just can't find people
 
00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
right and if you don't have the people
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
you can't Prime up the services same
 
00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
with the DD Community as well if you
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't have the people you can't find the
 
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
service well the state is not immune
 
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
from that and so we worked out uh with
 
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
the unions a very successful negotiation
 
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
with all the different unions that we
 
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
have to deal with obviously SEIU is one
 
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
of the bigger ones but there are many
 
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
unions in the state that we worked
 
00:09:18.889 --> 00:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
worked out with a 10 raise across the
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
board uh starting on July 1st and then
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
another two percent in the second year
 
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
of the Buy Union that 10 is as a lot of
 
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
you've probably heard by now does
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
represent the largest single year raise
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
ever given to the state employees but
 
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
this is we're dealing with the largest
 
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
inflationary pressures in the last 40 or
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
50 years so
 
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
um it it is para pursue if you will with
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh the needs of the state and and the
 
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
Dynamics of our incredibly robust
 
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
economy I'll remind folks that when we
 
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
did have inflation like this uh back in
 
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
the 1980-ish area uh the economy was in
 
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
horrible shape right and not only did
 
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
they have high inflation but they had an
 
00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:55.019 align:start position:0%
incredibly weak economy 1980 and 81 were
 
00:09:56.449 --> 00:09:56.459 align:start position:0%
years a lot of people would economically
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
like to forget before we really came out
 
00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:01.019 align:start position:0%
of it in 83 and 84. so uh we have a
 
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
strong economy we have the opportunity
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh and so you know obviously that has to
 
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
be a major Endeavor as we go forward uh
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates uh that we kind of
 
00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:11.459 align:start position:0%
listened to the legislature on this one
 
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
a lot of The Advocates have been talking
 
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
to the legislature uh the Senate the
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
house members everyone came back and
 
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
said yeah uh three they recommended a
 
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent right three point one
 
00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339 align:start position:0%
percent across the board so we were able
 
00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
to build that in we have the opportunity
 
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
let's just get it done and make it easy
 
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
I think there's opportunities even
 
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
beyond what we do there as well and
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's something that we have to look at
 
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
I think I you know we assume in this
 
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
budget that Medicaid expansion will get
 
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
reauthorized as it should I think it
 
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
should frankly be reauthorized into
 
00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:41.339 align:start position:0%
perpetuity but that's really a
 
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
legislative decision
 
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
um uh but I we we're making that
 
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
assumption and it seems like that is all
 
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
well on track
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
um another big thing that we talked
 
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.750 align:start position:0%
um another big thing that we talked
about

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:10:53.449 --> 00:10:53.459 align:start position:0%
uh let me back up a little bit um yeah
 
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
let's just jump into oplc why not so
 
00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
oplc licensure reform right so you know
 
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
this is going to be really hard and
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
contentious it always is in the
 
00:11:03.769 --> 00:11:03.779 align:start position:0%
legislature I don't think what I'm
 
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
proposing is uh is just uh you know
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
should be rubber stamped by any means
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
but if you wanted to I'm not going to
 
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
complain uh because uh you know as the
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
governor I always have the right answer
 
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.790 align:start position:0%
governor I always have the right answer
right

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
um there's a there's a lot here there's
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
a lot here and a lot to unpack and I do
 
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
encourage uh whoever whatever committees
 
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
and I'm not even 100 sure that will will
 
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
take all of these up it could be pretty
 
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
much all the Committees in one way or
 
00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:26.579 align:start position:0%
the other we'll probably get uh an
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
earful I'm sure from a lot of different
 
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
folks and I get it I get the the idea of
 
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
why a lot of this stuff was put in place
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
in the first place but it has become so
 
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
cumbersome so unwieldy I think Lindsay
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
Courtney over at oplc does a phenomenal
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
job trying to manage 54 different boards
 
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
with 54 different processes with 54
 
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
different ways of getting licenses many
 
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
of licenses that are Antiquated out of
 
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
date and if I can be learned about it
 
00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
just protectionism and that is the worst
 
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
kind of government when you encourage
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
folks in the private sector to create
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
rules simply to protect their own
 
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
fiefdoms and that's what you have here
 
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
in a lot of instances so um it's it's
 
00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
I'm not picking on any individual
 
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
they're all great people with great
 
00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:10.019 align:start position:0%
businesses it's wonderful but um clearly
 
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of it was designed to make it
 
00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:14.579 align:start position:0%
difficult for folks from other states to
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
move their business here or to create
 
00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
their opportunity here in the fear that
 
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:19.740 align:start position:0%
they may take a client or whatever it
 
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
might be we are at a point where we want
 
00:12:23.329 --> 00:12:23.339 align:start position:0%
all the business we can we can get we
 
00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:24.839 align:start position:0%
want all the private sector we can get
 
00:12:24.839 --> 00:12:26.690 align:start position:0%
want all the private sector we can get
and

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:26.700 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
frankly whether the economy is strong
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
where the economy is weak it doesn't
 
00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:32.519 align:start position:0%
matter in good times and bad our license
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
plate always says Live Free or Die I
 
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
mean that is truly how we have to govern
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
here we can differ differ as Republicans
 
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
and Democrats on different issues of
 
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
course but we really have to remember
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
that this is about individual
 
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
opportunities and freedoms and all of
 
00:12:45.889 --> 00:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
that that sort of thing is very
 
00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:46.850 align:start position:0%
that that sort of thing is very
important

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:12:49.129 --> 00:12:49.139 align:start position:0%
and so when you look at all of it we're
 
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:50.519 align:start position:0%
kind of taking a wholesale approach
 
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
we're not just asking the same change
 
00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
for everyone Lindsay and her team went
 
00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:56.700 align:start position:0%
through each and every single license
 
00:12:59.329 --> 00:12:59.339 align:start position:0%
each and every single board one by one
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
some boards you know some of the more
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
Global things we're trying to do to
 
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
start with is we're trying to bring the
 
00:13:06.889 --> 00:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
size of the boards down
 
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh if for anything because so many of
 
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
these boards will tell us they can't
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
meet because they don't have a quorum if
 
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
the board is too big it's it's much more
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
difficult to actually get a quorum some
 
00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
of these boards only will review the
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
um the licensure uh complaints or
 
00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:23.339 align:start position:0%
appeals or whatever it is when they have
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
a quorum and when they all meet and it's
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
just becoming too difficult so the
 
00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:29.339 align:start position:0%
entire process gets held up and then we
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
we get complaints well New Hampshire's
 
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy is slowing things down it's
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
not so much the bureaucracy slowing
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
things down is that our system is is
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
really isn't designed to be as
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
successful as it could be in those areas
 
00:13:40.079 --> 00:13:41.090 align:start position:0%
successful as it could be in those areas
so

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
um director Courtney went through and
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
really looked at each one of these I'm
 
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
sure she'll come in and testify on all
 
00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
of them uh about the house and why some
 
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
move to more an advisory role some
 
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
licenses we get rid of altogether I mean
 
00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
the the obvious uh example I will give
 
00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
is that technically I never say the
 
00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
internet in tournament license I'm not
 
00:14:00.769 --> 00:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
going to say that word right
 
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:02.700 align:start position:0%
what is it
 
00:14:05.449 --> 00:14:05.459 align:start position:0%
itinerant yeah technically look you need
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
a license to basically go door to door
 
00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
right so are we going to start locking
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
up all the Girl Scouts right come on so
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
nobody it's like let's just get that
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
thing that kind of thing off the book
 
00:14:15.949 --> 00:14:15.959 align:start position:0%
The Hawkers and Peddler's license I
 
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
please you want to Hawk something you
 
00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
want to Pedal something first you can
 
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
start by telling me the difference I'm
 
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
sure there's some dictionary difference
 
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
in there but the point is some of this
 
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
is really Antiquated it's right that was
 
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
a run out of the Secretary of State's
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
office so my point there is that there's
 
00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
a real opportunity not just to go after
 
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
the the cosmetologist not just to go
 
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
after the medical review board not just
 
00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
to go after this group or that group but
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
really take them as a whole because it
 
00:14:41.689 --> 00:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
is becoming so a cumbersome and unwieldy
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
and now that we have a process by which
 
00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
everything is flowing through oplc it's
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
a great opportunity to really provide
 
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
oversight uh and Synergy uh between all
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
those different processes the other
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
thing is and it doesn't take away the
 
00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:56.459 align:start position:0%
authority it's not so much taking
 
00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:58.740 align:start position:0%
Authority away from these boards um it's
 
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's allowing the administrative
 
00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
processes that oplc has to do to work on
 
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
on a more streamlined basis of course
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
and the boards have to have a voice they
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
have to have that representation but uh
 
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
too often you have boards that are that
 
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:13.740 align:start position:0%
if I may I don't want to say I'm more
 
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
that take on a much more serious role
 
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
than others in terms of the medical
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
review board right the nursing licensing
 
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
board these are these are boards that if
 
00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
you don't get it right lives are at risk
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
and we've seen that not go well in this
 
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:29.220 align:start position:0%
state in the past couple years
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
um we've read some of these examples in
 
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:32.220 align:start position:0%
the paper where the boards aren't
 
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
meeting where things aren't being
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
reviewed where things aren't transparent
 
00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
our peels aren't being processed you
 
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
can't we can't do that anymore we really
 
00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:40.019 align:start position:0%
have to kind of take a wholesale
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
approach to oplc in the boards and and
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully make some changes and I'm sure
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
there'll be a lot of other really good
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
ideas thrown into the mix but it's
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
something that as a state
 
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
um getting rid of this 14 unnecessary
 
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.069 align:start position:0%
um getting rid of this 14 unnecessary
boards

00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
um 34 different licenses types that
 
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
we're recommending to get rid of we have
 
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
 
00:15:59.689 --> 00:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
licenses in the State uh in terms of the
 
00:16:01.009 --> 00:16:01.019 align:start position:0%
private sector we are one of the most
 
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
over-regulated states in the country so
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
let's kind of start there and see if we
 
00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
can't chip away and work back and create
 
00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:08.420 align:start position:0%
some efficiencies through that process
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
we put some significant uh increases for
 
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
UNH here both in terms of their
 
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:17.220 align:start position:0%
operational requests as well as the
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
community college so
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
I gotta say uh without you know
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
fanboying too much I think president
 
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
Dean has done a fantastic job on a
 
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
variety of levels so president Dean has
 
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:28.740 align:start position:0%
come in one of the first things he did
 
00:16:31.009 --> 00:16:31.019 align:start position:0%
is he hired an outside consultant this
 
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
group came in and gave him a huge report
 
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
on potential efficiencies streamlining
 
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:38.220 align:start position:0%
processes cutting of costs in the
 
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:40.259 align:start position:0%
University system and they didn't put to
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
their credit they didn't put the report
 
00:16:44.449 --> 00:16:44.459 align:start position:0%
in a drawer they really took action on a
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
lot of it they did the buyout Provisions
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
with a lot of their um uh uh faculty and
 
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
that has saved them millions in tens and
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
tens of millions of dollars Catherine
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
preventers over there our former State
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
Treasurer she's got a great handle on
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
the finances I think there's a very
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
solid team there when you look at the
 
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
cost uh the not the just the tuition
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
rate we know tuition's High always has
 
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
been and unfortunately likely will be in
 
00:17:09.169 --> 00:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
the future but the fact that they have
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
Frozen tuition now for five straight
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
years is a testament to their management
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that they've put these
 
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
efficiencies in they've cut their costs
 
00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
and still maintain some of the lowest
 
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
costs around pursue student I think is
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
is absolutely terrific in terms of what
 
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
they've done so we've met there when we
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
go through as to the hows and whys if
 
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
they want some operational increase from
 
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
the legislature I agree with it
 
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly I think there's some
 
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
other Investments we can make there and
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
I will talk about that on the capital
 
00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:36.299 align:start position:0%
and uh Surplus side same with the
 
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
Community College I think they've done
 
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
they've done very very well over there
 
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
we're never going to get our tuition
 
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
rates you know this is New England New
 
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
England is always going to have a fairly
 
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
High tuition rates unfortunately Vermont
 
00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:49.100 align:start position:0%
has I think even higher rates than us
 
00:17:51.169 --> 00:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
but like I said the fact that they've
 
00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
Frozen these rates for five straight
 
00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:54.419 align:start position:0%
years now I think is a great Testament
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
to their management and that's why again
 
00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
we I feel very confident moving forward
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
with some of the increases they're
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
looking for in their operational funds
 
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
you know something that didn't get
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
talked about too much but I just threw
 
00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
in here at the last second we need a new
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
Men's prison
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
um desperately we saw what happened with
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
the women's prison years ago when we
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
left it uh too long we got sued and
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
probably rightfully so we were getting
 
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
sued because it was in deplorable
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
condition and it wasn't easy but we
 
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
worked hard and we got that that new
 
00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
facility done and it's been running
 
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
fantastic since the Men's prison is
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
really right on the edge now this is not
 
00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
a small price tag you are talking
 
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
minimum 350 to 450 million dollars so
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
this is a long-term investment the state
 
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
is going to make what I am proposing
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
um how the state wants to look at
 
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
bonding that down the road I think
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's a bigger discussion but what I'm
 
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
proposing is is it 40 or 50. 40 plus 10
 
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
right yeah 50 million dollars total
 
00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh 40 out of the operational side of the
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
budget 10 out of the is it the Surplus
 
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.270 align:start position:0%
budget 10 out of the is it the Surplus
side

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
um 50 million dollars total to really
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
set a marker to start everything from
 
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
architectural design planning
 
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
feasibility uh what the size should be
 
00:19:06.409 --> 00:19:06.419 align:start position:0%
get all those things that have to happen
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
and get the ball moving how it would be
 
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
laid out how it would be done and then I
 
00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:12.299 align:start position:0%
proposed that's about the first 10
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
million and then there's another 40
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
million in this budget that kind of sets
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
a Mark or maybe even starts on on
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
building phase one I think we have to if
 
00:19:21.169 --> 00:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
you will put a shovel in the ground to
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're committing all the
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
way through and then again the
 
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
Consultants can come in and figure out
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
how best to design and make this
 
00:19:30.049 --> 00:19:30.059 align:start position:0%
efficient but this is a very very major
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
infrastructure project that the state
 
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
has to take on cannot really avoid it
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
much longer and um we had we have funds
 
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
right now right we have the opportunity
 
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
so whether it's looking at bonding for
 
00:19:42.169 --> 00:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
the long term which again you got to
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
look at rates and what that would be but
 
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
taking some of our our money today that
 
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
we do have flexibility with putting that
 
00:19:48.529 --> 00:19:48.539 align:start position:0%
marker in the ground getting the project
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
moving knowing it it could be a four or
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
five six to your Endeavor for the state
 
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
to get us where we really need to be and
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
the other piece I'll throw out here and
 
00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
we can take questions on any of it but
 
00:20:00.289 --> 00:20:00.299 align:start position:0%
um well just like look like I said
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
virtually every state agency so we go
 
00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
through this efficiency budget which is
 
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
what do you need to keep your your
 
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799 align:start position:0%
department running minimally and then we
 
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
kind of look at all the additional
 
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
add-ons where we can find efficiencies
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
spending a lot of times I challenge my
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
departments to say look tell me where
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
you can spend more one-time money so we
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
need less employees right where we we
 
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
have a lack of employees or a lack of
 
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
service maybe we invest in a technology
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
we invest in a process we invest in
 
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
something with this one these one-time
 
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
funds we have uh to take some of the I
 
00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
mean our workers are are putting
 
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
everything they got into their days
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
there's just no doubt about that we have
 
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
staff in certain departments for staff
 
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:38.700 align:start position:0%
that are doing the work of of 10 and so
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
again if we can make an investment there
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
knowing that we might get four staff to
 
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
six or seven but we might not be able to
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
get to to full capacity maybe there's
 
00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
Investments we can make in one-time
 
00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
Technologies are opportunities and we
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
really challenge them with that when we
 
00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:54.059 align:start position:0%
look at their prior prioritized needs
 
00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
but obviously the prioritized needs come
 
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
in a variety of different forms
 
00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's some of the bigger
 
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
I'll just say the bigger ticket items on
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:09.299 align:start position:0%
Let's Talk education so this is this is
 
00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
a little complicated but and I'm going
 
00:21:12.529 --> 00:21:12.539 align:start position:0%
to do my best because Lord knows I want
 
00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:13.559 align:start position:0%
to run over there and point at
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
everything I need one of those virtual
 
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.570 align:start position:0%
everything I need one of those virtual
pointers

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:16.580 align:start position:0%
pointers
 
00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
what I'm showing here is the very
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
complicated formula that we use to fund
 
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.909 align:start position:0%
complicated formula that we use to fund
education

00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:22.919 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
so phase one what you see at the top is
 
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
what we call the left side of the form
 
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
and I'm telling I know a lot of you guys
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
understand this so so bear with me but
 
00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
just as a review right we could all use
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
a little review sometimes you know the
 
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
left side of the formula is everything
 
00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
you see in blue and that's our number of
 
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
students times the base adequacy we give
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
per student the number of special ed
 
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
kids uh with with their dollars the
 
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
number of ESL kids we have a reading
 
00:21:48.409 --> 00:21:48.419 align:start position:0%
Grant in there we have free and reduced
 
00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
lunch in there those are the five big
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
pieces with fixed amounts that we give
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
to each School based on on the number of
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
students that they have
 
00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
we then do the swept calculation and
 
00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
that's what you see in the black on the
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
second row we take the total calculated
 
00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:05.700 align:start position:0%
cost of an adequate education we take
 
00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
out the Statewide property tax most
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
towns are at least a large variety of
 
00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
towns have have no change and they're
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
fine they basically hold on to their
 
00:22:15.649 --> 00:22:15.659 align:start position:0%
their their local property taxes a lot
 
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
of towns need some additional funds and
 
00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
we put some more money in through the
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
the swept process and then you get to
 
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
the bottom and obviously I'm going
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
pretty quick through this then you get
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
to the bottom which is the right side of
 
00:22:27.529 --> 00:22:27.539 align:start position:0%
the formula this is where the
 
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
legislature over the past 16 years I
 
00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
call this the Band-Aids we just keep
 
00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
band-aiding on fixes right and and each
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
band-aid's a little different each
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid is a little more complicated
 
00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
than the last and and this is where I
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of opportunity to
 
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.470 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of opportunity to
simplify

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
simplify
 
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
because when what I found and again I've
 
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
I'm I've gone through this four times
 
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
now and what I found is that whenever we
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
talk about this the solution is another
 
00:22:54.409 --> 00:22:54.419 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid without really looking at how
 
00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
the other Band-Aids are working are not
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
working right you know what and it's
 
00:23:00.169 --> 00:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
work it's hard I get it none of this is
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
easy and and we're going to get to the
 
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:03.900 align:start position:0%
concept of spreadsheet Wars in a minute
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
and you guys are going to have some fun
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
with that I'm sure but
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
this is my fundamental problem is that
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
not only is it an overly complicated
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
system equation I mean look at all the
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
different variables that go into that
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
then you add in you know normalized
 
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
property valuations and all of that sort
 
00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
of thing that are buried in each of
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
those some of those little pieces to ask
 
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
anyone outside of Concord to understand
 
00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
appreciate or have valuable input into
 
00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:29.700 align:start position:0%
how this could be better is almost
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
impossible I mean it's really almost too
 
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
much to ask anyone you know
 
00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
well I was going to pick on Bill
 
00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
ardinger you know and people like that
 
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
really really amazingly smart people
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
that spend all their days on this stuff
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
get it but very few others very few
 
00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:43.580 align:start position:0%
others really understand it so
 
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
conceptually I said well let's simplify
 
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
the other issue we really have
 
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we put it in here I
 
00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:51.539 align:start position:0%
don't know we didn't okay let me back up
 
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
the other issue that we really have is
 
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
for the first time and this is the
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
fundamental difference why I think the
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
opportunity today is so critical on on
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
the education formula we have never had
 
00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:03.419 align:start position:0%
an education trust fund Surplus like
 
00:24:03.419 --> 00:24:04.130 align:start position:0%
an education trust fund Surplus like
this

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
I mean in some years we have five
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
million or 10 million dollars do you
 
00:24:09.409 --> 00:24:09.419 align:start position:0%
know what the numbers today technically
 
00:24:09.419 --> 00:24:10.570 align:start position:0%
know what the numbers today technically
100

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:10.580 align:start position:0%
100
 
00:24:13.549 --> 00:24:13.559 align:start position:0%
170 million dollars that if we do
 
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
nothing is going to just keep growing
 
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
right so that sir and that Surplus can
 
00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:19.559 align:start position:0%
really only be spent on education right
 
00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:21.059 align:start position:0%
you can't use it for anything else and
 
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
nor should you so it's not just the
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hopefully challenge
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
ourselves to make some bigger changes
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
and and and find some Simplicity but the
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
need because otherwise you're going to
 
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
have all this money just sitting on the
 
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
sidelines and that's a that's a huge
 
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
waste and missed opportunity okay so let
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
me take you through this a little bit
 
00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:42.059 align:start position:0%
oh what would I do oh no I'm going
 
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
backwards hold on there we go so what
 
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
you'll see I do with the first piece
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
here is we take the base amount that we
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
give right now our base Aid amount which
 
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
is right now off the top my head I think
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
is 38.66 and I start just in year one
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
right away we move that to 4 700 that's
 
00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
about a 24 increase just on day one
 
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
uh no that's with the CPI piece put in
 
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
at the end of the biennium right yes
 
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so the 40s sorry I'm gonna let
 
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
let's reverse all that
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
I take the base amount I move it to 4
 
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
700 that's true that's about a 21.5
 
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
increase to be fair
 
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced lunch amount move
 
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:25.740 align:start position:0%
that to 2500 right that's up in the
 
00:25:27.529 --> 00:25:27.539 align:start position:0%
upper 20 so I'll explain why these
 
00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
numbers are a little different
 
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
the other big piece here and why the
 
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
numbers you're seeing are a little
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
different is that what I realized and I
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
have to admit I didn't know this is how
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
CPI and the inflationary aspects of
 
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
those amounts was calculated we take a
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
three-year average of inflation
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
but we only allocate it every other year
 
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
so but inflation is cumulative if you're
 
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
not adding it in every year
 
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
your differential between the real costs
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
and what your funding gets bigger and
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
bigger and bigger so I think a
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
fundamental change that I I'm hoping
 
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
everybody has to agree with is we're
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
going to account for some sort of
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
inflationary piece every single year
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
because otherwise you're just giving
 
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
half of you're just accounting for half
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
of the inflationary costs each biennium
 
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
and your Delta is going to continue
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
getting bigger and you're going to keep
 
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
them going to have to come back for
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
Band-Aids so the 24 and 30 percent
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
you're seeing there is when you put in
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
two percent inflation after the first
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
year you get to a 24 you get a little
 
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
more you get to like 48
 
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
34 or something and then each year after
 
00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:33.059 align:start position:0%
that you just keep the two percent
 
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
moving forward we can do that now I get
 
00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:37.559 align:start position:0%
maybe years ago you couldn't do that but
 
00:26:39.289 --> 00:26:39.299 align:start position:0%
we've built this out over 10 and 20
 
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
years and the model still keeps plenty
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
of cash at the end of the day right
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
there's still a good Financial cushion
 
00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
so we can build in inflationary
 
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
increases the right way the appropriate
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
way the Fairway and still not overly
 
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
drain the trust fund which I think is an
 
00:26:57.409 --> 00:26:57.419 align:start position:0%
exciting opportunity so that's why by
 
00:26:59.210 --> 00:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
the end of this biennium you'd have a 24
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
and a 30 increase in each of those two
 
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
core pieces and that does a whole
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
variety of things people have been
 
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
screaming about trying to do that for
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
years we have lost major lawsuits that
 
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
are being held up because we don't do
 
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
enough on that and right by that so I
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's a that's step one of the huge
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh that we have we also by
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
doing that we don't need I think it's
 
00:27:21.769 --> 00:27:21.779 align:start position:0%
the reading piece comes out right
 
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
reading this reading number that was
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
added in a third grade reading number
 
00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
that was added in years ago uh we we
 
00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
we're taking that out because that was
 
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
kind of the left side of the equation
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid that was put in years ago and
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
this kind of takes care of that into
 
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
perpetuity so it simplifies the left
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
side of the formula then you got to go
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
through your swept calculation and what
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
we call phase two there uh the same way
 
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
you always would but now we get to phase
 
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.590 align:start position:0%
you always would but now we get to phase
three

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
so what we did have let me show you what
 
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559 align:start position:0%
phase three was right you had all these
 
00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:52.850 align:start position:0%
phase three was right you had all these
pieces

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
and now we're moving here so
 
00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:57.419 align:start position:0%
we have this is the right side of the
 
00:27:59.690 --> 00:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
formula is what drives me crazy
 
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
the right side of the formula as many
 
00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
know but many may not is is really where
 
00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:06.059 align:start position:0%
we say well this formula that was
 
00:28:09.289 --> 00:28:09.299 align:start position:0%
created in 2006 uh we're never going to
 
00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
move it the right side of the formula
 
00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
creates stable it normally has
 
00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:15.950 align:start position:0%
creates stable it normally has
stabilization

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
stabilization
 
00:28:18.409 --> 00:28:18.419 align:start position:0%
uh and a couple other pieces in it that
 
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
are based off attendance of 2006.
 
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
it's based off property values of 2006.
 
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
so let's the thing that boggles my mind
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
is imagine when they created this
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
formula in 2006 they said we're going to
 
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
base it on attendance and property
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
evaluation of 1990.
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
that would be absurd right that'd be
 
00:28:42.409 --> 00:28:42.419 align:start position:0%
great why would you ever do that that's
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
literally what we're doing
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
so let's start there that that's a
 
00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
really really bad idea things change
 
00:28:51.169 --> 00:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
when why do the budget for the rest of
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
the state departments change we have to
 
00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:54.299 align:start position:0%
move money we have to make adjustments
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
we change our priorities we change our
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
needs we look at fluctuate you have to
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
make those changes it doesn't mean that
 
00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:00.299 align:start position:0%
everyone is going to keep getting
 
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
everything they want into perpetuity but
 
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
right now you are set up to do that and
 
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
that is unfair it's unequitable it's
 
00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
it's just a disastrous idea on many
 
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
levels I get that it was never easy to
 
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
do before but now we have this huge
 
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
education trust fund balance I'm going
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
to keep going back to that things are
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
really really different now
 
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
so what do I do I take all the pieces of
 
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
the right side of the formula and I
 
00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:24.539 align:start position:0%
basically move them we you did last year
 
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
something called extraordinary needs so
 
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
I said okay let's keep that one right
 
00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
let's keep one of these pieces because
 
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:31.740 align:start position:0%
that was really designed again as it
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
should be to make sure that towns that
 
00:29:36.169 --> 00:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
have lower property valuations if you
 
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
will the poor or towns that have you
 
00:29:39.649 --> 00:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
know that don't have the property values
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
and property tax income that other towns
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
might have I have a bigger bite at the
 
00:29:45.289 --> 00:29:45.299 align:start position:0%
Apple and that's fair I think that's
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
appropriate you should do that let's
 
00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
just keep it to one one formula though
 
00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
right that's kind of what I'm doing you
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
guys can jiggle with that and figure out
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
what the formula should be I think
 
00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs that you did last
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
year was a really good one so I picked
 
00:29:57.889 --> 00:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
that one
 
00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:00.059 align:start position:0%
now should we some of these towns may
 
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
lose some dollars that's obvious
 
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
um should we cut them off tomorrow no
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
this I don't do that I do create a hold
 
00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:09.059 align:start position:0%
harmless provision
 
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:10.740 align:start position:0%
so I create a whole harmless provision
 
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
and at about seven it starts at about 78
 
00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
million dollars right and then we slowly
 
00:30:18.529 --> 00:30:18.539 align:start position:0%
every two years you ratchet it down I my
 
00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
plan is to ratchet it down 20 percent
 
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
every two years over the next ten
 
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
hold harmless will go down 20 percent
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs each of those years
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
goes up fifty percent so we're kind of
 
00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
moving some of those whole harmless
 
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
dollars into the extraordinary needs so
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
the theory is at the end of ten years
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
you get to a point where you just have
 
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
the left side of the formula and
 
00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs on the right side
 
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
and that way it's simpler for the
 
00:30:45.409 --> 00:30:45.419 align:start position:0%
legislature to say look when we want to
 
00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
help a poorer town or we want we're
 
00:30:48.169 --> 00:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
going to do it through the extraordinary
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
needs piece not just keep adding 100
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
more pieces onto it and complicate it
 
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
I know this is a lot I do trust me I've
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
spent three months on it myself and I've
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
been knee-deep in it so I don't expect
 
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
it all to be super simple and obvious in
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
just one presentation but that's
 
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
fundamentally what I'm trying to get
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
here we have to do something for lower
 
00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
income towns but to say that we're just
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
going to keep I mean there are towns
 
00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
with 30 more than 30 percent less kids
 
00:31:15.529 --> 00:31:15.539 align:start position:0%
today than in 2006. I I get it they're
 
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
going to likely get some less money
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
they'll be they'll get this hold
 
00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
harmless provision in a major way and
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
they'll get some extraordinary needs
 
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
money and that'll keep growing for them
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
that'll be great but to say that we're
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
never going to change that is just
 
00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
I it's it's obvious right that that
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
obviously has to change
 
00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
let's go back to 1990. why 2006 why
 
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
don't we go back to the population and
 
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
property valuations of 19 see what
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
happens we've just kind of picked this
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
arbitrary year unintentionally but but
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where We've Ended up so
 
00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:45.059 align:start position:0%
hopefully we're willing to kind of take
 
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
on that challenge and and uh and and
 
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
move forward with it what are some of
 
00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:51.539 align:start position:0%
the bigger pieces I'm missing here James
 
00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
what happens oh yeah so what you're
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
seeing here is so let me back up so in
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
the first year you have on the bottom I
 
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
know you can't read it that's the the um
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs is in the middle
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
the hold harmless provision is on the
 
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.610 align:start position:0%
the hold harmless provision is on the
right

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's just extraordinary needs and hold
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
harmless and what I'm showing here is
 
00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
Boom we go to basically extraordinary
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
needs over the over the long term so
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
again it's just that's just showing the
 
00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
simplification and again I think the
 
00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
opportunity here is with that if you get
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
back to a I just do I did a two percent
 
00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
number on inflation it's actually
 
00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
probably too high but historically over
 
00:32:33.409 --> 00:32:33.419 align:start position:0%
the past 40 years inflation is two
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
percent I know we're in this very
 
00:32:36.649 --> 00:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
bizarre time right now but two percent
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
is really historically where you want is
 
00:32:42.049 --> 00:32:42.059 align:start position:0%
where inflation is maybe 1.5 percent but
 
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
with including that every single year
 
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:46.740 align:start position:0%
that's the opportunity to not to take
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
care of the this left side of the
 
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
formula and again with the huge increase
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
we're doing on free and reduced lunch
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
those that's typically a marker of of
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
the poorer towns and so they're going to
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
get huge increases per student on all of
 
00:33:00.169 --> 00:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
those areas in a fair and Equitable way
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
and so that again also helps them helps
 
00:33:03.889 --> 00:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
make sure that they are they're kept
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
whole so to say oh so here's a here's
 
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
the graph I was showing this is the
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
balance of the of the education trust
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
fund so you can see what we're dealing
 
00:33:15.289 --> 00:33:15.299 align:start position:0%
with here right so in the third bar from
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
the right is 2023 that's where we are
 
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
today now over time we we take down the
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh trust fund balance a little bit in 24
 
00:33:24.649 --> 00:33:24.659 align:start position:0%
and a little bit in 25. there's a huge
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do school building Aid I
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
take 75 million out of this trust fund
 
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.019 align:start position:0%
balance for school building Aid and
 
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
while we don't bring this all the way
 
00:33:36.289 --> 00:33:36.299 align:start position:0%
out to 2033 or 2034 there is still a
 
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
positive Surplus in this here's
 
00:33:39.409 --> 00:33:39.419 align:start position:0%
something else I'm going to add on that
 
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:40.860 align:start position:0%
I haven't brought to anybody's attention
 
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
yet I know the legislature is strongly
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
looking at doing automatic enrollment of
 
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch for Medicaid for
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
families on Medicaid
 
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:52.140 align:start position:0%
you can debate whether you should or
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do that my budget builds in
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
the opportunity that if you do that it's
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
all good it's I've created a cushion in
 
00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:01.019 align:start position:0%
here to financially sustain that without
 
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
having to mess with anything I'm kind of
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
assuming that you may do that I don't
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
know if you will but I'm assuming that
 
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:07.140 align:start position:0%
that may come to the table I know
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of support bipartisan
 
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
support for it so if it happens it's a
 
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
sorry Mark's here he's the brains behind
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
all this from uh from uh doe um it's
 
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
about 30 plus million a year if you
 
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
decided to automatically enroll every
 
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
Medicaid kid into free and reduced lunch
 
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
some states do it some don't we can we
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
can handle it without without messing
 
00:34:33.649 --> 00:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
with anything so I've built that cushion
 
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:38.690 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:38.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:40.609 --> 00:34:40.619 align:start position:0%
and here's just a number I sure brought
 
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
this is just this is just total
 
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
Appropriations to Public Schools all
 
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
albums are all yeah all schools right
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
this is all of our Appropriations we
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
give to all schools and again this is
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
done by biennium so the the bar you see
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
on the right is what I'm proposing
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
because we can I again we still have
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
money left in the bank even after making
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
these increases because of the
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
transformative decrease in in child
 
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
population which will likely decrease
 
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
one about one percent a year for the
 
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
next 10 years that's going to continue
 
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this next generation is
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
having less kids later in life that's a
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
fundamental Dynamic
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
um so we just have to appreciate that I
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
think in in the modeling as as we go
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
forward and that's why again some towns
 
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
are going to continue to oh I should say
 
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
again why we need to adjust this now
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
because that population differential is
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
going to keep growing for some towns
 
00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:32.099 align:start position:0%
even above and beyond Norms some
 
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
sometimes have gone up 30 population of
 
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
students sometimes have gone down
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
Windham is a good example I think
 
00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
they're up like 30 35 percent you know
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
and obviously we'd all know the story of
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
Berlin it's it's boy they go through a
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
lot of troubles I have a lot of empathy
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
and sympathy I spent a lot of time up
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
there but they're down 35 percent you
 
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
know there's other towns too it's not
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
just them so you just have to we have to
 
00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
understand those are just very different
 
00:35:56.089 --> 00:35:56.099 align:start position:0%
Dynamics My Hope as an aside is that a
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
lot of these districts will be
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
incentivized through the school building
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
Aid to consolidate
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
I mean that's what you need in a lot of
 
00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
instances not every instance but in a
 
00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
lot of instances
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
um you know Berlin High School is
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
probably a good example I'm not I'm not
 
00:36:10.609 --> 00:36:10.619 align:start position:0%
picking on Berlin at all I think it's a
 
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
huge opportunity to say hey let's make
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
an investment and find a way to put
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
Gorham and Berlin together or something
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
like that there's probably 10 other
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
similar examples across the state if a
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
town wants to retain their school that's
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
fine if they you know want that
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
individuality I think it's awesome I
 
00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
live in a really tiny town of newfields
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
1500 people I hope we don't lose our
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
elementary school if we choose not to
 
00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
consolidate with somebody else but again
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
the fact that everyone else is going to
 
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
pay for that choice at an exorbitant
 
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
amount you have to decide whether that's
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
really fair or not right so hopefully we
 
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
can incentivize that with some of the
 
00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
one-time funds that we have and there I
 
00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
think there'll be some very good and
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
exciting opportunities uh in in a lot of
 
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:53.569 --> 00:36:53.579 align:start position:0%
um okay so this uh probably so this is
 
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
just another chart kind of showing
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
um the 3866 on the left and that's the
 
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
top bar goes to 4 700 1933 that's what
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
we do for free and reduce lunch today
 
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
that'll move to 2500 on on day one and
 
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
then again go up two percent every year
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
um we extreme increase the extraordinary
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
needs grants every year by 50 we start
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
with a big amount of about 80 million on
 
00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:17.339 align:start position:0%
on whole on a hold harmless provision
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
every two years it just ticks down uh 20
 
00:37:23.089 --> 00:37:23.099 align:start position:0%
so you have a 10-year slow rollout so it
 
00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
gives to towns plenty of time to make
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
any adjustments or unnecessary until we
 
00:37:28.849 --> 00:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
get back to a more normalized formula
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
and then the big piece on the bottom is
 
00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
that CPI adjustment which I think is so
 
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
critical I apologize for being
 
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
repetitive I just know there's a lot of
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
pieces here and I know I I talk fast my
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
dad will watch this online and he'll
 
00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
tell me you're talking too fast you
 
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
gotta slow down dummy I get that one
 
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
every day in a text
 
00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.950 align:start position:0%
every day in a text
um

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:47.579 align:start position:0%
and that's again I'm not going to repeat
 
00:37:50.089 --> 00:37:50.099 align:start position:0%
this as kind of uh the stuff that we
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
just talked about
 
00:37:53.089 --> 00:37:53.099 align:start position:0%
um oh so people always ask about charter
 
00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
schools and efas right so my budget does
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
propose uh it effectively doubles the
 
00:37:58.849 --> 00:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
amount of opportunity into education
 
00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts we thought a few
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
hundred families would take advantage
 
00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:04.140 align:start position:0%
thousands of families are taking an
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
advantage it's just it's so popular more
 
00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
people want in huge opportunity we're
 
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
doing it right
 
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
um and and so again that appropriation
 
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
gets uh substantial I think commissioner
 
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
adelbroot was the one that proposed
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
moving uh for certain subsets uh of
 
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
students maybe they they're within the
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
DD Community or their their folks are
 
00:38:26.329 --> 00:38:26.339 align:start position:0%
veterans or there's a whole subset of
 
00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
um exemptions if you will that
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner Ada put together and
 
00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
allowing them up to 500 percent of the
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
um these are students that are just in
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
extraordinary circumstances for one way
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
or another and kind of opening up the
 
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
the opportunity there I think is huge
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
but by moving these base amounts you're
 
00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:43.140 align:start position:0%
also increasing the amount you sent to
 
00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools too right and and
 
00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
that'll be great and I think I'm looking
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
at representative Moody she's she's
 
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:49.380 align:start position:0%
Moody she's got a great bill out there
 
00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
as well that'll also provide a lot a lot
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
of opportunity but there's Financial
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity there for all of this right
 
00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:56.780 align:start position:0%
the thing I like about this is everybody
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
no one's going to be thrilled but
 
00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:01.380 align:start position:0%
everybody gets a win everybody gets a
 
00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:02.270 align:start position:0%
everybody gets a win everybody gets a
win

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
win
 
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
um whether it's it's a dealing with the
 
00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
left side of the formula that a lot of
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
I'll just say a lot of Democrats have
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
come to me and asked to really challenge
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
ourselves on that side or the
 
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
simplifying the right side or making
 
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
sure Charter Schools or efas get get can
 
00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
can grow appropriately and be more
 
00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
equitably funded that's all there it's
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
all there or or
 
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
School building Aid where's Michael
 
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
did he leave Miss Cahill oh he left me
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
with the sheet Michael okay Hill calling
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
me and once a week asking me for a
 
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
school building Aid God bless him I gave
 
00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
my text number back in 2015. he doesn't
 
00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
let me forget it but he but it's good
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
and he and he he has some very good
 
00:39:38.329 --> 00:39:38.339 align:start position:0%
ideas and again having that 75 million
 
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
dollars is still being able to fulfill
 
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
what we've already obligated but also
 
00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
adding another 75 million in there is a
 
00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
huge opportunity so even Michael Cahill
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
might be happy about this which is
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
exciting okay
 
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
the last thing I'm going to go through
 
00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
and I know I'm going along I tend to be
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
kind of in in the weeds uh some of the
 
00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579 align:start position:0%
bigger some some folks are asking just
 
00:39:58.609 --> 00:39:58.619 align:start position:0%
about some of the bigger Capital
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
highlights now the capital one-time
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
money comes in both the Surplus which is
 
00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
historical hundreds of millions in the
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
Surplus as well as the 125 million in
 
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
the rainy day uh in the capital budget
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
itself so the capital budget the
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
traditional capital budget some of the
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
bigger items you see uh on the left
 
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
there and more the Surplus bigger items
 
00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
on the right so we have the liquor
 
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
stores that have to get rebuilt in
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
Hampton when you do that you're going to
 
00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
create so much more Revenue it's going
 
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
to be fantastic every time we rebuild
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
one of these stores we we end up making
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
lots more money and it's it's a
 
00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
no-brainer huge win uh when when we
 
00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:32.339 align:start position:0%
again sell the property and then uh can
 
00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
actually rebuild that store uh edu
 
00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
department of education's building as a
 
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
lot of you know was completely infested
 
00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
within in asbestos last year had to get
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
completely redone and we need to buy the
 
00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:44.220 align:start position:0%
new building the Rochester courthouse uh
 
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
there's a um if you've been in the
 
00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.170 align:start position:0%
there's a um if you've been in the
courthouse

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
courthouse
 
00:40:50.089 --> 00:40:50.099 align:start position:0%
you understand right
 
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
uh these are 8.5 million allocated to
 
00:40:53.569 --> 00:40:53.579 align:start position:0%
the National Guard
 
00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
um the Clean Water the clean drinking
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
water clean water and the drinking water
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
matches are both Federal matches that
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
allow us to pull down a lot of federal
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
funds on the left-hand side of that
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes we shortchange that but we
 
00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
just don't have to this year so
 
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
um you know that's money that's been
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
allocated to the state so I say we go
 
00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:11.579 align:start position:0%
get it on the Surplus side mmis that's
 
00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:13.740 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid management system very
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
expensive system this is the next phase
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
of it uh to over 20 million dollars it
 
00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
really has to get done to manage the 150
 
00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
000 plus 180 000 plus individuals within
 
00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid doj is going to have their new
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
building uh a few folks in this room are
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
going to have wonderful new parking
 
00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
spots uh that's in there at the 15
 
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
million dollar amount that we were given
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh that the 10 million for the new Men's
 
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
prison that's that initial 10 million to
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
at least over the next year or two to do
 
00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:41.579 align:start position:0%
the initial design invest in h in the
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
housing right so another 30 million into
 
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
invest in age 25 million into the New
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
those programs are just rolling out very
 
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
very well to actually put shovels in the
 
00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
ground build bricks and mortar get
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
actual more housing up so we want to
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
continue those programs the crypto
 
00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
interoperability lab it's only one and a
 
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:02.220 align:start position:0%
half million but that's a very new thing
 
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
if any of you were paying attention to
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
the crypto discussions digital assets
 
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
this really makes sure that we're
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
protecting ourselves in a variety of
 
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
different ways within the state and it
 
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
goes without if you've read the news at
 
00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:15.020 align:start position:0%
all about all the different
 
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
controversies surrounding crypto digital
 
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:20.220 align:start position:0%
assets blockchain there's huge
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity there but it does need a
 
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework and this crypto
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
interoperability lab it's very low money
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
for one and a half million to at least
 
00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:29.339 align:start position:0%
kind of put us at the Forefront very few
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
states have anything like this I don't
 
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
know if any do actually but it would
 
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
really put us at the Forefront in terms
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
of understanding the issues protecting
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
us uh making sure look there's no doubt
 
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
uh there are there there were Russian
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
entities trying to launder their money
 
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
through crypto here in the United States
 
00:42:46.849 --> 00:42:46.859 align:start position:0%
right so understanding how that system
 
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
works and making sure we're provide
 
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
providing the right guidelines so it's
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
not happening here year I think is very
 
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
very important and you know a fun little
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
project but it's amazing but it's
 
00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
important it's it's not a throwaway by
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
any means I am proposing eight million
 
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
dollars to UNH hockey and people say
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
what are you doing with UNH hockey look
 
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's a D1 team but they don't have a
 
00:43:08.329 --> 00:43:08.339 align:start position:0%
D1 facility we don't have a lot of that
 
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
stuff in in the state right we are not
 
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
known for our big sports but we do love
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
our hockey we have a great hockey team
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
we have an incredible program over there
 
00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:17.339 align:start position:0%
um but the place does need something
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
else so I've been meeting with folks
 
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
this is about 25 of the cost they're
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
going to raise a lot of it on the
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
private sector they're going to put some
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
money money in themselves and they've
 
00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579 align:start position:0%
asked the state to make an allocation
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
which I I think I think is very
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
important the new way that you know we
 
00:43:32.329 --> 00:43:32.339 align:start position:0%
want our we want the UNH system they're
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
making the right Investments they're
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
creating the right efficiencies and you
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
want to you need you need a brand right
 
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
when you look at what kids look at to
 
00:43:40.609 --> 00:43:40.619 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to not just go
 
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
play hockey at a university but the
 
00:43:44.329 --> 00:43:44.339 align:start position:0%
pride behind teams and all that sort of
 
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
thing it's really important and UNH
 
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
hockey has been phenomenal over the
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
years uh waning a little bit and it's
 
00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
hard to recruit new players and all of
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
that and the facility probably needs
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
some major upgrade in the near future
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
anyway so we have the money Now's the
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
Time so I threw it in there
 
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:01.140 align:start position:0%
um for all those who are like UNH hockey
 
00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
so that was super fast uh a lot but
 
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
super fast we can open up for questions
 
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
you can kick me right out of here
 
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
whatever you guys like but I think
 
00:44:11.089 --> 00:44:11.099 align:start position:0%
there's a huge opportunity here lots of
 
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
money to go around
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
um it's it's better than having to cut
 
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
ten percent right and some of you were
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
in those days uh those um those points
 
00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
back in the day but spending spending
 
00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
more money than you expected to have is
 
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
also a kind of a challenging
 
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:26.220 align:start position:0%
responsibility too making sure that you
 
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
kind of get that right and hopefully
 
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
okay all right good I didn't get too
 
00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
much wrong there so I'll turn it back
 
00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
over to you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for your presentation Governor
 
00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to say that within the
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
experience of this committee there's
 
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
over 100 years in performing our
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional duty to create the state
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
budget and I'm also happy to say that
 
00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget assistant
 
00:44:53.329 --> 00:44:53.339 align:start position:0%
has over 100 years experience also
 
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
collectively so I'm happy that you're
 
00:44:56.809 --> 00:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
ready to answer a few questions and
 
00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
first representative Edwards and then
 
00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire another questions
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and uh welcome
 
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
Governor uh I I want to start by
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
thanking you for signing the YDC Bill
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
yesterday that was tremendous
 
00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
coordination cooperation with the Senate
 
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
and the and you so so that's great uh
 
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
and in that theme I I have an
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
observation before my question and that
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
is uh with all the legislative
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
discussion in the last week or two I'm
 
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
concerned that as I look at your capital
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
and one-time money I don't see anything
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
for a YDC replacement and and I think
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a topic because it
 
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
feels like we're running the clock out
 
00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
on the ARP money and forcing it into
 
00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:47.339 align:start position:0%
General funds by delay and I I just want
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
to make sure that everyone is aware
 
00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
there's a bill there that absolutely so
 
00:45:53.809 --> 00:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that let me harp right on
 
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
can I can I get to my question oh I'm
 
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:56.589 align:start position:0%
can I can I get to my question oh I'm
sorry

00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:45:59.089 --> 00:45:59.099 align:start position:0%
that was that was the observation that
 
00:46:02.089 --> 00:46:02.099 align:start position:0%
was just the observation so so
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
um I have constituents who are going to
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
come to me and say this is a great
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
budget but I'm not seeing any Bill
 
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
payers or spending reductions I'm seeing
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
increases across the board and uh and
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
maybe we can afford that uh you think we
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
do but uh there's some concern that as
 
00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
we go ahead and fund the state at the
 
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
level that we want to fund the state
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
we're crowding out the possibility of
 
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
resources being used in the private
 
00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
sector so so there's there's kind of an
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
economic uh reason in shortages like we
 
00:46:40.849 --> 00:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
have to have less government and more
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
private sector it's a strategy and I'm
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
just curious to what extent you know
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
where you are on that part of the
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
strategy yeah well look I I we cut taxes
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
I got rid of it Tire tax you want to cut
 
00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
more taxes Lord knows I'm not going to
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
say no to that
 
00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
um the the fact is our economy is
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
incredibly strong right the dollars keep
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
coming in without a doubt so uh I I
 
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
you're talking to the number I'm very
 
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
proud I'm ranked the number one well I'm
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
now number two most fiscally responsible
 
00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
governor in the country Kim Reynolds
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
beat me out this year I used to be
 
00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
number one so no you're talking to
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal Hawk you want to cut cut the size
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
of government and streamline absolutely
 
00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
but our economy is really strong we're
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
not we're not asking for a single extra
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
dollar that is we're sending more back
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
to schools than every report we're kind
 
00:47:25.849 --> 00:47:25.859 align:start position:0%
of reallocating the right way so if you
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
want to cut more that that's okay I tell
 
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
me where to cut it though I mean there's
 
00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
there's just
 
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
I think we've done a great job in years
 
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
one and two not so much in three and
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
four but maybe in years five and six of
 
00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
this Administration have constantly
 
00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
cutting out the bureaucracy
 
00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
um the big the big reason we have a lot
 
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:46.140 align:start position:0%
a lot of flexibility and the big reason
 
00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
you have a surplus the prime one of the
 
00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
primary reasons is we don't have staff
 
00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:52.140 align:start position:0%
right there some of these lapses are so
 
00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
huge because we haven't had a lot of
 
00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
Staff that's not necessarily a very good
 
00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
way to to do things so I would just
 
00:47:59.210 --> 00:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
caution that some of the excess money
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
today isn't necessarily access tomorrow
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
right and if I kept assuming you know
 
00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
we're increasing revenues five six
 
00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
percent or fifteen percent like we've
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
had no I'm saying our revenues are going
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
down all right so but we've just managed
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
really really well
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
um and we've created much more efficient
 
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
systems and by that I mean
 
00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
you know we we try to put more of the
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
treatment and Recovery local not just in
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester or Concord we try to put more
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
of them more on the mental health
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
services local the emergency teams out
 
00:48:29.329 --> 00:48:29.339 align:start position:0%
there we don't want folks to have to
 
00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire hospital and again
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
that actually it costs a little more up
 
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
front which we did a few years ago but
 
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
the long-term efficiencies of the system
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
get much better you have less recidivism
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
into the systems and all all of those
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
sorts of things so um just I do want to
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
go back to YDC though right that's
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
really important so I did sign that bill
 
00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
yesterday I was also very frustrated
 
00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
that I only got that we only extended
 
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
the date that's fine you absolutely need
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
money in there I'm holding back enough
 
00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
arpa money arpa money is ready to go and
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
we would move it through tomorrow and
 
00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:00.900 align:start position:0%
that's what the the expectation was if
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature doesn't do it we can
 
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
still move the arpa money forward it
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have to come
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
directly out of the budget so I have a
 
00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:08.220 align:start position:0%
couple different pots we can pull from
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
on a moment's notice as do you uh to
 
00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:12.839 align:start position:0%
actually move that forward and that has
 
00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
to happen by the end of 24 you
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely need a new facility in this
 
00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
state some of those kids are are
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
dangerous to themselves they're
 
00:49:23.089 --> 00:49:23.099 align:start position:0%
dangerous to others we have a system now
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
that is not just lock them up we don't
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
do that anymore that's the awesome part
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
of this we have a system that really is
 
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
programmatic and creates Whole Health
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
services around those kids around those
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
individuals to get them back on track
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
but you don't just say we're kids that
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
are dangerous to themselves and others
 
00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
we're just going to send home that's
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
that's not that's dangerous it's
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
dangerous so I think most people
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
actually understand that and you you do
 
00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
have to move forward in in some way so
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
I'd hopefully I would hope that they
 
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
they both the legislature both authorize
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
the construction and then move forward
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's with the Opera money or
 
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
surplus funds here this budget still
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
allocates 180 million dollars to the
 
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund right about 90 or so at
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
the end of this year and another 80 or
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
90 or so at the end of 25. so there's a
 
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
lot a lot of flexibility to play with
 
00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:09.890 align:start position:0%
lot a lot of flexibility to play with
here

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
um even assuming revenues are coming
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
down so that's about as constraint as as
 
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
I think we could practically make it in
 
00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
the hopes that we were finally able to
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
bring our vacancy rate from 20 maybe
 
00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
down to 10 or 12 percent
 
00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah representative McGuire
 
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chairman
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you governor for coming there's a
 
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:30.900 align:start position:0%
lot of fantastic stuff here particularly
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
licensing and adequacy in my opinion
 
00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:35.339 align:start position:0%
um let me ask you about school building
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
Aid so the way that program has worked
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
in the past is every year there's
 
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
there's one two three four winners
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's about 12 losers and there's a
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
hundreds that don't even bother to apply
 
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
right because you know it's very chunky
 
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
is my point would it be better to
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps inadequacy have have a small
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
payment that's that's a capital payment
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's so much per year
 
00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:05.460 align:start position:0%
because every kid's going to need school
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
at some point that that would be a kind
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
of a capital pay down or something per
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
year rather than having a special
 
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
program that touches you and touches you
 
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
but not to everybody yeah so you know my
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
budget allocates the 75 million
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
um I gotta be honest however you you
 
00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
guys want to do it is is fine I mean you
 
00:51:26.329 --> 00:51:26.339 align:start position:0%
guys are the voice of the people you're
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
hearing what's happening out there I
 
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
will tell you I think similarly my
 
00:51:30.829 --> 00:51:30.839 align:start position:0%
feeling is
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
even though the existing structure of
 
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:35.220 align:start position:0%
school building Aid does I think split
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
it out into thirds or something like
 
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
that it looks at the size of schools it
 
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't the challenge with that is I
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
think that's great because I think small
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
schools are getting left behind this is
 
00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
going to be the end of my thesis is
 
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
small school small districts get left
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
behind they're allocated a certain
 
00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
portion of the money but a lot of these
 
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
districts don't have the teams at a
 
00:51:56.569 --> 00:51:56.579 align:start position:0%
Manchester or Dover or or Portsmouth or
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
Plymouth desert I'm just kind of picking
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
big towns that you know they have kind
 
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:01.140 align:start position:0%
of the teams and the experts they know
 
00:52:02.329 --> 00:52:02.339 align:start position:0%
how to go after the money they can get
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
the Architects on the line they can get
 
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
they can get it faster right
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
um so any process that allows smaller
 
00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:11.339 align:start position:0%
towns to have better access to these
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
Capital funds I I'm all for
 
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
um but I I got to be honest I'm going to
 
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
really defer to you guys how you want to
 
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
divide it up I'm just kind of saying
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
look we have at least 75 million to put
 
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
into school building Aid whether it's
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
just plowing it into the old formula or
 
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
coming up with a different way I'm a bit
 
00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
agnostic on it I would just hope and ask
 
00:52:30.049 --> 00:52:30.059 align:start position:0%
that you try to create a system that
 
00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
allows smaller town to have as big of a
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
bite of the apple as the the big guys
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
representative Heath for a question
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and Governor thank
 
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
you for putting support behind education
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
and I also want to thank you for your
 
00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
comments about Medicaid direct
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
certification I think that's a win-win
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
for our state and I'm certainly hoping
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
that this body will go along with that I
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
I just think it uh means a lot to so
 
00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:56.990 align:start position:0%
I just think it uh means a lot to so
many

00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
um couple of questions oh but one other
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
thing what about football at UNH uh I'm
 
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't know I went to a football
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
game but that Stadium looked pretty darn
 
00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
good to me I couldn't help it
 
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
um my to my real questions
 
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
um does the savings from phasing out
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
stabilization grants cover the proposed
 
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
increase in adequacy Aid and I think you
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
kind of touched on that and I'll just
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
keep going by other questions and in
 
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
terms of the um accountability
 
00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
requirements for the extraordinary needs
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
grants um are you going to continue that
 
00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
requirement and then finally how
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
confident are you that the education
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
trust fund can support the proposed
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
changes with the business business tax
 
00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:42.839 align:start position:0%
cuts that are in place and the interest
 
00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
in dividends phase out sure great all
 
00:53:46.849 --> 00:53:46.859 align:start position:0%
great questions so the quick answer is
 
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
in taking all the right side of the
 
00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
formula stuff
 
00:53:52.609 --> 00:53:52.619 align:start position:0%
um a good portion is still kept into the
 
00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
whole harmless and extraordinary needs
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
Provisions that we remain on the right
 
00:53:57.530 --> 00:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
side and a good portion goes back to the
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
left side of the formula to to more
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
adequately account for for you know
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
existing students as opposed to students
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
of 2006.
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's all very financially it all
 
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
works out fiscally it all absolutely
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
works out we've run this out 10 to 20
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
years and there's still plenty of money
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
in the trust fund and as I said even if
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
you made a big switch like doing the the
 
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch for every
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
automatic enrollment of every Medicaid
 
00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
kid 30 million dollars we can handle
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
that too I didn't put it in my budget
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's kind of I think there's a bill
 
00:54:27.049 --> 00:54:27.059 align:start position:0%
out there to do that but that initiative
 
00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
it will before to pass nothing nothing
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
could change and we're still financially
 
00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
stable uh there's another question there
 
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
sorry uh the taxes
 
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh yeah that our tax base is very
 
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
healthy yeah I mean I assume revenues go
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
down and this all still works
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
um you know because the way that you the
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
legislature in the past has set up a
 
00:54:47.569 --> 00:54:47.579 align:start position:0%
certain dedicated portion going to the
 
00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:50.700 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's still it's still there so
 
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
it it all plays out based on the the
 
00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
revenues not just for next year but for
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
the next 10 or more goes out beyond that
 
00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.730 align:start position:0%
the next 10 or more goes out beyond that
yeah

00:54:58.730 --> 00:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative papovichi Miller for a
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
you governor for taking the questions
 
00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
um frankly this is the one committee
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
where it's totally safe to get into the
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
weeds yeah yeah the finance committee
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
um one particular uh area that wasn't
 
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
covered in the highlights is
 
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
um you know our unfunded liability for
 
00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:19.859 align:start position:0%
the retirement system I just wanted to
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
hear your thoughts on
 
00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
how you know you would see us handling
 
00:55:26.809 --> 00:55:26.819 align:start position:0%
and catching up on that issue great
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
question so uh as you as many as you all
 
00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:31.140 align:start position:0%
know I think significant changes were
 
00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
made to the system back in around 2011.
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
it's a roughly a 30-year plan if you
 
00:55:37.849 --> 00:55:37.859 align:start position:0%
will that was designed to close the the
 
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
extreme uh liability uh there's a lot of
 
00:55:41.809 --> 00:55:41.819 align:start position:0%
variables that go into that
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
um there is flexibility here yeah a lot
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
of folks have said look let's just take
 
00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
some of the Surplus and dump it into the
 
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
Corpus and if you wanted to do that you
 
00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
could we have a lot of surplus we have a
 
00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:52.740 align:start position:0%
you know it's part of that rainy day
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
trust fund if you say we want to take 50
 
00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:55.740 align:start position:0%
million even 100 million I'm not
 
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily recommending that but I
 
00:55:58.849 --> 00:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
would leave that to you huge opportunity
 
00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
to just eat down on that Corpus we made
 
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
huge changes to the retirement not huge
 
00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
but very significant changes to the
 
00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
retirement system both in terms of the
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
cost of living adjustment we made a few
 
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
years ago what we did last year with a
 
00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:12.900 align:start position:0%
few pieces I think there's some bills
 
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
before you that they're really
 
00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
aggressive I think they're like 50 to
 
00:56:18.049 --> 00:56:18.059 align:start position:0%
100 million dollar bills to basically
 
00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
undo everything that was done back in
 
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
2011. I don't necessarily think that's a
 
00:56:23.809 --> 00:56:23.819 align:start position:0%
good good idea but this liability is
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
very real you bring up an incredibly
 
00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
good point we I kept a lot of
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
flexibility in there in case you wanted
 
00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
to on the on the one-time money side if
 
00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
you want to eat down on that Corpus yeah
 
00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you for being here Governor
 
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
um I know that you mentioned that
 
00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a three percent rate
 
00:56:53.089 --> 00:56:53.099 align:start position:0%
increase for the Medicaid providers is
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
that across the board and I mean I I
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
know you I all of us have been hearing
 
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
from the Medicaid providers that
 
00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:03.230 align:start position:0%
from the Medicaid providers that
um

00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
there some some of them feel that their
 
00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
need is much greater than the three
 
00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
percent and have you uh given any
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
thought to that yeah so let me you know
 
00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
when I went off when we did significant
 
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
rate increases a few years ago I thought
 
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
that across the board approach was a bad
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
idea I actually still think it's not
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
great but I know that that's probably
 
00:57:23.089 --> 00:57:23.099 align:start position:0%
where the legislature wants to go there
 
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
are Medicaid providers
 
00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
that need 12 increases there are
 
00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:29.339 align:start position:0%
Medicaid providers that are four or five
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
percent over Market
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
I mean why why would we give them an
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
increase so I tried to ask the
 
00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:36.780 align:start position:0%
legislature a few years ago to look at
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
it Case by case uh discipline by
 
00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
discipline to really make sure we're
 
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
giving more to those that needed more
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
and less to those that needed less right
 
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
when you compare it to Market and to
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
what the workforce demand needs are I
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
did the 3.1 percent across the board as
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
because well I don't think it's the best
 
00:57:53.089 --> 00:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
idea I thought it was the most palatable
 
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
to the legislature but if you want to go
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
more specific I am all with that because
 
00:57:58.730 --> 00:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
there are providers that need more than
 
00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
three percent I am the first to
 
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that I just put it in there
 
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
because it sounded like that's where the
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
legislature was going and I was more
 
00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
than anything trying to keep it
 
00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
simplistic as an aspect of the budget
 
00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you there are providers
 
00:58:11.329 --> 00:58:11.339 align:start position:0%
that get a little too much and providers
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
get get way too little
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
yeah but I know that's hard nobody when
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
we tried to do it last time well I don't
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
want to give them six percent in him
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
only two percent but I and my argument
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
was but he only needs six percent and he
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
only needs two percent like he needs six
 
00:58:28.609 --> 00:58:28.619 align:start position:0%
and he needs to do I allocate the money
 
00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
to actually where the need is the most
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
and um there was it wasn't a very big
 
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
appetite for that before but if you want
 
00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
to go back to that I'm I'm all I'm all
 
00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:38.210 align:start position:0%
to go back to that I'm I'm all I'm all
ears

00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:38.220 align:start position:0%
ears
 
00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
I have a couple questions
 
00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:42.230 align:start position:0%
I have a couple questions
um

00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
I remember what we went through with the
 
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
women's prison it took almost two years
 
00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
to figure out where it was going to go
 
00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:49.559 align:start position:0%
we started one then we went to another
 
00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
and I think we went to a third before we
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
finally we went back to our ninja one so
 
00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
the Men's prison have we got any idea
 
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
where we're going to put it is it going
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
to be in a different place yeah so if I
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
may commissioner Hanks kind of did a
 
00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
preliminary review of options and I
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
think she has some good ideas the
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
initial 10 million I'm putting for it is
 
00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
to your exact point it takes a year or a
 
00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
couple years to really figure it out and
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
then I have 40 million also allocated on
 
00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
the back end in the second year the
 
00:59:17.809 --> 00:59:17.819 align:start position:0%
budget to go to put a shovel in the
 
00:59:19.609 --> 00:59:19.619 align:start position:0%
ground to at least put that marker in
 
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
because if you do the study and it just
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
and even if you figure out exactly where
 
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
it's going to go and how big it needs to
 
00:59:26.569 --> 00:59:26.579 align:start position:0%
be but you have no you can't start
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
construction at all you just never know
 
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:30.900 align:start position:0%
when the next legislature or church will
 
00:59:33.049 --> 00:59:33.059 align:start position:0%
finally get around to it so I put that
 
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
40 million in there to do exactly what
 
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
you you're asking deal with the next
 
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
couple years of placement I I think
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
there's I have heard there's a lot of
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
possibility to keep it right on the same
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
location which is a huge opportunity but
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
then you have to look at the size and
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
the new technologies that would come to
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
play look at that well you know what the
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
census is where we think it's going to
 
00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:53.460 align:start position:0%
go and all that but we have folks online
 
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
ready to go if we can allocate some of
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
the money to do that and commissioner
 
00:59:58.370 --> 00:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
Hanks I think can give a lot more
 
00:59:59.870 --> 00:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
perspective she did like a two-page
 
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
summary for me about options and that's
 
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
where I really got this she said look
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
this is not 150 200 million dollar
 
01:00:07.609 --> 01:00:07.619 align:start position:0%
project anymore given inflationary cost
 
01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:10.140 align:start position:0%
you're at at least 350 if not more
 
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
depending on on the size and scope of
 
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:13.140 align:start position:0%
this stuff now I think it should still
 
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
be run by the state and all that sort of
 
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
thing we're not trying to privatize
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
prisons no no we're just trying to do
 
01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
exactly what what I think you understand
 
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
is the time let's get let's get the ball
 
01:00:23.809 --> 01:00:23.819 align:start position:0%
rolling and then once we figure out what
 
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
we want to do let's put a shovel in the
 
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
ground and it kind of commits us to
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
doing to moving forward I think in the
 
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
right way
 
01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you a comment on inflation what
 
01:00:34.609 --> 01:00:34.619 align:start position:0%
we've done in the past because we don't
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
we look at the previous inflation to
 
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
judge what we're going to project what
 
01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:40.859 align:start position:0%
we've done in the past is look at the
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
two years previous inflation and project
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
that for the next two years
 
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
if we try to
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
do the second year we have no idea right
 
01:00:52.609 --> 01:00:52.619 align:start position:0%
there's not much you can go by you know
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
what you did for last year and the year
 
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
before you know what you'll hope forget
 
01:00:58.490 --> 01:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
next year but two years out
 
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
too much guesswork I think that's no I I
 
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
completely agree um I I would I mean I I
 
01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
propose it again I'm trying to keep
 
01:01:08.809 --> 01:01:08.819 align:start position:0%
everything simple I propose my CPI at a
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
fixed two percent I just fixed it I mean
 
01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
that way you're not guessing it just is
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
kind of built in some years you'll
 
01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
you'll guess better some years you'll be
 
01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
a little more on one side and some years
 
01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
you'll be a little different but again
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
you can play with that number
 
01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
um but I would just say that's one of
 
01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:24.839 align:start position:0%
the reasons why the Delta keeps getting
 
01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:26.339 align:start position:0%
bigger because we're only technically
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
you do an average of course but you only
 
01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
allocate it every other year even though
 
01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
inflation is a cumulative uh a number so
 
01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
um however you want to deal with it I'm
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
wide open I I'm just trying to kind of
 
01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
hopefully set the marker that if you if
 
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
you get something into
 
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
built in that it's being accounted for
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
every year the Delta doesn't grow and
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
it's not such a battle now again you
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
guys are gonna have spreadsheet Wars
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
there's towns that are going to see not
 
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
in the next couple years no Town loses
 
01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
anything in my formula in the next few
 
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
years but it may be around year four or
 
01:01:56.569 --> 01:01:56.579 align:start position:0%
even six or maybe way out in ten yeah
 
01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
they might start having to adjust
 
01:01:59.930 --> 01:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
because they just don't have the kids in
 
01:02:02.089 --> 01:02:02.099 align:start position:0%
their schools like like they used to
 
01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
um but um but again it gives time for
 
01:02:06.829 --> 01:02:06.839 align:start position:0%
that that to that to roll out
 
01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
and another thing that I look at is the
 
01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
education trust fund Surplus that's
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
money we can't use anywhere else yeah
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
and if this current budget gets tight
 
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
we're not going to want to have a
 
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
surplus in the trust fund that we can't
 
01:02:23.089 --> 01:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
use where else where we need it so we're
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
going to try to do something to address
 
01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:26.339 align:start position:0%
the Surplus
 
01:02:28.609 --> 01:02:28.619 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham and then
 
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
represent a leishman uh thank you for
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
coming it's nice to see you in terms of
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
targeting the increase where the benefit
 
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
would be the most in the Medicaid and
 
01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
certainly sounds like a great idea uh
 
01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
figuring out is something else can you
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
comment though 3.1 percent is a very
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
specific number and you know I had the
 
01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
same question how did you why is it not
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
because that's what the legislature was
 
01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
proposing I I literally was asking the
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
team why 3-1 I I can't tell you where
 
01:02:58.970 --> 01:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
that number came from I apologize I'm
 
01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
kind of going on with the what the I
 
01:03:01.849 --> 01:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
think what they're proposing in the
 
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
legislature so I just tried to
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
incorporate that
 
01:03:04.559 --> 01:03:05.450 align:start position:0%
incorporate that
um

01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know I I don't know where
 
01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
exactly they got that number
 
01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:11.339 align:start position:0%
could have been 4.6 for all I know but
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
it they I know the legislation that I
 
01:03:15.049 --> 01:03:15.059 align:start position:0%
was reading said three one so I just
 
01:03:17.569 --> 01:03:17.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes you just play the hand you're
 
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
Delta I guess but but I'm open for any
 
01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:21.829 align:start position:0%
Delta I guess but but I'm open for any
flexibility

01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
it sounds like Pi 3.14 yeah wait and
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
maybe it is maybe it just never that's
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
their way of never-ending it the dollars
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
never stop coming in representative
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
leishman for a question
 
01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh good
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
morning morning so how comfortable you
 
01:03:38.089 --> 01:03:38.099 align:start position:0%
are are you with your Revenue
 
01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
projections I think my quick
 
01:03:42.609 --> 01:03:42.619 align:start position:0%
calculations show your budget's up about
 
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
1.4 billion over this last
 
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:48.839 align:start position:0%
term so how comfortable you are I'm
 
01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:51.900 align:start position:0%
rejecting Revenue to go down so yeah I
 
01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
mean what we do is my number comes from
 
01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
the dra so the draug will give me a low
 
01:03:59.329 --> 01:03:59.339 align:start position:0%
medium high Revenue projection not just
 
01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
based on historical but based on all the
 
01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
other macro economic factors that we
 
01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
look at in each of the revenue
 
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
disciplines right business taxes low
 
01:04:08.569 --> 01:04:08.579 align:start position:0%
medium high we think it's going to go
 
01:04:08.579 --> 01:04:09.530 align:start position:0%
medium high we think it's going to go
here

01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
um tobacco tax we think it's going to go
 
01:04:12.289 --> 01:04:12.299 align:start position:0%
there Lottery we think it's going to go
 
01:04:12.299 --> 01:04:13.190 align:start position:0%
there Lottery we think it's going to go
there

01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
and then I kind of take uh traditionally
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
I kind of just take the mid-range
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
um it always I got to tell you I think
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
Lindsey stepp and her team are great
 
01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
because we always end up way under
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
it always I never not don't have a
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
surplus so I feel very confident about
 
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
those numbers uh going forward at least
 
01:04:31.490 --> 01:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
for the next couple years yeah without a
 
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
doubt I mean if they went if our
 
01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
revenues drop substantially below a half
 
01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
a percent
 
01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
um they I don't think they're going to
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
in the next couple years if they did
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
beyond that well now you're talking like
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
a real severe recession that's you know
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
in some level which I think we're gonna
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
have a stagnation I don't know if we're
 
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
gonna have a booming recession the other
 
01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
thing I will lean on a little bit if you
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
haven't met him
 
01:04:54.119 --> 01:04:55.370 align:start position:0%
haven't met him
um

01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
my good friend so and so over at um
 
01:04:59.450 --> 01:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
Unemployment Security who always does
 
01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
the macroeconomic stuff who am I
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
thinking of golly Brian Gollum uh over
 
01:05:06.289 --> 01:05:06.299 align:start position:0%
employment sorry Brian if you're
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
listening if you're in the room I
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
apologize Brian is fantastic he looks at
 
01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
I have Brian look at stuff uh really
 
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
from a big picture level I mean he will
 
01:05:16.609 --> 01:05:16.619 align:start position:0%
look at I'm just going to throw my two
 
01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
cents into to the work that's being done
 
01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
over there he'll look at
 
01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
how many reservations are being made at
 
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
open on opentable.com to because that is
 
01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:27.059 align:start position:0%
a great sign of upper end discretionary
 
01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
income spending he'll look at the season
 
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
passes sometimes on a ski resort because
 
01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
that looks at the upper and he'll look
 
01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
at the discretionary spending of
 
01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
different of different regions and
 
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
different uh socioeconomics
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
placements of demographics to really
 
01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
figure out where we're going
 
01:05:44.809 --> 01:05:44.819 align:start position:0%
um he does about a half hour
 
01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
presentation if you're interested that I
 
01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
think it just will knock your socks off
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
he updates the data every month but
 
01:05:53.569 --> 01:05:53.579 align:start position:0%
combined with his uh Outlook taking a
 
01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
look at where the revenues where we
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
think the revenues are going to go where
 
01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
the changes in the tax structure that we
 
01:05:59.930 --> 01:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
made a few years ago
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
being more of a sales factor a tax
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
structure I really and and we have taken
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
like a hundred thousand taxpayers off
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
the rolls right we used to have this we
 
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
kind of have a de minimis now we changed
 
01:06:12.349 --> 01:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
the de minimis for paying your state
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
taxes uh in terms of business and
 
01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
profits tax that has simplified
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
everything by the way the majority of
 
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:19.980 align:start position:0%
taxes are paid by the big guys there's
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
no doubt about that I want to say the 50
 
01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
top I'm going to get this data point
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
wrong so I beg people not to completely
 
01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
quote me but something like the 50 top
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in the state pay well over 50
 
01:06:33.049 --> 01:06:33.059 align:start position:0%
of the state's tax right because these
 
01:06:34.849 --> 01:06:34.859 align:start position:0%
are the big corporate taxpayers they pay
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
their more than you know that that share
 
01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
it's huge and there's the diff the
 
01:06:41.809 --> 01:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
change in dynamics of of businesses you
 
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
know how we buy products we buy more on
 
01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
Amazon so the Amazons are paying them
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
all we're buying more on you know with
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
these kind of bigger companies not that
 
01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:50.099 align:start position:0%
we don't want to keep promoting small
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
businesses but that reality I think uh
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
plays into a more uh a better
 
01:06:57.289 --> 01:06:57.299 align:start position:0%
understanding of where where the these
 
01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
individual tax brackets will move is
 
01:07:01.609 --> 01:07:01.619 align:start position:0%
that a James that a safe way of saying
 
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
that you think okay there you go so I
 
01:07:04.609 --> 01:07:04.619 align:start position:0%
feel confident I feel very confident
 
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
about it I've always I've always gone it
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
I've always been a little off to the low
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
which is a good thing
 
01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and thank you Mr
 
01:07:14.809 --> 01:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
chairman all right representative
 
01:07:16.849 --> 01:07:16.859 align:start position:0%
McGuire for a quick a question followed
 
01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
by representative Edwards thank you Mr
 
01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
chair thank you again
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
um let me follow up on representative
 
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
leishman's question by turning to page
 
01:07:32.329 --> 01:07:32.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.609 --> 01:07:34.619 align:start position:0%
I love that you read this I'm very
 
01:07:36.289 --> 01:07:36.299 align:start position:0%
excited no it's very good and and your
 
01:07:38.089 --> 01:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
presentation by the way excellent I hope
 
01:07:41.569 --> 01:07:41.579 align:start position:0%
we get a copy online so I can share with
 
01:07:45.069 --> 01:07:45.079 align:start position:0%
constituents and so on yeah
 
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
so page 16 you see this is source of
 
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
funds and notice that federal funds jump
 
01:07:56.089 --> 01:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
significantly as do other funds so I
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
thought this past biennium federal funds
 
01:08:02.329 --> 01:08:02.339 align:start position:0%
were really way up but we're expecting
 
01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
this next biennium to be even more is
 
01:08:08.089 --> 01:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
that true is it where's that coming from
 
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
uh yes that's that's that is true that
 
01:08:13.609 --> 01:08:13.619 align:start position:0%
is uh the agency's uh and departments
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
projections as the federal revenue that
 
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
they are going to be getting uh a lot of
 
01:08:20.809 --> 01:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
it's coming uh well a lot of it's coming
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
through HHS that's the main driver of
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
all of our federal funds and but then
 
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
other departments such as uh safety and
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh are also expecting
 
01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
large uh Federal Infuse of money as well
 
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
if I may yeah arpa is done and all that
 
01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
like we have a little bit of money to
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
spend but remember when they reallocated
 
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
some of these other bills like
 
01:08:44.809 --> 01:08:44.819 align:start position:0%
transportation is a great example still
 
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
massive I mean they really allocated a
 
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
mass amount of money not for this year
 
01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
but for the next two or three years most
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
of it will get spent through 26 some
 
01:08:54.169 --> 01:08:54.179 align:start position:0%
even through 28. so the allocations you
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
saw that they've already done that's
 
01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
really what it's based on it's it's a
 
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
lot more for everybody Washington yeah
 
01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
they still have a bit of a spelling
 
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
problem but we'll take advantage when
 
01:09:05.209 --> 01:09:05.219 align:start position:0%
they do and how about the other funds
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
category there's also another looks like
 
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
300 million per year or something going
 
01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:13.570 align:start position:0%
300 million per year or something going
on

01:09:13.570 --> 01:09:13.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
yep so you're looking at the the it's
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
going from about 1.3 million uh 1.5 this
 
01:09:21.169 --> 01:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
year and all the way up to 1.6 uh for
 
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
the next couple years right
 
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
right that's just that's just a variety
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
of other uh various revenues as the
 
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
state collects I mean licenses fees
 
01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
hunting licenses all of that just a
 
01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
variety of things yeah that's more
 
01:09:36.769 --> 01:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
efficient game but uh there's just a
 
01:09:38.329 --> 01:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
variety of things and when you look at
 
01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
it the uh what's happening is inflation
 
01:09:45.169 --> 01:09:45.179 align:start position:0%
is these barely keep up with inflation
 
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
so other numbers look like dramatic
 
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
increases when you take a uh inflation
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
of seven percent and eight percent
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
annually they're really not that's it
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for a question uh
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
another question I'm kind of still on
 
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
messaging Governor uh I I I have to
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
explain this to my constituents and and
 
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
so the part that's easy to sell to to at
 
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
least to my district is
 
01:10:17.209 --> 01:10:17.219 align:start position:0%
um uh your commitment to no new taxes no
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
new fees that's excellent so as I'm
 
01:10:23.090 --> 01:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
looking at the the budget uh your budget
 
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
to us there's there's an exception in
 
01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
there that I may need some help on and
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's a brand new agency the
 
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board uh
 
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
it is going to be introducing new
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
regulation and it's going to introduce a
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
new fee and uh it it appears to be
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
redundant with a lot of things that the
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
department of insurance and others
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
already do so it's going to be a special
 
01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
topic that division three looks at but I
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
just want to make you aware I'm trying
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
to help you keep your promise no new tax
 
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
no new fees the pdab violates that yeah
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
I did not create that that was created
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
by the by the legislature like that so
 
01:11:08.689 --> 01:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
we're just that's was created so we have
 
01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
to we have to adhere to it I mean if you
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
want to undo it or change it that's
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely your prerogative and
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm going to need some help
 
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
is undoing it okay well I can yeah I'll
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
take a look at it
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
but I just want people to understand
 
01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
that's not like something I added into
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
my budget because I you know I didn't
 
01:11:25.370 --> 01:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
think of that one in the shower one day
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
no and I understand it's very
 
01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
controversial in a challenge so I'm with
 
01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:31.070 align:start position:0%
controversial in a challenge so I'm with
you

01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
present a Mooney for a question thank
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you Governor thank
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
you both for being here your ability to
 
01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
pinpoint all the hot button issues in
 
01:11:41.450 --> 01:11:41.460 align:start position:0%
the state is spot on in this budget so I
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for that just a quick word on
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
water uh you have a line in there about
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
Wastewater state aid and is there
 
01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
anything else you want to add about our
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
water issues Statewide thank you
 
01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
Governor well yeah I just I mean uh so a
 
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
lot of different opportunities I think
 
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
the state has done a phenomenal job in
 
01:11:59.450 --> 01:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
the past six years on really addressing
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
clean drinking water uh we made sure
 
01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
that our problems don't become crises
 
01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
and that there's a lot of different
 
01:12:07.130 --> 01:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
funds there's a state revolving fund for
 
01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
clean drinking water this one for for
 
01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
Wastewater those have been in existence
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
for a while by funding those we get a
 
01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
lot of match Federal opportunity we
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
still have uh Senator Morse who is not
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
with us uh well I don't say not put this
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
anymore he's he's down doing he's out on
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
the farm he's fine but um but you know
 
01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
he really did a phenomenal job
 
01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
um as did the folks at DES in terms of
 
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
the clean drinking water fund that was
 
01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
created out of the the settlement fund
 
01:12:33.050 --> 01:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
months those go on for quite a while
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
there's a huge queue of projects they're
 
01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
all being addressed Bob Scott has done I
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
think a very in his team have done a
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
very good job staying right on top of
 
01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:41.450 align:start position:0%
very good job staying right on top of
that

01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
um I mean then you get to I'm just just
 
01:12:44.689 --> 01:12:44.699 align:start position:0%
so we don't forget we get to everything
 
01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
from dams you know you get to all the
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
other water issues and resources and and
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
flood control and all those sort of
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
things which I know it's not clean
 
01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
drinking water driven but actually can
 
01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
impact clean drinking water issues uh if
 
01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
they're not if they're not handled
 
01:12:58.669 --> 01:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
properly so a lot of different funding
 
01:12:58.679 --> 01:12:59.689 align:start position:0%
properly so a lot of different funding
sources

01:12:59.689 --> 01:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
sources
 
01:13:02.689 --> 01:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
um uh yeah I just think uh just we got
 
01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
to stay right on top of it right and
 
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
it's not just a Southern Tier I'll give
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
Des a lot of credit they made sure that
 
01:13:09.649 --> 01:13:09.659 align:start position:0%
you know Whitefield had a project moving
 
01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
Conway has a project I think Conway is a
 
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
project yeah those pipes have got one in
 
01:13:15.169 --> 01:13:15.179 align:start position:0%
the ground about a year ago and it's
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
really about getting pipes in the ground
 
01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of these towns have done a
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
lot of studies we're also updating
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
helping them update their engineering we
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
pay for a lot of the engineering
 
01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
specifically for small towns and I
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
encourage all these small towns to take
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
a look the pfast issue is very real it
 
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
has to be addressed you know we have our
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
our standards EPA is trying to push
 
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
everybody even way below our standards
 
01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
which is is problematic and we'll see
 
01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
where all that pans out federally but we
 
01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
have very smart standards on clean
 
01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
drinking water we're building and
 
01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
designing to them I'll throw this in one
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
of the real challenges if I may with
 
01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
clean drinking water which a lot of you
 
01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
may know and not know
 
01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
is that you can say hey we have all this
 
01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
money we're just going to put in pipes
 
01:13:57.050 --> 01:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
to uh Town X but Town X might not want
 
01:13:59.330 --> 01:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
pipes people might say look I want my
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
clean I have a well I want my well
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to you contaminated my well
 
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
now you got to clean it up so a lot of
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
citizens don't necessarily want to go on
 
01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
Town water because then they get a bill
 
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
every month into perpetuity and I
 
01:14:12.410 --> 01:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
totally understand that
 
01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
um that's one of the local challenges
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
that some folks are having and why some
 
01:14:17.689 --> 01:14:17.699 align:start position:0%
of these projects they don't die but
 
01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
they really slow down Londonderry is a
 
01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
good example they had a couple good
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
projects on one side of town there are a
 
01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
couple neighborhoods that really pushed
 
01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
back and didn't want the clean drinking
 
01:14:27.290 --> 01:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
water even though it was really needed
 
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
so we're continuing to provide bottles
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is so
 
01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
um those local Town Dynamics can be
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
challenging Des eventually Works them
 
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
all out but that's one of the reasons
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
why sometimes I'll get a call from a
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative well this project isn't
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
moving forward it's like yeah your town
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't approve it you know because
 
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of pushback from the
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
neighborhood so you got to go work with
 
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
those neighbors and listen to them and
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
try to find a viable solution it's way
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
more expensive to try to give people you
 
01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
know clean clean water at the tap as
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to just a giant Town Source Town
 
01:14:59.930 --> 01:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
sources are the best way to give to give
 
01:15:01.610 --> 01:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
clean drinking water but not always the
 
01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
most preferred way and and you have to
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
be you have to understand that a lot of
 
01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
folks want their own in-house systems
 
01:15:09.169 --> 01:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
well those come with cost too because
 
01:15:10.669 --> 01:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
now you need to replace the filters or
 
01:15:12.169 --> 01:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
the cartridges or the Salter or the
 
01:15:13.490 --> 01:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
softeners or whatever it is you guys
 
01:15:15.649 --> 01:15:15.659 align:start position:0%
know how that can all go and to do that
 
01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
for a thousand different households
 
01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
every month isn't really practical right
 
01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:22.140 align:start position:0%
into perpetuity so um yeah there's a lot
 
01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
of opportunity there I I would just say
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
keep tapping into each each of these
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
individual funds whether it's the
 
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
settlement funds the local funds or the
 
01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
federal funds that we get matched out of
 
01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:31.850 align:start position:0%
federal funds that we get matched out of
that

01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
great excuse me I just want to clarify
 
01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
an answer I gave you a few uh
 
01:15:37.970 --> 01:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire on that on those
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
other funds and it'd be funny that I
 
01:15:41.689 --> 01:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
didn't remember it
 
01:15:43.970 --> 01:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
um we are receiving a lot more interest
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
on our on our savings and uh as our as
 
01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
our uh surpluses rise and with all the
 
01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
money we have from arpa that is uh while
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
it's committed it hasn't been spent
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
we're earning interest on that so and
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
that sort of uh included in those
 
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
numbers the extra interest that we're
 
01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
going to get on that knowing the amount
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
of money but also interest rates have
 
01:16:09.649 --> 01:16:09.659 align:start position:0%
risen so it's a combination of more
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
money higher interest rates and that's
 
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
in there as well so I'll tell you the
 
01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
funny story there if I can have 30
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
seconds so that has never happened
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
before we always have like rounding
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
errors of interest and literally at the
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
very end of the budget process after we
 
01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
had actually you know really allocated
 
01:16:24.649 --> 01:16:24.659 align:start position:0%
all the dollars we were talking to the
 
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
treasury and she said we didn't realize
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
this was going to happen but there's
 
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
like tens and tens of millions of
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
dollars of Interest we just I think put
 
01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
it into the rain day fund on the back
 
01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
end or something like this because so
 
01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
there's that's where a lot of the
 
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
cushion actually uh came from but yeah
 
01:16:40.490 --> 01:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
that's that's a big opportunity uh On
 
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
Any Given what day what it's February on
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
every on any given day over the past
 
01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
year and a half we currently hold about
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
a billion dollars 1.1 billion more in
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
cash than we ever have before
 
01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
um and part of that's arpa is just
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
strong economy it's a whole variety of
 
01:16:58.850 --> 01:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
things that create that so if you looked
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
at our cash flow year over year it's
 
01:17:01.729 --> 01:17:01.739 align:start position:0%
always cyclical it goes down at certain
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
times a year and up and then you look at
 
01:17:04.490 --> 01:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
this year and it's literally a billion
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
plus we usually have about let's say on
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
average one and a half one to one and a
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
half billion but now on average we have
 
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
about two and a half billion sitting
 
01:17:12.649 --> 01:17:12.659 align:start position:0%
there so it was just an inordinate
 
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
um and cash flow that we had never and
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
never known to have before so there you
 
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:20.940 align:start position:0%
go there's the other there's 60 million
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
in other funds right there over the
 
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
biennium representative Heath for a
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you and thank you
 
01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
governor for taking my question my
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
question is um with regard to the efas
 
01:17:35.209 --> 01:17:35.219 align:start position:0%
and I see that um you're increasing them
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
significantly as well as the eligibility
 
01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
um that's a lot of tax dollars
 
01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:44.450 align:start position:0%
um that's a lot of tax dollars
um

01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:47.209 --> 01:17:47.219 align:start position:0%
my concern I you know I used to work at
 
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
the department of Ed and I know the
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
department of Ed does a fabulous job
 
01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:52.669 align:start position:0%
department of Ed does a fabulous job
overseeing

01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
overseeing
 
01:17:56.209 --> 01:17:56.219 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars being dispersed
 
01:17:58.669 --> 01:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
um I would feel so much more comfortable
 
01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
if those dollars were being overseen by
 
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
the department of Ed I just I struggle
 
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
with this much money
 
01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
um going out through another agency
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
um that we don't have control over
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
knowing that the state does such a
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
powerful job getting funds out with
 
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
great accountability I know that you
 
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
have few citations in Audits and I would
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
feel so much more comfortable with it
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
staying with our state government thank
 
01:18:34.729 --> 01:18:34.739 align:start position:0%
you for taking well I'll say this last
 
01:18:36.410 --> 01:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
year we spent about a billion dollars in
 
01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:37.729 align:start position:0%
year we spent about a billion dollars in
education

01:18:37.729 --> 01:18:37.739 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
14 million went to efa's
 
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's not
 
01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.390 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's not
insignificant

01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
insignificant
 
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
it's 14 million out of a billion so it's
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
still an incredibly incredibly small
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
piece of the puzzle and I get it you
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
want to you know we we want to make sure
 
01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
but the system does have some checks and
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
balances in place and all that sort of
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
thing and it's incredibly popular people
 
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
want it and it's tax dollars but it's
 
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
their tax dollars so and I'll let you
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
guys I don't get too much into the
 
01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
politics of it but um it has proven to
 
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
be very very popular if you want to put
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
you know more oversight with with
 
01:19:10.729 --> 01:19:10.739 align:start position:0%
Department of Education on the program
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
that would might be a possibility right
 
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
and how that comes out I'm all for that
 
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
I don't mind that yeah
 
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
sure representative Petrie for a
 
01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:21.290 align:start position:0%
sure representative Petrie for a
question

01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
01:19:24.770 --> 01:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
governor for being here I think it's a
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
great budget
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
Stratford County Nursing Home
 
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
I didn't see any funds for that uh go
 
01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
for money R per money uh yeah we give
 
01:19:36.649 --> 01:19:36.659 align:start position:0%
them 20 million dollars I'm sorry
 
01:19:39.169 --> 01:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
Stratford Stratford County County yeah
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
so they uh so the next round of funding
 
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
sorry I I apologize I was thinking
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
Sullivan the next round of funding uh
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
out of the out of that arpa driven fund
 
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
from gopher
 
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I have that makes it
 
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
soon right
 
01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
it's very very soon and that's where the
 
01:19:59.810 --> 01:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
the money will be for Stratford
 
01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
to the I I need Taylor here to say I but
 
01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
I think I think they're going to be
 
01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
happy very good yeah I I really don't
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
know the exact amount but we did speak
 
01:20:11.689 --> 01:20:11.699 align:start position:0%
about this at the last executive council
 
01:20:13.729 --> 01:20:13.739 align:start position:0%
meeting uh and he did I'm just repeating
 
01:20:15.169 --> 01:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
what he already said publicly the next
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
round is coming out very shortly
 
01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:18.540 align:start position:0%
Stratford is one of our maybe the only
 
01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
one left that has applied for those
 
01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
funds so I think they're going to get a
 
01:20:24.770 --> 01:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
pretty a pretty hefty Grant is my
 
01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:26.090 align:start position:0%
pretty a pretty hefty Grant is my
understanding

01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:27.290 align:start position:0%
understanding
yeah

01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire for a question
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just had to
 
01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
respond to this thing about interest
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
um in my town the trustees of the trust
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
fund lost fifty thousand dollars this
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
past year and on investments and when we
 
01:20:46.669 --> 01:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
asked them about it they said well the
 
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
guy we invest with it recommends that we
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
keep investing so that's what we're
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
gonna do right so we have to be very
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
careful no sure and again part of it's
 
01:20:57.530 --> 01:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
just the interest rates not only do we
 
01:20:59.630 --> 01:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
have more cash but it's like just the
 
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
actual interest rates themselves where
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
we where we keep our cash you know we do
 
01:21:06.169 --> 01:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
another thing here um this is a little
 
01:21:07.850 --> 01:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
bit of an aside but it's an important
 
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
point in terms of our Dynamic you have
 
01:21:12.169 --> 01:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
banks in this state that are slowing
 
01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
down almost stopping lending because a
 
01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
lot of banks smaller banks will borrow
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
from the big Banks right but the rate to
 
01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
borrow from the big Banks out of Wall
 
01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
Street is just exorbitantly high so our
 
01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
smaller banks are slowing down their
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
lending I'm we've made a push to put
 
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
more of our just cash Holdings into the
 
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
smaller Banks and I've been working with
 
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
the uh the treasurer to do that we did
 
01:21:33.169 --> 01:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
it one round of it I think we're going
 
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
to do another if we're going to be
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
holding on to a lot of cash well then
 
01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
our bank should be holding them to a lot
 
01:21:38.689 --> 01:21:38.699 align:start position:0%
of cash right it helps them lend a
 
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
little more so we're trying our best to
 
01:21:42.649 --> 01:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
use our cash Holdings uh help some of
 
01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
the Community Banks some of them want to
 
01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
participate some of them don't for
 
01:21:47.209 --> 01:21:47.219 align:start position:0%
various reasons but anything we do just
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
to have them hold our cash so they can
 
01:21:51.169 --> 01:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
then lend against it I think just helps
 
01:21:52.689 --> 01:21:52.699 align:start position:0%
I can't help you with your local
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
decision to go with a guy who keeps
 
01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
losing you money I don't know so further
 
01:21:58.850 --> 01:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
representative Abel
 
01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you governor
 
01:22:06.050 --> 01:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
for coming uh today I just want to
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
follow up a little bit more on
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney's question about
 
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
waste water
 
01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:13.739 align:start position:0%
um I think you know there's a lot of
 
01:22:16.010 --> 01:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
discussion in the state about landfills
 
01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
there's also a lot of discussion in the
 
01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
state about pfas I think we've been
 
01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
spending an extraordinary money amount
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
of money and we've needed to on
 
01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:27.719 align:start position:0%
Wastewater and testing and dealing with
 
01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
the pfas problem I just wondered if you
 
01:22:32.689 --> 01:22:32.699 align:start position:0%
could uh share your thoughts with us a
 
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
little bit on the front end of the pipe
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
because of course the things that are
 
01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
going into our waste water are coming
 
01:22:41.709 --> 01:22:41.719 align:start position:0%
from sources that include
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
pfas we just passed a bill in the house
 
01:22:47.090 --> 01:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
yesterday that will be going to finance
 
01:22:50.330 --> 01:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
that creates uh currently unfunded Solid
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
Waste Management fund I'm thinking a lot
 
01:22:56.209 --> 01:22:56.219 align:start position:0%
about the prior funding of planning
 
01:22:58.430 --> 01:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
departments within the solid waste
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
Bureau anything you would want to add I
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
think that it would be well spent money
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
to look more at the sources of a lot of
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
the things we're having to deal with in
 
01:23:11.689 --> 01:23:11.699 align:start position:0%
our landfills and in our wastewater
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
treatment plant sure so a couple things
 
01:23:15.169 --> 01:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
look I I was a I used to design
 
01:23:16.850 --> 01:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants so like this
 
01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
is what I believe it or not I used to I
 
01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
used to say I used to I love this crap
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
um but I did I was I used to so I really
 
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate what goes in is a huge factor
 
01:23:30.050 --> 01:23:30.060 align:start position:0%
of what comes out the the cost of I'll
 
01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
I'm going to add this I'm going to start
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
with the feds because Lord knows I like
 
01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
to pick on Washington as much as I can
 
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
some of these new rules on wastewater
 
01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
treatment plants coming from Washington
 
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
are really outrageous and I would and I
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
would caution everybody on that and we
 
01:23:44.209 --> 01:23:44.219 align:start position:0%
need to push back on that as hard as we
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
can they're creating rules and systems
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
um there's a couple of smaller
 
01:23:49.370 --> 01:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants up north
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
that um they're just being asked to
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
basically measure things in a different
 
01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
way not because they're getting worse
 
01:23:57.169 --> 01:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
outcomes but by asking them to measure
 
01:23:59.450 --> 01:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
their outcomes in a different way they
 
01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
now don't meet these standards that you
 
01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
know were created for some problem that
 
01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
was that was happening in Wisconsin
 
01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
um that's literally happening to us uh
 
01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
in with a couple small plans and so
 
01:24:10.189 --> 01:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
we're trying our best to push back on on
 
01:24:11.570 --> 01:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
the federal side it can be incredibly
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
costly so I think to your point trying
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
to manage better what comes into the
 
01:24:17.689 --> 01:24:17.699 align:start position:0%
system is is always important
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
um so whether it's cleaning up on me
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
radiation sites or being Smarter with
 
01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
um you know just pre-treatment
 
01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
management I'm all for that of course I
 
01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
apologize I'm not sure if you're
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
referencing anything in particular you
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
know on the pfas stuff we just need
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
clean drinking water it's there it's a
 
01:24:35.209 --> 01:24:35.219 align:start position:0%
really really hard thing to get rid of
 
01:24:37.370 --> 01:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
it's at the level of parts per trillion
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
not parts per billion or million which
 
01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
are hard enough as it is
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
okay well just to just to clarify a
 
01:24:46.250 --> 01:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
little bit more is uh we have a brand
 
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
new Solid Waste Management plan which
 
01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:51.719 align:start position:0%
hadn't been updated since 2003 and
 
01:24:53.930 --> 01:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of goals in there to try
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
better to do better with our Solid Waste
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
Management in the state it will need
 
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
funding I'm not sure what you've put in
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
your budget but I just really wanted to
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
take this opportunity to kind of shine a
 
01:25:08.209 --> 01:25:08.219 align:start position:0%
light on the whole issue I mean
 
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a lot of discussion
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
about maybe having a new landfill in
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
this state uh the whole trash issue is
 
01:25:19.010 --> 01:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
really uh big to a lot of people and
 
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
pfas is one enormous part of it yeah so
 
01:25:25.130 --> 01:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
I would look I'm gonna I'm just gonna
 
01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
you through the softball so I'm just
 
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
going to grab it if you don't mind sure
 
01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
when we talk about landfills I'm going
 
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
to throw my two cents in
 
01:25:33.169 --> 01:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
if we become like other states and say
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to solve our landfill issue
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
by closing landfills and sending our
 
01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
trash to others to another state well
 
01:25:40.130 --> 01:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
that's not very environmentally
 
01:25:42.290 --> 01:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
responsible right that's not doing right
 
01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
by it either so this idea that we're
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
just going to close all the landfills
 
01:25:47.149 --> 01:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
and stop you know
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
we have actually for what it's worth we
 
01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
have very good landfills in the state
 
01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
compared to most States right we really
 
01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:53.270 align:start position:0%
compared to most States right we really
do

01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
um and I think they we the folks uh Mike
 
01:25:57.229 --> 01:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
wimsat and the team and the folks at DES
 
01:25:59.570 --> 01:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh do a very good job you know managing
 
01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
and keeping track of all of that but I
 
01:26:02.689 --> 01:26:02.699 align:start position:0%
just caution anybody on the landfill
 
01:26:02.699 --> 01:26:03.830 align:start position:0%
just caution anybody on the landfill
side

01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
side
 
01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
um if the answer is well we're just
 
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
going to create so many rules and
 
01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
regulations that you can't build new
 
01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:09.719 align:start position:0%
landfills here so now we're shipping it
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
to New York that's not environmentally
 
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
responsible that's cowardice that's what
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
other states do New Jersey does it
 
01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts does it look at all the
 
01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
trash we take out of Massachusetts they
 
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
want to claim that they're so
 
01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
environmentally responsible but they
 
01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
refuse to clean up their own mess and
 
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
we're picking we're doing it for them
 
01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
right I get as frustrated about that as
 
01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
anybody but the answer isn't we're going
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
to keep kicking that can and literally
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
kicking that used can and we're going to
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
send it to Upstate New York or something
 
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
else so we have to be responsible about
 
01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
that about taking that on and I think
 
01:26:39.649 --> 01:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity to do it with the
 
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
right regulations and the right
 
01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
boundaries and all that sort of thing we
 
01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
do it very well but this idea that we're
 
01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
just going to be a NIMBY State that's
 
01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:48.300 align:start position:0%
that's we take care of ourselves in New
 
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think there's a sense of
 
01:26:50.689 --> 01:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
pride in doing that and doing it smart
 
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
and same thing on the wastewater
 
01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
treatment plants right we don't want to
 
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
send our Wastewater somewhere else we
 
01:26:57.050 --> 01:26:57.060 align:start position:0%
got to take care of it and and do it
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
right by it so
 
01:26:59.810 --> 01:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
um yeah I've seen the new Solid Waste
 
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
plan it's great
 
01:27:02.930 --> 01:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
um I had some issues with some of it but
 
01:27:04.669 --> 01:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
overall it at least gets us you know 20
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Governor any any further
 
01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:15.780 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you for your
 
01:27:18.110 --> 01:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
immersion in the budget great and your
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
attention to all the issues that are
 
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
circulating in the legislation no you
 
01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
bet and I'm going to have James and the
 
01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
team stick around I don't know if you
 
01:27:24.290 --> 01:27:24.300 align:start position:0%
have any more questions for them but if
 
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
you do you know feel free but I'll have
 
01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
them stick around for a while thank you
 
01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:42.169 --> 01:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
thank you director Edgar for staying
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions I think
 
01:27:45.169 --> 01:27:45.179 align:start position:0%
the governor went through most of them
 
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
but if there's any further questions
 
01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
um questions or certainly if you need
 
01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
looking for any more detail if I don't
 
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
have it now I can certainly provide it
 
01:27:57.410 --> 01:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
uh in a timely manner
 
01:27:59.450 --> 01:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
question from representative Campbells
 
01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
um going back to the Men's prison uh is
 
01:28:08.209 --> 01:28:08.219 align:start position:0%
one of the options is being looked at is
 
01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
to renovate what's already existing at
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
maybe 40 50 million dollars versus
 
01:28:15.709 --> 01:28:15.719 align:start position:0%
breaking ground on a 400 million dollar
 
01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:17.219 align:start position:0%
new prison
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh I I believe in and certainly the
 
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections uh can can
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
better answer that question more than me
 
01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that the current
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
prison is in such a state that it will
 
01:28:30.890 --> 01:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
be cheaper and believe it or not less
 
01:28:32.930 --> 01:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
expensive to build a new one rather than
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
representative Edgar for a question Ed
 
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
Edwards for Edgar uh some um Mr Edgar
 
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
um we we funded or wanted to fund I'm
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
having a hard time remembering exactly
 
01:28:52.810 --> 01:28:52.820 align:start position:0%
what we did the secure forensic hospital
 
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
and it's run into some troubles because
 
01:28:57.530 --> 01:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
we've tried to co-locate it with a New
 
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and there's swamp and
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
ground issues there uh I'm just
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
wondering if because of the delay should
 
01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
there be some supplemental money in the
 
01:29:12.169 --> 01:29:12.179 align:start position:0%
capital or one-time expenditures that
 
01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
slide that you showed to to to make sure
 
01:29:17.629 --> 01:29:17.639 align:start position:0%
that we're okay with the secure forensic
 
01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
Hospital what what are your thoughts uh
 
01:29:22.729 --> 01:29:22.739 align:start position:0%
first uh overall correction my name is
 
01:29:25.850 --> 01:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
James Gary g-e-r-r-y so
 
01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:27.430 align:start position:0%
James Gary g-e-r-r-y so
um

01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
not a problem uh I'm sorry it is
 
01:29:33.290 --> 01:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
director Edgar our director Gary
 
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
director Gary director Gary yeah yes sir
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
I'll keep practicing until I get it
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
directly Geary thank you
 
01:29:42.169 --> 01:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
um for the forensic hospital it was
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
originally supposed to be completed I
 
01:29:48.290 --> 01:29:48.300 align:start position:0%
believe uh right around July uh first of
 
01:29:51.770 --> 01:29:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh 2024. however that's been delayed now
 
01:29:55.129 --> 01:29:55.139 align:start position:0%
and it's looking like a completion date
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the Fall To December of 2025 which is
 
01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
outside of this biennium
 
01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:04.010 align:start position:0%
outside of this biennium
so

01:30:04.010 --> 01:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
um we we do not have any uh funding in
 
01:30:10.189 --> 01:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
the budget for for personnel because you
 
01:30:12.110 --> 01:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
know we don't believe they'll be able to
 
01:30:13.970 --> 01:30:13.980 align:start position:0%
start hiring until after this biennium
 
01:30:16.129 --> 01:30:16.139 align:start position:0%
is over however there is flexibility
 
01:30:20.990 --> 01:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
here whereas if if the construction were
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
to uh speed up or they would have find a
 
01:30:26.810 --> 01:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
solution to their problems that they
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
could come back uh certainly to the
 
01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee to get funding for
 
01:30:33.770 --> 01:30:33.780 align:start position:0%
positions they need
 
01:30:36.530 --> 01:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
follow up so so I wasn't thinking about
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
the operational money I figured that was
 
01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
going to work itself out I was really
 
01:30:43.490 --> 01:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
specifically referring to the delay in
 
01:30:46.129 --> 01:30:46.139 align:start position:0%
construction and what that may do given
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
the rates of inflation and supply chain
 
01:30:50.450 --> 01:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
shortages to whether or not we've
 
01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
adequately funded the capital side and
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should be anticipating
 
01:30:58.129 --> 01:30:58.139 align:start position:0%
a reserve now to make sure that we can
 
01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:00.780 align:start position:0%
complete the project we aren't aware of
 
01:31:04.250 --> 01:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
any cost overruns you know as as of now
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
however uh is anyone familiar with
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
projects uh especially over this last
 
01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
few years are concerned is that they
 
01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
tend to be delayed and come in
 
01:31:19.250 --> 01:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
overpriced while we have not included
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
that in in this budget uh that that's
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
something certainly we could take a look
 
01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:24.830 align:start position:0%
something certainly we could take a look
at

01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:31:26.330 --> 01:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
because I mean it would not it wouldn't
 
01:31:28.610 --> 01:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
shock me and no projects now that comes
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
in over budget
 
01:31:32.810 --> 01:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a surprise
 
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
representative Hull for a question thank
 
01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
you chairman so I'm looking at page
 
01:31:40.129 --> 01:31:40.139 align:start position:0%
three of the handout that the governor
 
01:31:42.290 --> 01:31:42.300 align:start position:0%
turned out this morning thank you
 
01:31:45.110 --> 01:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
um for giving us hard copies so this is
 
01:31:47.450 --> 01:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
in relative relative to the unrestricted
 
01:31:49.570 --> 01:31:49.580 align:start position:0%
Revenue at the state level
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
and we see effectively flat lining
 
01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
between actual 22 and projected 23
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
actually there's a decrease of 100
 
01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
million dollars that then continues into
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
24 and 25.
 
01:32:05.649 --> 01:32:05.659 align:start position:0%
and I guess my concern stems around from
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
where we know we have a 20 or
 
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.490 align:start position:0%
where we know we have a 20 or
thereabouts

01:32:10.490 --> 01:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
thereabouts
 
01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:11.390 align:start position:0%
thereabouts
um

01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate in the various agencies
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
across the entire department we're going
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
to do a a significant increase in
 
01:32:21.169 --> 01:32:21.179 align:start position:0%
salaries for various employees which
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
will probably as the governor said
 
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
increase the number of employees and
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
decrease the vacancy rate I'm not sure
 
01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
how the math model Works Beyond 24.25
 
01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
when you see a significant step in terms
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
of number of people employed and and
 
01:32:39.410 --> 01:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
their respective salaries yet the the
 
01:32:41.570 --> 01:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
revenue to the state is is effectively
 
01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
flatlined right uh thank you for the
 
01:32:47.450 --> 01:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
question the answer is is that we what
 
01:32:51.890 --> 01:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
we've done is uh the the overall pay
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
increase over the biennium is going to
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
be roughly 100 million dollars
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
with most of it coming actually in in
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
year two uh because you have a
 
01:33:06.169 --> 01:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
compounding effect from the 10 and the
 
01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
two percent
 
01:33:10.250 --> 01:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
and what we've done here is we've
 
01:33:14.450 --> 01:33:14.460 align:start position:0%
assumed that the positions that we've
 
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
added in other words all the funded
 
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
positions are funded at the at the new
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:29.330 --> 01:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
so I guess
 
01:33:31.850 --> 01:33:31.860 align:start position:0%
um if all of those positions are funded
 
01:33:33.530 --> 01:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
one of the things that drove these
 
01:33:36.290 --> 01:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
historically High
 
01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:37.370 align:start position:0%
historically High
um

01:33:37.370 --> 01:33:37.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
lapses which left us with so much extra
 
01:33:42.770 --> 01:33:42.780 align:start position:0%
cash is the fact that the Departments
 
01:33:45.169 --> 01:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
have such low or such high vacancy rates
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
right there are a number of open
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
positions yes if we start the assumption
 
01:33:51.410 --> 01:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
that we're going to fill all those
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
positions those lapses won't be there in
 
01:33:56.209 --> 01:33:56.219 align:start position:0%
the future and how do we manage at that
 
01:33:58.250 --> 01:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
time write this extra 100 million
 
01:34:00.530 --> 01:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
dollars per per year in terms of
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
additional costs with a flatlined
 
01:34:03.890 --> 01:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
revenue that's correct I'm quickly
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
looking for the for the lapse numbers
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
but uh the the lapses over time
 
01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
especially going to 2425 decrease
 
01:34:17.570 --> 01:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
so two more historical levels you'll see
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh and I say if I have a few minutes I
 
01:34:22.850 --> 01:34:22.860 align:start position:0%
can look for it but you you'll see in 23
 
01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
we have a higher lapse number because of
 
01:34:26.930 --> 01:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
the high vacancy rate and that number
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
drops dramatically for 24 and 25
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
assuming that we're going to fill these
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:43.490 --> 01:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative waller for a question
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
the chairman Weiler and thank you for
 
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
being here Mr Gary
 
01:34:49.610 --> 01:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
um one thing you hear a lot about in the
 
01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:50.390 align:start position:0%
um one thing you hear a lot about in the
news

01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
news
 
01:34:53.629 --> 01:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
is the need for child care
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
and it affects employers and affects
 
01:34:58.970 --> 01:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
families and it affects providers we're
 
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
trying to provide the service and I
 
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
wonder if there's any initiatives in the
 
01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.030 align:start position:0%
wonder if there's any initiatives in the
budget

01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:35:06.649 --> 01:35:06.659 align:start position:0%
to start to address some of the child
 
01:35:09.410 --> 01:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
care concerns
 
01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:12.770 align:start position:0%
care concerns
um

01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:15.169 --> 01:35:15.179 align:start position:0%
for that I'm going to have to uh I will
 
01:35:17.209 --> 01:35:17.219 align:start position:0%
research that and get back to you
 
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
for that information there there is
 
01:35:20.689 --> 01:35:20.699 align:start position:0%
money in here I just don't have those
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
numbers off the top of my head
 
01:35:24.290 --> 01:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
great thank you I would really
 
01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire for a question
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you director
 
01:35:31.199 --> 01:35:32.510 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you director
Gary

01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
Gary
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
um I want to follow up on representative
 
01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
Hull's question so he referred you to
 
01:35:38.930 --> 01:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
page three in today's handout that's the
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
same as page 15 in the big document or
 
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
the green document
 
01:35:46.850 --> 01:35:46.860 align:start position:0%
but page 16 of the green document
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to match page 15. so
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
um specifically if you look at the sum
 
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
of general fund and education fund on
 
01:36:00.410 --> 01:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
page 16 the numbers are quite different
 
01:36:03.709 --> 01:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
than the ones on page 15 and maybe this
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
is something you'd have to research but
 
01:36:08.209 --> 01:36:08.219 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why why don't they sort of
 
01:36:10.129 --> 01:36:10.139 align:start position:0%
match up if you look for example at
 
01:36:15.250 --> 01:36:15.260 align:start position:0%
actual fiscal 22 general fund 1.6
 
01:36:20.590 --> 01:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
education fund 1.1 the sum is
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
2.7 or something but over here it's 3.2
 
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
you see what I mean all right well on on
 
01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
page on page 15 you're looking at a
 
01:36:32.450 --> 01:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
combined General and education fund yes
 
01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:34.010 align:start position:0%
combined General and education fund yes
right

01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
but go to 16. actual see general fund
 
01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:40.550 align:start position:0%
but go to 16. actual see general fund
1.6

01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
1.6
 
01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
and see education fund 1.1
 
01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
you add those two up you get 2.7
 
01:36:50.450 --> 01:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
01:37:04.669 --> 01:37:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.410 --> 01:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing that's a research question
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
but no if you
 
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
uh for fiscal year what what year are
 
01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
you looking at actual fiscal year 22.
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
okay fiscal your actual 22 uh
 
01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
three point two
 
01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:22.729 align:start position:0%
three point two
billion

01:37:22.729 --> 01:37:22.739 align:start position:0%
billion
 
01:37:22.739 --> 01:37:24.350 align:start position:0%
billion
and

01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
well because
 
01:37:28.930 --> 01:37:28.940 align:start position:0%
this is this is specific specific funds
 
01:37:34.490 --> 01:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
and so for the for the education and uh
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
General funds you'd be you would include
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
some of the liquor money
 
01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:40.669 align:start position:0%
some of the liquor money
um

01:37:40.669 --> 01:37:40.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
as well into that I believe so that may
 
01:37:45.110 --> 01:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
be the difference see I don't think so
 
01:37:47.689 --> 01:37:47.699 align:start position:0%
because in the recommended so as you go
 
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
further along they get closer and closer
 
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
that calculation so okay there's
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
something weird about 22 and 23 compared
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
to 24 and 25. okay I can I can research
 
01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
that and get back to you that's not a
 
01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:03.770 align:start position:0%
that and get back to you that's not a
problem

01:38:03.770 --> 01:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of things that I
 
01:38:07.729 --> 01:38:07.739 align:start position:0%
noticed in recent handouts that we've
 
01:38:07.739 --> 01:38:08.570 align:start position:0%
noticed in recent handouts that we've
had

01:38:08.570 --> 01:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
uh from various divisions and committees
 
01:38:15.050 --> 01:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
one of them was the surprise that the
 
01:38:17.930 --> 01:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
list of uh employees seem to be fairly
 
01:38:19.610 --> 01:38:19.620 align:start position:0%
steady across
 
01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
several years and we keep hearing about
 
01:38:23.629 --> 01:38:23.639 align:start position:0%
all these vacancies but they don't seem
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
to be listed at the what the list I
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
looked at seemed to show
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
quite a level number of employees
 
01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
another piece that I looked at was from
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
the retirement system and it showed the
 
01:38:37.490 --> 01:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
number of people leaving the retirement
 
01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
system the surprise to me was those with
 
01:38:44.090 --> 01:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
less than a year the leaving was 25
 
01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:45.709 align:start position:0%
less than a year the leaving was 25
percent

01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:38:48.290 --> 01:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
it seems to me we may have a problem not
 
01:38:50.450 --> 01:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
only with are we hiring the right people
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
or why aren't we retaining them is it a
 
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
hostile work environment and I've heard
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
that testimony from a person that it is
 
01:39:00.290 --> 01:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
a hostile work environment so that's
 
01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:39:02.689 --> 01:39:02.699 align:start position:0%
ought to be brought to the governor's
 
01:39:04.490 --> 01:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
attention so that he could share with
 
01:39:06.530 --> 01:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
the other Commissioners and directors
 
01:39:09.649 --> 01:39:09.659 align:start position:0%
that looking at data like that 25
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
percent are leaving in their first year
 
01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
kind of shocking
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
um something needs to be done about it
 
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we have this big
 
01:39:19.970 --> 01:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
turnover and maybe that's why the number
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
of employees if you're listing four
 
01:39:24.410 --> 01:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
people in the same job
 
01:39:26.450 --> 01:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
one leaving every quarter maybe it looks
 
01:39:28.490 --> 01:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
like more employees but
 
01:39:30.050 --> 01:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire you wanted to
 
01:39:32.330 --> 01:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
comment on that yes I have somewhat of
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
an answer because I have a bill related
 
01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
to exactly this being heard at two
 
01:39:39.770 --> 01:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
o'clock today in Edna so so there's
 
01:39:42.110 --> 01:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
there's two sets of figures here in
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
terms of how many people quit one is
 
01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
what does the retirement system assume
 
01:39:50.290 --> 01:39:50.300 align:start position:0%
which is the 25
 
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
and then and then 18 and so on there's a
 
01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
list that's what they assume from their
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know books or something but then
 
01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
there's the actual experience so there
 
01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
was there's a table of they did a study
 
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
from 2016 to 2019 and and it's very
 
01:40:11.450 --> 01:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
little in the first year maybe two or
 
01:40:13.610 --> 01:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
three percent and then the second year
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
is more like 11 and then 11 and then so
 
01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
it's so the actual experience study
 
01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
compared to what the retirement system
 
01:40:24.530 --> 01:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
assumes there's a big disconnect there
 
01:40:26.570 --> 01:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
um especially in the early years so
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's an assumption rather than a fact
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
exactly and but
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
there's also very in the different
 
01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
categories that the retirement system
 
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
has uh standard employees teachers
 
01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
police and fire there's very different
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
experience that funnel of sort of how
 
01:40:48.290 --> 01:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
many people you hire and then the next
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
year those there's some quit and then
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
the next year some quit and so on down
 
01:40:55.490 --> 01:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
to the end are different shapes for
 
01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
those different categories of employees
 
01:40:58.850 --> 01:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
anyways it's very interesting subject
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
but I can show you some tables
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
um I'll be there it's not really 25 yeah
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
per the questions from director gear for
 
01:41:13.850 --> 01:41:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.890 --> 01:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
represent representative papavichi
 
01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
Mueller thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
director for taking the question I'm I'm
 
01:41:22.010 --> 01:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
not sure if it's a policy question or a
 
01:41:23.810 --> 01:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
budget question or we were talking
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
earlier about landfill space and one
 
01:41:27.649 --> 01:41:27.659 align:start position:0%
Associated issue that the town of
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
Windham is struggling with is that right
 
01:41:31.970 --> 01:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
now it costs us more to dispose of
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
recyclables that it costs us to dispose
 
01:41:37.129 --> 01:41:37.139 align:start position:0%
of trash now part of what I was told is
 
01:41:39.050 --> 01:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
that it's because of the policies of the
 
01:41:40.609 --> 01:41:40.619 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts where we
 
01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
apparently have to move our stuff but
 
01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
is that something that
 
01:41:47.870 --> 01:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
would make sense to you know look at is
 
01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
the state you know from the governor's
 
01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:50.590 align:start position:0%
the state you know from the governor's
office

01:41:50.590 --> 01:41:50.600 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
policies suggestions on how to handle
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
those things because honestly it kind of
 
01:41:58.729 --> 01:41:58.739 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense that you have to pay
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
more to dispose of recyclables after
 
01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
you've done all the work of separating
 
01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:03.709 align:start position:0%
you've done all the work of separating
them

01:42:03.709 --> 01:42:03.719 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
then you you know pay to dispose of
 
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
trash where you just put it into you
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
know a bag so I just as I said I don't
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
know if it's an appropriate question for
 
01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
you but since the topic came up I
 
01:42:17.090 --> 01:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
figured no harm in asking yeah I I think
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
it is a policy question and it's a very
 
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
good question I think is one that that
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be looked at uh as the governor
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
said so long as we're not shipping it to
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
New York we're you know and taking care
 
01:42:28.850 --> 01:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
of it ourselves so we're always looking
 
01:42:32.330 --> 01:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
for the the best way and the most uh
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
financially feasible way to to to solve
 
01:42:39.649 --> 01:42:39.659 align:start position:0%
this problem and if uh if if you uh or
 
01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
or any of your uh
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
um fellow Representatives have have
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
ideas on how to do that we'd love to
 
01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
listen thank you I was looking to listen
 
01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
to yours but I appreciate that it's our
 
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:57.290 --> 01:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
represent Petrie for a question
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:43:03.229 --> 01:43:03.239 align:start position:0%
being here uh the uh uh yeah the
 
01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
retirement system liability
 
01:43:08.330 --> 01:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
have you done any numbers to say if we
 
01:43:10.609 --> 01:43:10.619 align:start position:0%
put uh and it's I believe it's funded at
 
01:43:14.330 --> 01:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
around 65 percent is there any table
 
01:43:16.850 --> 01:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
where if you put 50 million it would
 
01:43:19.250 --> 01:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
bring it up to 75 percent if you've done
 
01:43:22.970 --> 01:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
any work on that at all uh I I have not
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
and and we have not uh we we have relied
 
01:43:28.250 --> 01:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
on the retirement system uh for for
 
01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:31.340 align:start position:0%
their numbers and we've worked with them
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
and uh you know we'll continue to do
 
01:43:42.290 --> 01:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:44.689 --> 01:43:44.699 align:start position:0%

where we can contact you
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:28.030 --> 01:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
representative education
 
01:44:30.169 --> 01:44:30.179 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:44:30.179 --> 01:44:31.310 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
so this is kind of a follow-up to a
 
01:44:35.930 --> 01:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
question I was asking the governor
 
01:44:39.290 --> 01:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
um and that is that as you look at the
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
budget he's able to show where we're
 
01:44:46.010 --> 01:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
investing well he's able to show where
 
01:44:48.430 --> 01:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
there's a tax that we might cut
 
01:44:51.530 --> 01:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this budget that I
 
01:44:55.310 --> 01:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
can see for that we're targeting as Bill
 
01:44:57.950 --> 01:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
payers for some of the things that we
 
01:45:00.109 --> 01:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
know we need to spend more money on such
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
as salaries you know let's let's let's
 
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
assume that the Medicaid rate of 3.1 is
 
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
probably too low for where we're really
 
01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
at is there a list of Bill payers
 
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
programs that the governor might
 
01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
anticipate needs actually fewer
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
resources than what he's asked for
 
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
is there like a double secret list
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere where we can go and see where
 
01:45:31.850 --> 01:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
the priorities are to reduce spending if
 
01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
we had to
 
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh we we have not had we did if if that
 
01:45:39.530 --> 01:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
list exists uh it is so secret that I
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
have not been privy to it
 
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
um what uh the the advantage of this
 
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
budget is we've sort of been dealing
 
01:45:49.129 --> 01:45:49.139 align:start position:0%
from a position of strength and you're
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
right spending does increase and it
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
increases roughly 11 12 over the
 
01:45:56.689 --> 01:45:56.699 align:start position:0%
biennium uh which is pretty much right
 
01:45:58.970 --> 01:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
alongside of inflation and in addition
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
to that what we've done in this budget
 
01:46:04.010 --> 01:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
is we've been playing catch-up uh in the
 
01:46:05.810 --> 01:46:05.820 align:start position:0%
last biennium we had a lot of spending
 
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
cuts we moved a lot of agencies off of
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
general fund revenues and and put them
 
01:46:13.970 --> 01:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
on to specialized Revenue sources which
 
01:46:16.250 --> 01:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
are being drained uh one example is
 
01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
there's the highway fund and uh with the
 
01:46:23.090 --> 01:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
the money going there uh on the last
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
budget the legislature paraded 50
 
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars a general fund just to
 
01:46:30.590 --> 01:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
keep the highway funds solvent uh we've
 
01:46:32.689 --> 01:46:32.699 align:start position:0%
seen Fish and Game sort of China you
 
01:46:35.209 --> 01:46:35.219 align:start position:0%
know drawing down on on on their
 
01:46:38.570 --> 01:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
revenues and so what we've done is a put
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
back some of the spending cuts we did
 
01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
through the biennium through covid and
 
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
then number two we've moved agencies and
 
01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
departments off of their specialized
 
01:46:50.450 --> 01:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
funds which have a limited life back to
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
the general fund which is why you see
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
the increase there
 
01:46:57.229 --> 01:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
um if certainly if if revenues don't
 
01:47:01.250 --> 01:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
come in as projected uh if uh we need
 
01:47:02.930 --> 01:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
there is some sort of event in the world
 
01:47:06.410 --> 01:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
that uh you know causes a severe
 
01:47:08.209 --> 01:47:08.219 align:start position:0%
recession in the state and we need to to
 
01:47:10.850 --> 01:47:10.860 align:start position:0%
cut back on programs we can come up with
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:17.930 --> 01:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
uh director Gary I was I'm just tempted
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
to say you know if you want to share it
 
01:47:21.649 --> 01:47:21.659 align:start position:0%
with me sooner rather than later that
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
way we can prepare for the end of the
 
01:47:25.970 --> 01:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
world together so all right thank you
 
01:47:27.410 --> 01:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:29.450 --> 01:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
some of the things I observe when we do
 
01:47:31.370 --> 01:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
a big pay raise
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
usually it goes on the anniversary date
 
01:47:37.850 --> 01:47:37.860 align:start position:0%
of their hiring or some anniversary date
 
01:47:40.250 --> 01:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
or promotion or something are we
 
01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
following along with that in the
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
agreement I don't have any
 
01:47:46.970 --> 01:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
any word of the agreement you might and
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
if so
 
01:47:50.689 --> 01:47:50.699 align:start position:0%
how will it spread out is there an ideas
 
01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
likely not even leave across every state
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
every month rather for this increase and
 
01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:57.950 align:start position:0%
every month rather for this increase and
also

01:47:57.950 --> 01:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
the one that's making a hundred thousand
 
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
is going to get twice as much of of a
 
01:48:04.490 --> 01:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
pay raise if we do ten percent than the
 
01:48:06.590 --> 01:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
one who's making fifty thousand is there
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
any realization within the contract on
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
that yeah there's not and that this
 
01:48:15.530 --> 01:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
works like like a typical uh
 
01:48:18.410 --> 01:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
pay raise one that's been bargained with
 
01:48:21.709 --> 01:48:21.719 align:start position:0%
the Union would do so what happens is is
 
01:48:23.689 --> 01:48:23.699 align:start position:0%
that the 10 percent becomes effective on
 
01:48:28.129 --> 01:48:28.139 align:start position:0%
this July 1st July 1st 2023 uh across
 
01:48:30.530 --> 01:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
the board to every state worker uh
 
01:48:33.169 --> 01:48:33.179 align:start position:0%
following that on July 1st 2024 will be
 
01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:35.639 align:start position:0%
an additional two percent so it doesn't
 
01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
it's not phased in on their anniversary
 
01:48:39.169 --> 01:48:39.179 align:start position:0%
dates or their higher dates it's it's
 
01:48:42.050 --> 01:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
everyone will receive a pay increase on
 
01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2023 of 10 we need to do that
 
01:48:46.609 --> 01:48:46.619 align:start position:0%
we need to know that when we're doing
 
01:48:48.890 --> 01:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
further uh thank you and this is just a
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up to your question
 
01:48:54.649 --> 01:48:54.659 align:start position:0%
representative Wilder and that is on I
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
was listening to the governor on Drew
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
Klein this morning and the question was
 
01:49:00.169 --> 01:49:00.179 align:start position:0%
asked who who would be subject to
 
01:49:02.930 --> 01:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
receiving the 10 percent and I I think
 
01:49:06.410 --> 01:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
on the radio he said everyone that he is
 
01:49:08.330 --> 01:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
in a position to negotiate the union
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
contracts with and at the point he
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
didn't know and he wasn't willing to say
 
01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:15.659 align:start position:0%
because he wasn't sure whether it meant
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
the other employees that are not under
 
01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
Union contracts could you could you
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
clarify if it truly is all employees
 
01:49:24.890 --> 01:49:24.900 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not they're
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
under a contract it is all employees
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
further questions from director for
 
01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
I don't see any
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your expertise we'll be in
 
01:49:42.890 --> 01:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
touch thank you and thank you for having
 
01:49:46.250 --> 01:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:48.290 --> 01:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
any of the other folks want to make any
 
01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:53.750 align:start position:0%
any of the other folks want to make any
comment

01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:56.090 --> 01:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
I'll just say on the HHS question for
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
the 3.1 percent
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
um that was proposed by HHS
 
01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
um so that's where that number came from
 
01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:09.649 --> 01:50:09.659 align:start position:0%
right members I believe we have some
 
01:50:12.290 --> 01:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
divisions starting at one o'clock to
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
work on on the budget sections and uh
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
we will now
 
01:50:20.570 --> 01:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
a good time to break for lunch thank you
 
01:50:23.570 --> 01:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attendance
 
01:50:25.850 --> 01:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
so division three we're done for the day
 
01:50:33.890 --> 01:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:36.649 --> 01:50:36.659 align:start position:0%
and those of you that are on the fiscal
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
committee for Friday will have a
 
01:50:48.530 --> 01:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:51.139 align:start position:0%
