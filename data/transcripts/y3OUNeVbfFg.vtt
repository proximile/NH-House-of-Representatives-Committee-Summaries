00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
I will open the session
 
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
on subcommittee work session on House
 
00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
Bill 580 FN establishing a children's
 
00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 align:start position:0%
vision screening initiative within the
 
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
State Medicaid
 
00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 align:start position:0%
Program um so we have no members of the
 
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
public here uh to give testimony so um I
 
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
guess we should probably Dive Right In
 
00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh how would you like to approach this I
 
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
should I State my concerns and then we
 
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
can kind of work from there or would you
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
you I think be helpful to myself Mr
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
chair to have you voice your concerns
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
and try to weed those into how I can
 
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
respond to it yeah that would give you
 
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
more of a an opportunity to respond to
 
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
those so or you can respond as we go if
 
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
you prefer um we can keep this pretty
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
informal um
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
so I guess my first observation on going
 
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
back through the bill and I I I
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
apologize because I had forgotten a lot
 
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
of detail about it but my first
 
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
concern is that the fundamentally the
 
00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 align:start position:0%
title of this bill is is
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
misleading um this is not just an
 
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
expansion under
 
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um in fact all three Medicaid
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
plans that cover children in New
 
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently cover Vision Care
 
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
um this is what this bill really is
 
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
about is creating a compulsory vision
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
screening requirement for all all
 
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
students in public schools in New
 
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.790 align:start position:0%
students in public schools in New
Hampshire

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
um so whether you think that's a good
 
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
idea or a bad idea it's it's it's quite
 
00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 align:start position:0%
different from the title of the bill and
 
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
so I I guess I feel like we need to be
 
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
focused on addressing whether or not
 
00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
that is proper and whether it is
 
00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
implemented properly
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
um so under the Medicaid Program
 
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
children up to 19 years meaning zero to
 
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
18 um get you know their entitled to
 
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.070 align:start position:0%
18 um get you know their entitled to
vision

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
vision
 
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.070 align:start position:0%
vision
coverage

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
um non-medicaid Pro program uh
 
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.430 align:start position:0%
um non-medicaid Pro program uh
non-medicaid

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
non-medicaid
 
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
families uh will be required to get a
 
00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
vision screening and for most that will
 
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
not cost them anything out of pocket
 
00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
because vision screening is considered
 
00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
to be an essential health benefit under
 
00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
the Affordable Care Act yes and no
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
yes and no depending on the health plan
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
or yes and no depend did some research
 
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
last night after our call and what I
 
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
found out and I brought it with me is
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
that under the state exchange programs
 
00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:45.159 align:start position:0%
and ones that are done through certain
 
00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
agencies it's a requirement if you will
 
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
it's part of the package however if
 
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
you're under Arisa plans that is one of
 
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
the things that they don't have to cover
 
00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:56.919 align:start position:0%
okay and most of the people in the state
 
00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
are covered by self-employed so I
 
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
brought the documentation so um the
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
chair could read through this as well so
 
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
I wasn't misunderstanding or misreading
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
it okay so I think we actually came to
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
the same conclusion because I said for
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
those with ACA compliant HealthCare
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
coverage correct there's no cost however
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
there are people who have n health plans
 
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
that are not ACA compliant in the in so
 
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
far as they don't conform to that
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
essential health benefit requirement you
 
00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
brought up one example another example
 
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:32.200 align:start position:0%
is IAL medical sharing plans um like a
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
medical sharing Ministry like meta share
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
I don't know if meta share specifically
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
covers uh Vision or not I probably
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
should because that's the plan I'm on
 
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
but um I I don't believe that it does
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
um so so I guess in in reviewing this I
 
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
I sort of really started to reframe it
 
00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
as this is really not about establishing
 
00:08:59.389 --> 00:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
a benefit under the Medicaid programs so
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
much as it because that already exists
 
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
what this is really about is saying we
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
want to make vision screening compulsory
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
for children in public schools in New
 
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the only out in this case is a
 
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.670 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the only out in this case is a
religious

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
religious
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
exemption and the reason that that
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
language appears the way it does is
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
because if you look at
 
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.829 align:start position:0%
because if you look at
RSA

00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
32 um this is the section of Statute
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
that that part of the bill is seeking to
 
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
amend this basically just copies that
 
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
part of the bill so or that part of the
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
RSA so RSA 200 section
 
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.910 align:start position:0%
RSA so RSA 200 section
32

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
32
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
says you have to have a every child
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
shall have a physical exam upon their
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
first upon their entry into a public
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
school system or first Contact first
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
entry into a public school
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
system unless there is a religious basis
 
00:09:58.509 --> 00:09:58.519 align:start position:0%
for for opting out of that and so
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
basically they just just copied that
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
language and I concur with what you're
 
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
saying I think you're hit the nail on
 
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
the head quite frankly that is it's a
 
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
it's a form of a mandate it's not so
 
00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
much the economics the question about
 
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
the Mandate however I believe we tackled
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
this issue before that no screening or
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
health any kind of an exam could be done
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
without the parental approval so
 
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
therefore the parents do have the option
 
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
to opt out of
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
this okay they don't
 
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.509 align:start position:0%
this okay they don't
so

00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:30.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
that so that raises the question and
 
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
it's a question I had about this bill I
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
have a concern about the bill that
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
parents can opt out but there's no
 
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
notification provision in the bill is
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
there a notification requirement
 
00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:45.399 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in statute because I know we
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
have it for dental uh but I wasn't clear
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
on whether we have it broadly speaking
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
for other medical procedures I went to
 
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
bed before I get to that point okay so
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
but I do agree with what you're saying I
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
think we need to go back and look at
 
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.550 align:start position:0%
think we need to go back and look at
that

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:03.069 --> 00:11:03.079 align:start position:0%
because give you two examples why I'm
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
concerned with this it's building the
 
00:11:07.629 --> 00:11:07.639 align:start position:0%
awareness and part of it is my wife was
 
00:11:09.629 --> 00:11:09.639 align:start position:0%
a school nurse for many years and she
 
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
did many hearing and vision screenings
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
but she only did it when the parent
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
approved of it so there was a card it
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
was sent to the parents of the child and
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
the parent had to be very specific and
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
check off everything they wanted to be
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
done if it wasn't checked off she would
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
not do it okay so even though it was
 
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
before we had this whole issue of
 
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
parenteral approval she relied upon the
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
parents giving her permission to begin
 
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
with but more importantly I have
 
00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.590 align:start position:0%
with but more importantly I have
a

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
granddaughter who was struggling
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
struggling in school and it wasn't until
 
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
the second almost the end of the second
 
00:11:51.069 --> 00:11:51.079 align:start position:0%
year that someone said wait a minute she
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
can't see the
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
Blackboard and if someone had taken the
 
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:57.519 align:start position:0%
time to do a screening when she came
 
00:11:59.550 --> 00:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
into the school she she would not have
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
lost two years of her academic life
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
struggling because she couldn't have
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
glasses and once they put the glasses on
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
her she wow that's a chalkboard I can
 
00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.150 align:start position:0%
her she wow that's a chalkboard I can
actually

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
see and in my my daughter is not
 
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
uneducated they don't lack the economics
 
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
of it they lack the awareness of it and
 
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
that's my concern is how do we build
 
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
greater awareness amongst the the
 
00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
population in order to be sure that
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
they're taken care
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
of so
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
we had talked briefly about this
 
00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
beforehand and one of my so I I think
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
having listened to this and talking to
 
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
the chairman just before you got in here
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant was basically in
 
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
my mind two broad categories one is
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
philosophically a mandate for
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
screening but then the second part of it
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
which I agree with also is that there
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
are certain parts of this could be
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
tightened up so to speak so you know
 
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
things like in my mind in the on the
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
first page the bottom there should
 
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
provide reimbursement for and then it
 
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
says list all the people I I think that
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
really ought to be just changed to
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
Simply qualified providers because
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about you know
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
because it reminding me today when I was
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
at CVS getting my uh coid vaccine it was
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
done by a technician which 10 years ago
 
00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:22.839 align:start position:0%
would never have been done so the scope
 
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
of practice is going to change going
 
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
forward for so many people in healthcare
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
and if that's appropriate then I would
 
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
basically just get rid of listing those
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
that can give it and basically say you
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
know qualified providers you know that
 
00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
sort of thing when we talked about this
 
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
previously about the religious exemption
 
00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
on the on the second page there I would
 
00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
have just ended that sentence as at the
 
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
guardian objects there to in writing
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
period that's all there is you you
 
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
object to it it doesn't have to give a
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
reason you just object to it that's fine
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
but I I think we can get rid of
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
something like that so I agree with the
 
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
fact that there may be things that need
 
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
to be tightened up but on the other hand
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
even at the top you know the chairman
 
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this is misleading in its
 
00:14:07.949 --> 00:14:07.959 align:start position:0%
title perhaps again it would address the
 
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh potential compulsory nature of the
 
00:14:11.749 --> 00:14:11.759 align:start position:0%
bill which it really is when you talk
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
about it if you change that title to
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
establish an AM manatory children screen
 
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
children vision screening initiative
 
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about so I
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
mean little things like that could be
 
00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:23.959 align:start position:0%
tightened up a little bit to make it
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
more palatable but then we have to get
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
beyond the question of philosophically
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
do we even want to have a compulsory or
 
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.829 align:start position:0%
do we even want to have a compulsory or
mandatory

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
screening from a clinical perspective
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
and like yourself I have a daughter who
 
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
had stabismus but once the stabismus is
 
00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:40.759 align:start position:0%
corrected at an early age the
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
development of the child is much
 
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
enhanced it also is one of those things
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
where if you can pick up with you know
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
um things like you know um red reflex
 
00:14:53.749 --> 00:14:53.759 align:start position:0%
examinations and a good opthalmologic
 
00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
examination you might pick up things
 
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
early on retinoblastoma glaucoma things
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
that could be corrected very early with
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
good success that if not treated up to
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
you know at the time of um when you
 
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
first could Discover it could lead to
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
potential problems down the road and
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
also then becomes a savings down the
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
road as we all know preventative care
 
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
tends to save you know um um significant
 
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%
dollars in monies in health care if we
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
can detect things early and treat them
 
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
in their more um in their early stages
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
so I guess my my thought was that there
 
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
may be some tightening up necessary as
 
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
we've all as we've talked about Rec
 
00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
right now but then my question would be
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
even if we did then get to you know some
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
tightened language you know whether it
 
00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
be a different terminology or qualified
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
provider that sort of thing it it still
 
00:15:52.309 --> 00:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
comes down to potentially a an impass of
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
the compulsory nature of the bill so I
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
guess that's where I would you know in
 
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
in in interim study may be the right way
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
to go but it still may also lead to the
 
00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:04.309 align:start position:0%
to go but it still may also lead to the
same

00:16:04.309 --> 00:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
conclusion I think it's going to lead
 
00:16:08.189 --> 00:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
conclusion and you raise a lot of good
 
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
points re of
 
00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:15.399 align:start position:0%
Murphy my thought is that it's really
 
00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
not a
 
00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
mandate it's is a mandate is something
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
in which you have no option to opt
 
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
out if you allow for the parent or the
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
guardian whoever it would
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.189 align:start position:0%
guardian whoever it would
be

00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
the ability to opt out of it then you
 
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
really don't have per se a mandate so
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
therefore as long as that is in the bill
 
00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:40.759 align:start position:0%
that the parent or Guardian has the
 
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
option to opt out I think I could live
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
with the issue of having the screening
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
being done it doesn't have to be done by
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
a school nurse who raise a good point
 
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
because minus standing and well child
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
visits that a lot of this is happening
 
00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
so if they have documentation that the
 
00:16:59.949 --> 00:16:59.959 align:start position:0%
physician the pediatrician has been
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
doing the screenings they don't have to
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel just bring a
 
00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:05.799 align:start position:0%
documentation from your physician that
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
they have had the screenings so
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
potentially so potentially then you
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
could you know again
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
philosophically um get over the um
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
mandate or compulsory nature hurdle by
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
basically saying in the language that
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
prior to any examination ocular you know
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
opthalmologic examination or screening
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
it has to have parental consent to do so
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
correct period
 
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
period that would
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
certainly that would certainly move me
 
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.310 align:start position:0%
certainly that would certainly move me
closer

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
closer
 
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
to I I I I don't want to I don't want to
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
say uh that it would move me all the way
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
to to supporting it there are a number
 
00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:45.640 align:start position:0%
of other things but I'm I'm going to
 
00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:48.039 align:start position:0%
agree with both of you wholeheartedly
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
that I think catching these problems
 
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
early can is not only beneficial in
 
00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
terms of the the cost that that it saves
 
00:17:59.230 --> 00:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
but also just the human suffering that
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
it saves so um so it certainly should be
 
00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.029 align:start position:0%
it saves so um so it certainly should be
encouraged

00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
encouraged
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
um the so let me let me tell you about
 
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
some other concerns I had as I was going
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
through the bill um and some of these I
 
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
think I put these as other issues in my
 
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
my notes here because I think most of
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
them are actually minor um minor and
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
easily fixed um one of them is as part
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
of the budget for the B
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
well the budget's already been passed so
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
that would just be a language change
 
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
that needs to happen um the commissioner
 
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
shall adopt rules um I always get
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
nervous when I see that we're
 
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
authorizing an agency to adopt
 
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
rules um just on General
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
principle um there is also a training
 
00:18:53.149 --> 00:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
requirement that would be established
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
under this bill and essentially it it
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
creates a sort of
 
00:19:04.149 --> 00:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
um list of approved providers and I this
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
isn't an objection so much as it's a
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
um are we potentially
 
00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
narrowing the the number of providers
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
who would be quote unquote authorized to
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
perform Vision screenings by by
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
including that in the bill I I would I
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
would say no only because I think
 
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
that as medicine has evolved over the
 
00:19:31.149 --> 00:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
years in my experience is that we have
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
expanded the scope of practice of and
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
even increased the U the variety of
 
00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:41.919 align:start position:0%
providers you know like uh Physical
 
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
Therapy 2 versus physical therapy one or
 
00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:47.240 align:start position:0%
LPNs you know in their their scope of
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
practice we've actually increased the
 
00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
number of titled or
 
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
named providers to do certain work in
 
00:19:57.789 --> 00:19:57.799 align:start position:0%
healthcare so if you have a training
 
00:19:57.799 --> 00:19:59.029 align:start position:0%
healthcare so if you have a training
program

00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
then that ties into what I said before
 
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
about don't list optometrist or
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
physician just say qualified provider
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
and that way if you have a pro you know
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
if you have a a requisite U training
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
program that ties into then the
 
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.549 align:start position:0%
program that ties into then the
qualified

00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:15.559 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
provider and so I so one of my other
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
objections or actually not objection
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
questions was about the list of specific
 
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
individuals you have you would be
 
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
addressing that question by just simply
 
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
saying qualified provider right um
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
um I now have to find this the section
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
specifically uh it's on the first page
 
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
bill um lines
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
18 I'm sorry 19
 
00:20:52.029 --> 00:20:52.039 align:start position:0%
2021 the department shall develop a list
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
of approved training
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
programs and then upon implementation
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
the the department shall provide a list
 
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
of qualified providers participating in
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
the State Medicaid Program to Primary
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
Care providers in the vision screening
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
initiative so
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
this kind of raises questions to me as
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
to who's who's on the list who's off the
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
list are we creating an additional
 
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
training requirement for providers who
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
may have been qualified all along and
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
may have been performing Vision
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
screenings all along but now we're
 
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
saying you got to go to the extra
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
training to be on the list and if you're
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
not on the list you can't be included in
 
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
this that's my sure I concur with you
 
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
okay well I I would push back only a
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
little bit saying that if if people have
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
been doing Vision screenings like if
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
they have done other exams in the school
 
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
setting but they weren't competent or
 
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
they weren't up to date with the
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
training protocols that are
 
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.430 align:start position:0%
training protocols that are
required

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
then I would say I don't think it's
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
going to exclude those that have already
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
done it my my I would be very surprised
 
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
to see anybody who's done this regularly
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
in the school setting not be able to
 
00:22:04.029 --> 00:22:04.039 align:start position:0%
take a simple qualific qualification
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
either exam or you know um certification
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
process to make sure that they are
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
qualified to do this
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it would eliminate
 
00:22:15.269 --> 00:22:15.279 align:start position:0%
anybody but I think having a training
 
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
program and then having a list that goes
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
to the public school systems would say
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
like when you're looking for a pharmacy
 
00:22:25.149 --> 00:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
you look on the list of CVS or Walgreens
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
or whatever and say there's one right
 
00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
there in Lebanon
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
I need somebody to do vision screening
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
or contract with them through the school
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
board or through the school itself who
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
in the region does that it would be a
 
00:22:38.669 --> 00:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
list so I think it would actually be
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
very helpful for a school system to know
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
who their vision screening providers are
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
um and I I think it would it would it
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
would just be very helpful in fact you
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
know it's easy to do because it's all
 
00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
electronic they have a list of them if
 
00:22:54.669 --> 00:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
you if you can do the vision screening
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
you're qualified you should be on a list
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
preferred provider meaning that you it
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
also would be good for Medicaid or any
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
insurance re reimbursement to know that
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
and they I think they do require it in
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
oftentimes other areas that if you are
 
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
you don't get reimbursed unless you are
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
specifically qualified to do a procedure
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
and or an exam so I I think for that
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
reason insurance reasons for Quality
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
reasons for ease of school systems
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
having a list of qualified providers
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful for many people I
 
00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
think the list is fine I think the
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
question is going to be how do you get
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
list right and and so I I think
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
philosophically we agree on it which is
 
00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
that you know anybody who is
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
legitimately qualified to do it ought
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
ought to be suitable to do
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
it being somewhat cynical I see things
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
more in terms of you know there's
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a uh a gatekeeper
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
saying I I want you to go through the
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
following training programs and it'll
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
cost you this much in time and money uh
 
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
to get on the list to do something that
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
you probably learned how to do years ago
 
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
and know full well how to do but I want
 
00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559 align:start position:0%
you on my list um and so I I'm my
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
concern is that we're creating that kind
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
of a a bureaucracy that I think is
 
00:24:18.669 --> 00:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
burdening to burdensome to to Medical
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
providers and um you know their time to
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
be better better spent caring for
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
patients again one push back that I
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
would give from my own experience is
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
that I was a board examiner for
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
orthopedic surgery I went out every July
 
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
for a week to reexamine it used to be in
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
the mid 80s that you once you were
 
00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
boarded you were grandfathered for Life
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is that you were
 
00:24:42.389 --> 00:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
grandfathered for life and that any new
 
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
techniques literature you didn't keep up
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
to date with because you weren't in in
 
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
in any way threatened to lose your board
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
certification but if you had but after
 
00:24:56.909 --> 00:24:56.919 align:start position:0%
87 or 88 I forget exactly the date we
 
00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
instituted research certification so
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
every 10 years you had to come back and
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
be recertified so it speaks to the fact
 
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
that yes somebody may have been doing
 
00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
this for a long period of time but they
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
aware of the new techniques or the new
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
ways to examine um and again it could be
 
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
just opthomology it could be any other
 
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
sub specially but again it makes sure
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
that people are up to dat and qualified
 
00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
to do the exam properly I think we're
 
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
completing a couple of things one is
 
00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
there's the
 
00:25:28.269 --> 00:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
screening which takes relatively minimal
 
00:25:31.149 --> 00:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
amount of training and there's also I
 
00:25:32.909 --> 00:25:32.919 align:start position:0%
exam so we're talking about screenings
 
00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:35.559 align:start position:0%
not exams right so if we stay at the
 
00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:37.799 align:start position:0%
screening side I think at that point in
 
00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
time is that what's involved to be
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
appropriately trained to do the
 
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
screening I think the exams is being
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
done by the appropriate professionals
 
00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
now optometrists and opthalmologists and
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
so forth so I don't think we're talking
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
about the exam here well I think that's
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
an important point to make because if
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
you are I wouldn't say only screening
 
00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
but if you are screening
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
only then you are picking up a deficit
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
in a child who can't see the chalkboard
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
or they are falling behind in their
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
reading um competency and therefore it
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
triggers a an exam by a real qualified
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
person who can do split lamp or any
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
other opthalmologic examination and so
 
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right we're talking
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
about screening not exam but they still
 
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
should be able to De demonstrate even
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
the minimal proficiency in screening I I
 
00:26:30.669 --> 00:26:30.679 align:start position:0%
concur I think that's where so I'm
 
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out though is what
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
level of training do they need to do the
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
screening I could give my wife a call
 
00:26:38.669 --> 00:26:38.679 align:start position:0%
and find out because she went through
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
the process even though she was a nurse
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
um to stay but I don't believe in
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
talking to her it was very difficult to
 
00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't even have to be a healthc
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
care professional in her opinion that
 
00:26:50.389 --> 00:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
does the screening it's just as long as
 
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
they're trained so so I think we're
 
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
actually all pretty much in agreement on
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
this which is that it's yeah it's it's
 
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
important to know that people are
 
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:01.799 align:start position:0%
qualified but not to make the process
 
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
burdensome and Mr chair if I could you
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
had two other things I don't see this as
 
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
having a fiscal not need one because if
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
I heard it correctly it's currently
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
being covered by
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and that's what the state
 
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
controls so therefore there's no impact
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
of the budget because we currently pay
 
00:27:18.909 --> 00:27:18.919 align:start position:0%
for it and number two I believe that's
 
00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
the case yes and number two I concur
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
with you I I'm really reluctant when you
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
talk about giving an agency rulle making
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
Authority unless it's very narrow in
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
scope mhm so that's where I'm coming
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
from so so the other so I'll I'll list a
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
couple of other things and again some of
 
00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:39.559 align:start position:0%
these are really minor and could be
 
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
fixed with small tweaks in language
 
00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:46.519 align:start position:0%
um the beginning of the bill says
 
00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:49.519 align:start position:0%
children ages 0 to
 
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
six the section 13 refers to children
 
00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.389 align:start position:0%
six the section 13 refers to children
under

00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:27:59.389 --> 00:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
six and so technically Al speaking does
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
are are those two the same thing or not
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
I think they're different I I think one
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
is zero through you know up to the day
 
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
before your seventh birthday and I think
 
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
the other one is um up until the day
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
before your sixth birthday uh I may be
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
wrong but that would be something I
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
would want clarification on
 
00:28:21.789 --> 00:28:21.799 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:23.549 align:start position:0%
um the the
section

00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:23.559 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
um there's a section that says every
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
child not reading at grade Lev by third
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
grade shall be referred uh by the school
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
physician or school
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
officials um I have to go look at it now
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
where are you um this is the
 
00:28:45.549 --> 00:28:45.559 align:start position:0%
last four thank you yeah it's it's page
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
18 of the second page of the bill uh
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
page three of the document special
 
00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
vision screening every child not reading
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
at grade level by third grade or at the
 
00:28:59.230 --> 00:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
request of their teacher shall be
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
referred by the school physician or
 
00:29:02.669 --> 00:29:02.679 align:start position:0%
School administrator to the parents or
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
Guardian for
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
examination and evaluation by a licensed
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
optometrist physician physician
 
00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:12.519 align:start position:0%
assistant or you know again we could say
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
provider at this point they're not
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
saying screening they're saying
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
examination now I can tell you having
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
served on a school board for three years
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
having served part of that time as the
 
00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
chair of the school board I have seen
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
multiple reports of where we are versus
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
grade level and there are a certain
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
percentage of students especially at the
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year who are not
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
reading at grade level um during coid
 
00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
this was especially true my concern is
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
we're we're triggering a process because
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
this is a shall be
 
00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.029 align:start position:0%
this is a shall be
referred

00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
referred
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
um when there may be clear knowable
 
00:29:58.509 --> 00:29:58.519 align:start position:0%
reasons why a child is otherwise not
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
reading at grade level um so I'm I'm
 
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
just a little bit concerned that this
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
is creating a creating a process that
 
00:30:10.269 --> 00:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
that may be completely unnecessary but
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
if we lay it out in statute we're
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
telling people they have to do it it
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
says shall so that that was another
 
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
concern finally uh I think this is my
 
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.710 align:start position:0%
concern finally uh I think this is my
last

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.509 align:start position:0%
last
one

00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:24.519 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:30:27.389 --> 00:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
um I have a question about as to whether
 
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
this is a 28a violation um
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
so um representative Murphy you referred
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
to sort of the school board Contracting
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
with uh providers and this was sort of I
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
I guess part of me kind of thought of it
 
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
this way as well is that um if the
 
00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
school is conducting the vision
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
screening either they're incurring some
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
kind of a training cost that they might
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
already be doing I don't know some but I
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
I suspect some may not not be to have a
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
school nurse or other other Personnel
 
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
trained in performing these Vision
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
screenings or they're Contracting with
 
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
an outside provider but there's a cost
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
associated with it potentially in any
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
case is that an unfunded mandate coming
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
down from the state on school districts
 
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
again that's a question it's a concern
 
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
about the current bill I don't know if
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
it's necessarily true um but I don't
 
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
know just going back to the previous
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
Point BAS basically this is sort of
 
00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.470 align:start position:0%
Point BAS basically this is sort of
saying

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
hey if if somebody's not reading at
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
third grade level it's not that we're
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
going to suggest a vision screening it's
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
that we're going to refer to the parent
 
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.310 align:start position:0%
that we're going to refer to the parent
or

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
guardian and we have to do it that they
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
will get an exam not a screening but a
 
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
full exam by a licensed uptop interest
 
00:31:53.629 --> 00:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
physician etc etc and so it it just
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
feels to me like all of these issues
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
isues collectively add up to a bill that
 
00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:03.559 align:start position:0%
needs a good deal more work than we
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
can can can do in in the next couple of
 
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
weeks um I I just feel like there's a
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
lot more that needs to happen with this
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
bill so that's that's kind of my my view
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
on it yeah and I I don't disagree with
 
00:32:18.509 --> 00:32:18.519 align:start position:0%
that I mean you when you're looking at
 
00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
that special screening vision screening
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
I I had some thoughts about that when I
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
was reading it again you know I I would
 
00:32:27.149 --> 00:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
keep the sh because it is still
 
00:32:30.269 --> 00:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
considered a uh an important Examination
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
for a child but it would be for not um
 
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
of said child for just evaluation by a
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
qualified provider um having said that
 
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that the unfunded mandate
 
00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.350 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that the unfunded mandate
for

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
a somebody who does the
 
00:32:50.909 --> 00:32:50.919 align:start position:0%
screenings the question I have in my
 
00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
mind oftentimes if you
 
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
are if you are willing to provide a
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
service in an institution whether it's a
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
school or a hospital you are responsible
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
personally for your own education for
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
your own certifications for your own
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
boards and the cost incurred by them
 
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
it's not usually picked up by somebody
 
00:33:13.149 --> 00:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
else you you you you're responsible
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
because in a sense you are uh providing
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
a surface under your license um and as
 
00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:23.919 align:start position:0%
such it could be an arrangement within
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
the school system that um the school
 
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
says yeah we're going to cover you know
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
that like many businesses cover you know
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
special training for their employees uh
 
00:33:37.629 --> 00:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
or it may be stated to the um to the
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
teacher or whomever in the school that
 
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
you can do the screenings but you're
 
00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
going to have to get the certification
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
on your own and you know so it doesn't
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
have to be necessarily a mandated
 
00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
funding it could be an arrangement that
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
is mutually agreed upon in every
 
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.430 align:start position:0%
is mutually agreed upon in every
institution

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
institution
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
um you know I have friends who have
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
businesses and up your Val and they
 
00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
don't always provide you know healthare
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
for their employees you know I mean
 
00:34:02.909 --> 00:34:02.919 align:start position:0%
that's up to them to decide you know
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
they get it or not uh but one of them
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
who is a plumber though he does not or
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
they do not provide Health Care they do
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
provide coverage for their special
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
training HVAC or whatever it might be
 
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
because they find that valuable to the
 
00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
business so I mean that could be not
 
00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:21.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily A unfunded mandate but it
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
may be an arrangement that is left to
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
the the school to say we will cover it
 
00:34:28.589 --> 00:34:28.599 align:start position:0%
or it's up to you to provide your
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
certification if you want to do it that
 
00:34:32.669 --> 00:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
sort of thing so
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
um again that's just off a couple
 
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
thoughts about when you mentioned that
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
before so okay and again for me it was
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
it was more of a question not a
 
00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:42.919 align:start position:0%
definitive statement because I I'm not
 
00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
sure whether it would be a 28a violation
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
yeah um any any other comments so you I
 
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
think you know you were said you were
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
doing a good deal of research as well
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
did you want to expand on that I think
 
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
part of what we're looking for if
 
00:35:04.109 --> 00:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
boiling it down I would say this bill
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
could be trimmed down
 
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
significantly um through through an
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
amendment now I don't know
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
TimeWise how much time we have do we
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
have to have an amendment ready when we
 
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
discuss this in exact session or do we
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
have the rest of the year to work on an
 
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
amendment to get it through the bill
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
through through the committee what's our
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
timeline does anyone know um
 
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
I believe November 17th is the signoff
 
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
date in other words I think it has to be
 
00:35:34.109 --> 00:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
out of
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
17th so I think that yeah bottom line we
 
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
would need to have an amendment to bring
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
to the full
 
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.309 align:start position:0%
to the full
committee

00:35:52.309 --> 00:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
um when the full committee meets to
 
00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
discuss this other stuff which means
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
that we would would presumably need to
 
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
have a an additional work session of
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
this group between now and then or we
 
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
could if it's okay with the chair not
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
know about representative Murphy I think
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of this will be tackle right
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
now through through our committee and
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
then bring an amendment to the exec
 
00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
committee for them to then at that point
 
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
in time with our recommendation to
 
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
support the amendment that we draft
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
providing agreement with the amendment
 
00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
and then at that point in time when we
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
have an ex session we could vote on the
 
00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
amendment at that time versus Heaven has
 
00:36:32.829 --> 00:36:32.839 align:start position:0%
come back to again work on the amendment
 
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
I think right now what I'm seeing is and
 
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing anyways with
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
some quick wording and so forth we could
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
take a a Microsoft Word of of this and
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
just parse
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
it I mean I think we have the concerns
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
that we've addressed I think we can work
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
on the language to get it through versus
 
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
I'm open to that discussion my biggest
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
concern is that I feel like there's a
 
00:37:12.309 --> 00:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
lot of potential problems here so
 
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
um it it feels to me like I I you you
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
believe that this it could be vastly
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
simplified I think vastly simplifying it
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
is is part of what needs to happen
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm just concerned that
 
00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:28.599 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of work to be I
 
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of work to be done
 
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
to come up with a workable Amendment but
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
that's you know if if the if if it's the
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
majority of this working group wants to
 
00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
proceed to try to craft an amendment
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
then you know by all means we can we can
 
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
route I think we take my my personal
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
opinion is take a Microsoft Word
 
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
document and probably take a
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
um aversion
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
to strike out I mean a lot of stuff here
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be here number one is
 
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid if you go to page
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
one line
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
six you don't have to fund a Medicaid
 
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
children's screening program unless
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about an unfunded mandate
 
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
we could cross that bridge later on so I
 
00:38:20.309 --> 00:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
don't see there's an issue with line six
 
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
quite frankly through 15 a lot of this
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
can just basically what trying to get to
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
is that the schools
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
shall provide the opportunity to a
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
child for a
 
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
screening and I I'm also wondering about
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not the 0 to six versus un
 
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
six is significant only because if they
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
cover it from 0 to 18 yeah then that age
 
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't really have any relevance does
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
it no I don't think so I I tend to agree
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
with you actually I think because it was
 
00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
sort of said we want to create a
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program for children ages Zer
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
to six and
 
00:39:02.829 --> 00:39:02.839 align:start position:0%
then but they cover all way to 18 right
 
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
so they they're they're all covering it
 
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
all all three plans are covering it as
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
an essential health benefit up to age 18
 
00:39:14.109 --> 00:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair if I just on page two on
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
line six following up with the prepos of
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
Murphy there shall be vision screening
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
by a qualified individual period yep let
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
me so so what I'm doing right now is
 
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
exporting the PDF to Word okay um so I
 
00:39:37.309 --> 00:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
have a Word
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
document and I'm going to turn on track
 
00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.309 align:start position:0%
document and I'm going to turn on track
changes

00:39:43.309 --> 00:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
um the first thing I'm gonna say is um
 
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
lines on the first page lines five
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
through 15 you can delete completely
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm actually I'm on the bill number
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
right now which is um
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
um a comment and and I don't I don't
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
believe that this can be changed in any
 
00:40:05.309 --> 00:40:05.319 align:start position:0%
way we cannot change the title but well
 
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
I think we can change the title I don't
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
think we can I've seen amendments that
 
00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:10.839 align:start position:0%
change the title we can't change the
 
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
bill number uh okay but the bill number
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
has an FN after
 
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
it and I would argue potentially it
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
should have an an L after it
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
well I think Finance could um redirect
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
it back to the committee if there's no
 
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal note okay so I'm just making a
 
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
note does it really need FN should it
 
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
have an L what's an L local meaning that
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
it has local an impact on local uh so if
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
you wanted to change the title or you
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
thought it was misleading title would
 
00:40:52.589 --> 00:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
you add just in front of um children's
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
just mandatory
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
um just
 
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
delete the last within the state of
 
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.950 align:start position:0%
delete the last within the state of
Medicaid

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
Program I I would I would not reference
 
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid because this bill really is not
 
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
about Medicaid I I don't see it as such
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
so I was just thinking establishing a
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
mandatory children's vision screening
 
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
initiative no not a
 
00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.230 align:start position:0%
initiative no not a
mandatory

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
well I I it it establishes what we've
 
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
been talking about that it is to some
 
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
degree well yeah you're right in the
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
sense that if they can opt out then it
 
00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:26.839 align:start position:0%
becomes not m
 
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
so okay would would Universal
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
work where are you or
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.349 --> 00:41:40.359 align:start position:0%
Statewide children's vision
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
screening requirement period that
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
works represent of Murphy what are your
 
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
thoughts yeah I'm okay with that yeah
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
yeah um actually I'm going to I'm going
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
to suggest a slight difference
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
establishing a Statewide children's
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
vision screening requirement for
 
00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
children in public
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
schools because that's what the bill
 
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
says does that um work I'm careful about
 
00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
the word requirement because it's
 
00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
mandate it seems to me it's an
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
initiative it's an
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
initiative or it's an initiative or
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
building Community
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
awareness what if you did title that you
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
just stated but instead of requirement
 
00:42:27.069 --> 00:42:27.079 align:start position:0%
just initiative How would
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
establishing a Statewide children's
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
vision screening Initiative for
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
children entering Public Schools
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
sure in public school in public school
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
and I would say for those who are being
 
00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:41.559 align:start position:0%
homeschooled why could not the parent
 
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
nurse there's no reason why they could
 
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
primary care or somebody like that well
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
again you're you're expanding
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
the scope of the Bild then
 
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
and what what I'm concerned about is
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
that we then have a cohort of children
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
outside of the school system that can
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
actually participate in school sports
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
they can participate in school
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
activities so why would they not allow
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
them to go to a screening if the parent
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
that I guess my I I'll just be blunt uh
 
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
do does it complicate the bill to start
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
bringing those things into it I I would
 
00:43:38.349 --> 00:43:38.359 align:start position:0%
say it's a question of how we word it
 
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
okay so again the same thing I'm I'm
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
more into looking at this if you want to
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
make it really Statewide then once we
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
start parsing out and saying well these
 
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
children don't need to be considered
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
because they're in private school they
 
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
don't have to be considered because
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
they're homeschooled they're in a
 
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
religious school then all of a sudden
 
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
the broad initiative of taking care of
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
our children fundamentally
 
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
philosophically goes away okay I'm going
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
to say I think it it complicates it it
 
00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
it it makes the
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
um I think there will be more objections
 
00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:14.559 align:start position:0%
if if it is then take it
 
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
out um or leave out the word Public
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
School in the title at
 
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
least great I'll remove in public
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
schools School establishing Statewide
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
children's vision screening Initiative
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
for children uh children at school age
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
I'm yeah
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
um establishing a
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
Statewide vision screening get rid of
 
00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
children's I had children in there twice
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
yeah um establishing a Statewide vision
 
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
screening Initiative for school age
 
00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.349 align:start position:0%
screening Initiative for school age
children

00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:44:48.359 --> 00:44:49.990 align:start position:0%
children
yes

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
okay under
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
um yes so school age though yeah that
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
that doesn't cover the neonate or the
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
good point 0 to3 so um in in practice
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
neither does the bill no right but what
 
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
about just saying just stopping that
 
00:45:08.589 --> 00:45:08.599 align:start position:0%
title at we can take it out of the title
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
yeah it's fine with me okay
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
um so I just took it out with the title
 
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
um analysis this bill establishes a
 
00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
children's vision screening initiative
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
administered by the Department of Health
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
and Human
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
Services period done period
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
yeah where where were you now this is
 
00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
analysis okay thank you I don't think
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
you need a second sentence at all right
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.549 --> 00:45:43.559 align:start position:0%
um then we get down to enact
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
establishing etc etc in this case I'm
 
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
going to replace it with the title that
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.880 --> 00:46:04.910 align:start position:0%
 
earlier

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:10.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
um so to help with the next paragraph
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
there because it has a lot of stuff in
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
there we would want to eliminate
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
potentially how about just as I'm
 
00:46:20.829 --> 00:46:20.839 align:start position:0%
reading this the you can just use the
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
words here and eliminate parts of it the
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
shall uh provide now you go down four
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
lines shall provide vision screening
 
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
services to Children um
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
um to
 
00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
Program from0 to 18 would you have would
 
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
you want have that more specific like
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
that so the Department of Health and
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
Human Services shall provide vision
 
00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
screening oh but they're not provided no
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
no no so um that's right it should they
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
shall um
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
establish vision screening
 
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:10.839 align:start position:0%
um Initiative for children between ages
 
00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:12.839 align:start position:0%
zero and 18 I would think that that's
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
all encompassing obviously right that's
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about
 
00:47:20.349 --> 00:47:20.359 align:start position:0%
umun to me let me ask a question for a
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
moment if let's just skip down
 
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
to the next page page Tech uh line
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
pupils there shall be a vision screening
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
by a
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
qualified provider provider yep uh etc
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
etc does does
 
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
that does that address the fundamental
 
00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
requirement because if
 
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
if the the the beginning of the bill
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
basically basally says the Department of
 
00:47:58.829 --> 00:47:58.839 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services shall seek
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
funding they shall get this you know as
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
part of the State Medicaid Program and
 
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
uh they should make they you know there
 
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
should be a a complete training program
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
available and um the commissioner shall
 
00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:13.710 align:start position:0%
available and um the commissioner shall
adopt

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:13.720 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
00:48:16.829 --> 00:48:16.839 align:start position:0%
rules uh governing the administration of
 
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
the of the
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
initiative um including eligible
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
criteria frequency and type there's a
 
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
whole lot here that and and this is
 
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
again why I'm I'm concerned like can we
 
00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
really accomplish this if we're doing
 
00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:32.910 align:start position:0%
really accomplish this if we're doing
this

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
amendment what are we ask I mean what is
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
the do does HHS have any role in this um
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
I think so I'm just not totally clear on
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
what it is and we don't have anybody
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
from HHS here to provide that input so
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
this is where I'm I'm kind of concerned
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
that we're we're trying to do major
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
surgery on this bill and it just feels
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
like like there's too much and and so
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
having said that I I guess I feel like
 
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
the the the need of the bill is really
 
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
that second page starting on line
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
six Mr chair yes I think if we go back
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
and look at line six and what represent
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
Murphy talked about is a qualified
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
provider MH and then you can take the
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
rest of that and delete it results of
 
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
children's vision screening shall be
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
presented to the local school board I
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
think at this point in time the
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate place to send it is not the
 
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:31.160 align:start position:0%
school board but the
 
00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.170 align:start position:0%
school board but the
parents

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:32.180 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:33.470 align:start position:0%
parents
[Music]

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:49:37.549 --> 00:49:37.559 align:start position:0%
um so it's basically on line nine result
 
00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:39.319 align:start position:0%
of the children's vision screening shall
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
be presented to the guardian or the
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
parent of the child could it be an
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
and and local school offici and then all
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
and also local school board I mean but
 
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
the school board I it's interesting
 
00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:54.839 align:start position:0%
because when I first read that I
 
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
commented it
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
the school board does not want to or
 
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
need to know about specific health
 
00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:03.400 align:start position:0%
conditions of specific individuals and
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
then I reread it and I said okay I don't
 
00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
know how I saw School Board in that
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
because school board is not in that
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
sentence correct um it says school
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
officials so just a a sort of a point of
 
00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
of order on that particular sentence
 
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
um so well and to the local school
 
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
officials on a form provided by the
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
local school
 
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
authorities do we in fact want it to be
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
a different form for every potentially a
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
different form for every school district
 
00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
in the state now presumably the New
 
00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:37.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
could could publish a form and say hey
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
use this or the school Nurses
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
Association could do the same thing but
 
00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
practically speaking do we want to do we
 
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
want a potentially a proliferation of
 
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
different kinds of
 
00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
forms as a provider I think you would
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
want want to know that there's one form
 
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
that you use right then you get back
 
00:51:02.789 --> 00:51:02.799 align:start position:0%
into who's going to create the
 
00:51:07.789 --> 00:51:07.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:10.839 align:start position:0%
HHS you could yeah DHHS could create a
 
00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
form standardized form to utilize but
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
that's going to go through rule making
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:26.069 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
or you could I mean part of but looking
 
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
at I think
 
00:51:36.789 --> 00:51:36.799 align:start position:0%
the the CR the critical piece to this is
 
00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:38.839 align:start position:0%
being sure that parents know what the
 
00:51:38.839 --> 00:51:40.030 align:start position:0%
being sure that parents know what the
results

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
results
 
00:51:42.789 --> 00:51:42.799 align:start position:0%
were and and at the same time when they
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
pres present the results what their
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
options are to deal with the
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
results was presented to their the
 
00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
guardian and to local school officials
 
00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
correct Guardian parent or school right
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
and local
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
officials because the form could be
 
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
created by HHS and placed in the um the
 
00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
paragraph Roman jeel two up above there
 
00:52:09.069 --> 00:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
basically you can do that yeah a form
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
right now the other thing which I would
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
say is that based upon what I saw in the
 
00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
screenings the document I sent to you
 
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
folks or to myself
 
00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:35.799 align:start position:0%
is how often you know if you come in on
 
00:52:35.799 --> 00:52:37.309 align:start position:0%
is how often you know if you come in on
grade

00:52:37.309 --> 00:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
grade
 
00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
screening I look at representative
 
00:52:46.829 --> 00:52:46.839 align:start position:0%
Murphy um I've been told that sometimes
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
in some schools it's K grade one grade
 
00:52:51.789 --> 00:52:51.799 align:start position:0%
two and then it goes to four and so
 
00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:54.200 align:start position:0%
forth so the question is even though
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
they failed or pass the first one at
 
00:52:59.950 --> 00:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
kindergarten should they have one again
 
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:01.240 align:start position:0%
when they get the first grade I mean how
 
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
often do you have to do a screening
 
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
have or do leave it up to the local
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
school officials to determine the
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
frequency which the screening is done
 
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
well again in paragraph you know
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph Roman two you could basically
 
00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
be another sentence that basically just
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
says um you know because they referen
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
the American Academy of Pediatrics they
 
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
the recommendation as to the U frequency
 
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.829 align:start position:0%
the recommendation as to the U frequency
of

00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
exams as determined by the American
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
opthalmologic Association and the um
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
Academy of Pediatrics that that works
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
yeah because that could change over time
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
will okay I'm trying to keep up with and
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
I'm and I'd like to kind of go through
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
this methodically if possible um and I
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
apologize because I'm struggling a
 
00:53:58.430 --> 00:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
little bit with the way this exported to
 
00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
word and the formatting is going to be
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
odd but I I I think I've got it under
 
00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
um what I have at the top is the
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:23.230 align:start position:0%
 
initiative

00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
um what did we say before for for
 
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
18 okay
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna strike the seek funding
 
00:54:51.319 --> 00:54:53.270 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna strike the seek funding
for

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid as part of this Department's
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
budget for the bium ending June 30th
 
00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
2025 and each B bium
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
thereafter then we've got the program
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
shall provide reim well actually it's
 
00:55:07.789 --> 00:55:07.799 align:start position:0%
we're not doing reimbursements either
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
um that sentence that said Department of
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
shall provide um vision screening you
 
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
know the first sentence here vision
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
screening services children between zero
 
00:55:28.829 --> 00:55:28.839 align:start position:0%
and 18 years of age
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
um uh by qualified providers that
 
00:55:33.789 --> 00:55:33.799 align:start position:0%
encompasses everybody all that all that
 
00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:36.839 align:start position:0%
sentence I would think screening by
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
qualified providers yeah I I don't even
 
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
think we need to say by qualified
 
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
providers at this point I think we say
 
00:55:45.029 --> 00:55:45.039 align:start position:0%
that later and I think this
 
00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:48.039 align:start position:0%
is Introduction my my concern is I don't
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
want to say the Department of Health and
 
00:55:53.029 --> 00:55:53.039 align:start position:0%
Human Services shall provide Visions
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's they're going to establish the
 
00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.829 align:start position:0%
it's they're going to establish the
initiative

00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
00:55:58.510 --> 00:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
or program call it what you will but
 
00:55:59.710 --> 00:55:59.720 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be the ones
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
actually providing the screenings so I'm
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about using the word provide
 
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
yeah shall provide right um establish
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
um vision screening Initiative for
 
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
children vision screening services
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
Initiative for children between Z and 18
 
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
then we get again starting and and I'm
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
I've completely lost track of line
 
00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
numbers but provide I think it's line 11
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
providers who choose to participate in
 
00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:41.829 align:start position:0%
providers who choose to participate in
the

00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
program and this kind of gets us back to
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
you know the is is is a position
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
who's qualified to to do a vision
 
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
screening but but hasn't
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
taken the initiative to to opt
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
in not qualified to do division
 
00:57:04.589 --> 00:57:04.599 align:start position:0%
screening Mr chair yes instead of trying
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
to modify this which is going to be
 
00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
problematic would it be better for us to
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
have a clean slate and have an amendment
 
00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:13.470 align:start position:0%
have a clean slate and have an amendment
replace

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
replace
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
all can you start over yes I I I think
 
00:57:20.109 --> 00:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
that that that's what it's looking like
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
and again this is this is where I I'm
 
00:57:25.789 --> 00:57:25.799 align:start position:0%
concerned that we're we're really
 
00:57:27.309 --> 00:57:27.319 align:start position:0%
we're deciding to write a bill from
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
scratch essent essentially and there's a
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
lot there's a lot to consider here
 
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to clean up here and
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
of input from stakeholders that I think
 
00:57:43.029 --> 00:57:43.039 align:start position:0%
we need and aren't aren't in a position
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
to take unless we have another meeting
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
and we cannot do that meeting via
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
virtual meeting is that correct we we
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
cannot do it virtually
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
um we would have to get we would have to
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
request an amendment from ol we
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
certainly can do that I know that they
 
00:58:00.359 --> 00:58:02.150 align:start position:0%
certainly can do that I know that they
are

00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
um under a lot of pressure right now we
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
have over 800 house bills we have 300
 
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
and some odd I 312 Senate bills
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
um and they have a
 
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.549 --> 00:58:23.559 align:start position:0%
so yeah I mean my concern is that we're
 
00:58:27.069 --> 00:58:27.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
we're to me this feels like an interim
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
study bill I have I got to be honest
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
with you it feels to me like we're we're
 
00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
performing major surgery on it and and
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
that it it makes me uncomfortable I
 
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with you there because it
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're trying to Wordsmith
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
this to the point where we're going to
 
00:58:44.589 --> 00:58:44.599 align:start position:0%
be satisfied I'm concerned that we'll
 
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
get to the end of this short meeting and
 
00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:48.440 align:start position:0%
still not have a product that will
 
00:58:51.789 --> 00:58:51.799 align:start position:0%
really all that comfortable with Z right
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
and and that we we should expect a bunch
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
of fresh input from stakeholders
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
including DHHS and the New Hampshire um
 
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
optometrist Association and others
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
um that have not I mean what they've
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
been looking at is a very very different
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
Bill than what we will be ultimately
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
looking at I don't think it's a non-
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
gerine Amendment situation in other
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
words I don't think we're compelled to
 
00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
hold another hearing but practically
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
speaking I I don't think it makes sense
 
00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
to move move forward
 
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
legislation where we have not provided
 
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
an opportunity if we're making changes
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
that major where we have not provided an
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity for people to to voice their
 
00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:39.319 align:start position:0%
support or opposition or concerns and I
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
I you know I I've been listening in
 
00:59:44.349 --> 00:59:44.359 align:start position:0%
participating but I I've also come to
 
00:59:46.109 --> 00:59:46.119 align:start position:0%
the same agreement or conclusion in my
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
mind that I'm not sure right now we can
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
make it satisfactory number one number
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
two there may be other people that would
 
00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559 align:start position:0%
want to participate and again it's that
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
0 to 18 is it all children 0 to 18 or is
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
it the the ones that are homeschooled or
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
whatever um what would you know the rul
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
making Authority for them to come up
 
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
with the rules that were assigning to
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
HHS so I don't disagree I don't want to
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
kill the bill because I think it's an
 
01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
don't I think it's important um I think
 
01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.430 align:start position:0%
don't I think it's important um I think
this

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
if we do interim study we're not going
 
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
to get something for at least another
 
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
year so so let me let me
 
01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
offer that's all an Al an alternate yeah
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
suggestion and I still think we
 
01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:43.640 align:start position:0%
need stakeholder input on
 
01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
this so I'm going to read you RSA
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
200 section 32 it's not very
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
long and you'll you'll recognize I some
 
01:00:56.349 --> 01:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
language physical examination of pupils
 
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:00.839 align:start position:0%
there shall be a complete physical
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
examination by a licensed physician
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
physician assistant or advanced practice
 
01:01:08.109 --> 01:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
registered nurse of each child prior to
 
01:01:10.029 --> 01:01:10.039 align:start position:0%
or upon first entry into the public
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
school system and thereafter as often as
 
01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
deemed necessary by the local school
 
01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:17.240 align:start position:0%
Authority the result of the child's
 
01:01:19.029 --> 01:01:19.039 align:start position:0%
physical examination shall be presented
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
to the local school officials on a form
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
provided by the local school authorities
 
01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
no physical examination shall be
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
required of a child whose parent or
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
Guardian objects thet in writing on the
 
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
grounds that such physical examination
 
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
is contrary to the child's religious
 
01:01:37.549 --> 01:01:37.559 align:start position:0%
tenants or and
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
teachings that is short it is
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
simple um I don't necessarily
 
01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:47.720 align:start position:0%
like everything about it but it's short
 
01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
01:01:48.599 --> 01:01:50.230 align:start position:0%
and it's
simple

01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
simple
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
um is that current law that is current
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
law rsa2 200 section 32 and again a lot
 
01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
of the language in House Bill 580 or not
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
a lot but some some of the language in
 
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill 580 is clearly drawn from
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
this section so it's uh
 
01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
200 section
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:23.349 align:start position:0%
 
sanitation

01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
sanitation
 
01:02:23.359 --> 01:02:25.750 align:start position:0%
sanitation
and

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
the house bill 580 does not propose to
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
amend that section what it proposes is
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
to insert a section after that
 
01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:41.109 align:start position:0%
to insert a section after that
section

01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
so what why are we going through all of
 
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:45.640 align:start position:0%
this if it's already
 
01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
there this says complete physical
 
01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
examination so and and the the the bill
 
01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
is aimed specifically at
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
vision screening and I think it's also
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
the younger child too right because that
 
01:03:04.029 --> 01:03:04.039 align:start position:0%
says before school right well no it's
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
the it's actually the same language it's
 
01:03:08.029 --> 01:03:08.039 align:start position:0%
upon first entry into the public school
 
01:03:09.789 --> 01:03:09.799 align:start position:0%
system and thereafter but what that
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
excludes is a neonate or that zero to
 
01:03:14.029 --> 01:03:14.039 align:start position:0%
three right and I think what there this
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
bill also does is expand it to that
 
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
early you know childhood neonate to
 
01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
three years old or four years old when
 
01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:25.240 align:start position:0%
they enter school so well but
 
01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.269 align:start position:0%
they enter school so well but
practically

01:03:27.269 --> 01:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
practically
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
speaking it it that that's where I say
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
the the current bill is kind of
 
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
confusing because it it it goes into
 
01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and that we want to establish a
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid vision screening program for
 
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
ages 0 to six and then it
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
says essentially the same language we
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
see here except instead of physical
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
examination it says vision
 
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
screening and it says up to age six
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
which excludes a child who may be
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
entering you know maybe turning six in
 
01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
September in the middle of September of
 
01:04:08.029 --> 01:04:08.039 align:start position:0%
the year that they enter first grade or
 
01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
it could be a child who who's who's
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
coming in from another state and they're
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
nine years old and they haven't had that
 
01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
vision screening so the the way it's
 
01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
written currently
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
is confusing contradictory Etc I I guess
 
01:04:29.069 --> 01:04:29.079 align:start position:0%
I'm suggesting that if if you wanted a
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
path to I mean it sounds like the
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
fundamental concern here
 
01:04:34.799 --> 01:04:36.910 align:start position:0%
fundamental concern here
is

01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
that we would like kids to to get this
 
01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
we want parents to be aware of it we
 
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
want parents to have a choice to opt
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
out but and so so so that we can
 
01:04:51.269 --> 01:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
catch these kinds of problems
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
early um it's it's it's interesting in
 
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
the letter from the New
 
01:05:01.269 --> 01:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Optometric
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
Association they note that you know
 
01:05:07.269 --> 01:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
because of the definition of vision care
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
as an essential benefit under the
 
01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.430 align:start position:0%
as an essential benefit under the
ACA

01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
ACA
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
um they they say you know we're we're
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
happy that that you know that's now
 
01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
available to families however it is not
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
being utilized um in other words not
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
being fully
 
01:05:29.789 --> 01:05:29.799 align:start position:0%
utilized um any such any program created
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
by HB 580 should supplement and not
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
detract from or delay the utilization of
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
existing annual comprehensive eye exam
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
benefit um so if I could interject right
 
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
here so what what I'm hearing then as I
 
01:05:45.549 --> 01:05:45.559 align:start position:0%
look at this it says also so this bill
 
01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me then came about to fund
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
because the first sentence is HHS shall
 
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
seek funding from Medicaid but that
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
funding is already existent and so
 
01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
therefore if if we're targeting then a
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
group before they get into school but we
 
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
would also like to have it be that that
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
group from zero to when they enter
 
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
School whether that's four five or six
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
then if there's a mandate who is the
 
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
Mandate placed upon is it the parents
 
01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
because they're not already in the
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
school system right so it seems to me
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
this bill was initiated to seek funding
 
01:06:25.470 --> 01:06:25.480 align:start position:0%
from Medicaid that was already present
 
01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
for 0 to six but
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
then where I'm getting confused with
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
this versus what's already in statute is
 
01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
the necessity of this bill if it's
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
already funded and if it's trying to
 
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
create a mandate of examination from
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
zero to six or when they enter School
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
who's the Mandate on at that point
 
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
because it's not the school they're not
 
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
in school yet is it the parents is it
 
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
it's the parents yeah right um so so so
 
01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
and and it's a I mean let's be honest
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
it's a low bar I mean it it's anybody
 
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
almost everybody who has a um almost
 
01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
everybody who has health insurance or if
 
01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
they have Medicaid uh in New
 
01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's not going to cost them
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
anything out of pocket there are some
 
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
and if if we if we were to remove the
 
01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
the language around um you know you can
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
object for any reason not just for
 
01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
religious reasons then
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
I think we're we're pretty much covered
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
my I guess
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
my I'm still going to say I think that
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
interim study is is the way to go with
 
01:07:35.269 --> 01:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
this because I think there are so many
 
01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
un unanswered questions having said that
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
I will offer a suggestion I don't know
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
that I will necessarily support this
 
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion but it's it's I want to throw
 
01:07:47.069 --> 01:07:47.079 align:start position:0%
out the idea anyway which is if we look
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
at RSA 200 section
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
32 um we could potentially boil down the
 
01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
intent that we're talking about here to
 
01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.990 align:start position:0%
intent that we're talking about here to
Simply

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
Simply
 
01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
adding a few words to this section or
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
more or less duplicating this section
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
and replace physical examination with
 
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
vision screening um you know the the the
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
the the first version would be there
 
01:08:15.069 --> 01:08:15.079 align:start position:0%
shall be a complete physical examination
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
comma including vision screening comma
 
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
um and the the the second version would
 
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
be copy and paste this whole thing and
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
replace physical examination with vision
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
screening I still you know I I'm not
 
01:08:31.709 --> 01:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
crazy about the contrary to the child's
 
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
religious tenants and teachings I prefer
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
your version which is unless the parent
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
objects period
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
um so that that would be the really
 
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
simple way I think to get to where we
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm hearing in terms of
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
intent I think as we listen to this
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
conversation I'm beginning to understand
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
where the
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
ey Physicians are coming up with some
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
sort of an an objection because the way
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
I read this
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
now the child's required to get a
 
01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
complete physical eye
 
01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
exam which is done by one of the
 
01:09:11.789 --> 01:09:11.799 align:start position:0%
providers if we allow for a screening in
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
addition to the physical exam I think
 
01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
their concern is that parents won't go
 
01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
to the ey doctor for the exam and rely
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
upon the screening itself that's one
 
01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
issue yes number two there's no funding
 
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
in Medicaid for a vision screening it's
 
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
only for the exam so I think what
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
they're trying to do is create a funding
 
01:09:35.789 --> 01:09:35.799 align:start position:0%
mechanism for those who do a screening
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
so that they would not have an unfunded
 
01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
mandate that's kind of what I'm boiling
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
it down to and I
 
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
think if we go back to the bill and just
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
look at 20 col
 
01:09:54.669 --> 01:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
32 and work on that piece of of it and
 
01:09:56.669 --> 01:09:56.679 align:start position:0%
leave everything else out of
 
01:09:58.750 --> 01:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
it I think we're going the right
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
direction we don't need the rest of it's
 
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with a funding
 
01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
mechanism for screenings with Medicaid
 
01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:06.679 align:start position:0%
and so forth Etc because that's where
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
the state has any control over it I
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
don't think we have to worry about
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
funding the screenings per se although
 
01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
it could be a 28a violation that I don't
 
01:10:19.149 --> 01:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
know um but for the most part schools
 
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
are probably doing most of this anyways
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
and I think where the eye doctors are
 
01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
concerned about is that because if we
 
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
weaken this language in the current
 
01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
statute then their concern would be that
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
parents won't go to the eye doctor for
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
the physical exam they'll rely upon the
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
screening which is not a bad thing so
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
are you saying that the examination is
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
covered by Medicaid but screenings are
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
not right so is that an entirely
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
different conversation then that to to
 
01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
is it trying to then establish funding
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid or just children's vision
 
01:10:59.070 --> 01:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
screening number one and my sense would
 
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
be the opthalmologists want to decrease
 
01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how to capture this in
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
a bill they want to decrease the time
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
from uh exam to referral so you know
 
01:11:12.149 --> 01:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
what they're saying is we want to catch
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
this these this pathology early you know
 
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
but how do you do that if a child is not
 
01:11:21.149 --> 01:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
already in school right I mean yeah how
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
are you going to do that how do you
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
mandate that I'm not sure how you do
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
that isn't that part of the Wild Child
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
visit it it it should be
 
01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
so but if is it done by people that are
 
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
qualified to do it number one number two
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
is it reimbursed for them to do that
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
screening I and that's where I'm going
 
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
to push back a little bit with the
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
represent of Murphy is that right now
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
you have a physician doesn't say what
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
physician it could be a pathologist most
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
likely not but it could be you could
 
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
have a PA you could have a nurse
 
01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
practitioner who have have not the
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate training to do it an eye
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
exam but according to the law they can
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
do it mhm and I think it's back to my
 
01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
concern is that as you mentioned before
 
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
it's a qualified
 
01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
provider not just a provider with a
 
01:12:12.189 --> 01:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
license so the the way I'm hearing it
 
01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:14.679 align:start position:0%
again is that this bill seems to me as
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's written now and the intent was to
 
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
do two things maybe more but um to
 
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
provide funding for screening number one
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
one which may not be done right now
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
number two is to decrease the time
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
between you know the onset of pathology
 
01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
the exam and then the referral meaning
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
how do you pick up the very young child
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
I think so and having said that I'm not
 
01:12:41.709 --> 01:12:41.719 align:start position:0%
sure we can right now
 
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
then rewrite this whole bill you know to
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
concerns that's why you know it may be
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
as I go around the barn with this that
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
interim study may be the more
 
01:12:58.270 --> 01:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to proceed with it I
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
think we're probably coming to the same
 
01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
conclusion I would say the First full
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
page of this bill could be deleted
 
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
completely the only place I see a lot of
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
Merit here is on the second page
 
01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
starting with section three which is the
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
screening or vision screening of pupils
 
01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
and pups me and I is not students so I
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
think that's kind of the Cor of the
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
whole thing is that
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
section I think the lines 18 to
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
25 um getting down to third grade and so
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
forth and trying to be sure it should be
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
done I think if you go back to looking
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
that with the frequency in which
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
screenings are accomplished that would
 
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
be picked up at that time anyways but I
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
think the real heart of what we're
 
01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
trying to get to is on page two line six
 
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
through 15 the rest of it we could
 
01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.030 align:start position:0%
through 15 the rest of it we could
jettison

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
jettison
 
01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
and that's why I said that I I think the
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
the essence of what we're talking about
 
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
is is really
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
taking 200 R RSA 200 section 32 yep and
 
01:14:11.149 --> 01:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
creating a more or less a duplicate copy
 
01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
of that in the form of RSA
 
01:14:19.629 --> 01:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
232a um or just adding you know adding
 
01:14:21.629 --> 01:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
vision screening to to the existing
 
01:14:23.629 --> 01:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
statute although the exist existing
 
01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
statute is Under The Heading
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
um health and I'd have to go look at it
 
01:14:30.239 --> 01:14:34.510 align:start position:0%
um health and I'd have to go look at it
but

01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
um I I I still feel like we are
 
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
operating with incomp well I feel like
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
I'm operating with incomplete
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
information because I I was given to
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
understand that under
 
01:14:51.709 --> 01:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
Medicaid vision care generally speak
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
broadly speaking is is covered so I may
 
01:14:56.110 --> 01:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
be wrong about that but the screening
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
are not okay so you're you're sure of
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for it being is that
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
in the school system talk to my wife was
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
a school nurse they can build Medicaid
 
01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
for certain services this is not one of
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
them okay so that's that's four five
 
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
years ago so it may have changed but
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's okay so that kind of gets us back
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
to you know is the int is the is the
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
original Bill than creating a new
 
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program or Medicaid um coverage
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
for vision
 
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
screenings necessary if you wanted to
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
implement that limited section that that
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
you just
 
01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
identified I don't think so because most
 
01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
schools today do hearing en Vision
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
screenings so it's it's there the
 
01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
question comes down to is how often
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
are the parents aware of it and that's
 
01:15:59.310 --> 01:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
part of I think this is more of a
 
01:16:01.709 --> 01:16:01.719 align:start position:0%
communication education issue is
 
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
building awareness of what can be done
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
by the school nurse as a screening
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
process and as long as we allow for the
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
parent to opt out which we do with the
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
other dental and so forth then at that
 
01:16:17.229 --> 01:16:17.239 align:start position:0%
point in time the parent has to give
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
their explicit permission to do the
 
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:25.070 align:start position:0%
their explicit permission to do the
screening

01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
screening
 
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
so I have a procedural question and I'm
 
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
not I think you're you're the most
 
01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
likely with the longest tenure here in
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature you're the most likely
 
01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
to know the answer if we go interim
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
study does that preclude us from acting
 
01:16:45.229 --> 01:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
on the Legislation during this bium
 
01:16:45.239 --> 01:16:48.550 align:start position:0%
on the Legislation during this bium
yes

01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
okay one of the things I could suggest
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
is that this is going to come out of the
 
01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
the house it's going to go to the other
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
side of the wall and it's going to have
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
a full hearing on that side of the wall
 
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
so I do hear the concerns by the chair
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
about having other people weigh in on
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
this and it's a very logical wise
 
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
concern but be mindful the fact is even
 
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
no matter what we do
 
01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
here it's going over to the other
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
chamber and it's going to have a full
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
hearing and everyone including
 
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
DHHS um the opthalmologist optometrist
 
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
school boards are going to weigh on it
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
so they'll have another bite at the
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
Apple yeah and I'm going to argue that
 
01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
unless it's waved by Finance it's also
 
01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
going to go through Finance correct um
 
01:17:37.709 --> 01:17:37.719 align:start position:0%
so and and having said that I generally
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
like to take the position that I don't
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
want to act on a bill I I always want to
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
act on a bill as if you know my decision
 
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
is is ultimately the one that will that
 
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
will prevail and um not depend on
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
someone else to fix something and so I I
 
01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:57.639 align:start position:0%
I totally get what you're saying um
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I want to ask
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
if you know where what's the what's the
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
will of the committee regarding interim
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
study versus an amendment and if it's an
 
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
amendment do you have a suggestion as to
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
what that would look
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
like I
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
yes I do have a suggestion about the
 
01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
amendment um I would focus on the
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
amendment on line six
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
through 15 on page two and everything
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
else I would probably
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
jettison as far as another bite at the
 
01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
Apple you're right I'd like to have
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
things come out based upon doing it
 
01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
correctly not relying upon other people
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
to do it now the option to an amendment
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
is going to interim
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
study which means is is going to be dead
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
for this year and we're going to have to
 
01:18:59.070 --> 01:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
rely upon the next legislative body to
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
pick up the bill if someone even wants
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
to do it because it's going to have to
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
vium so and representative Murphy so
 
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
what I was thinking about because I was
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
looking at that and I agree that that's
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
already in statute colon
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
32A that could be changed obviously to
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
to disqualified providers but it still
 
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
gets to the um child prior to or upon
 
01:19:31.229 --> 01:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
entry into public school
 
01:19:31.239 --> 01:19:33.870 align:start position:0%
entry into public school
system

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
and so the two things that I think we
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that this resolves is the
 
01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid funding for screening number
 
01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
one and number two the the how do you
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
pick up the
 
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
child before they get to school age you
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
know before they get to school so and I
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
I think I think when this bill was
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
probably written the intent because they
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
put 0 to six was specifically to get to
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
that younger child in some way or manner
 
01:20:05.709 --> 01:20:05.719 align:start position:0%
to um have a screening done um they
 
01:20:07.229 --> 01:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
probably knew that there was no funding
 
01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
for screening so I suspect that funding
 
01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
should be if we're going to do this
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
would be part of the bill but number
 
01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
two in to me it's how do you get how do
 
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
you get the examination of that very
 
01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
young child done
 
01:20:27.709 --> 01:20:27.719 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think just simply having a
 
01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement you know carrot will
 
01:20:32.350 --> 01:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily always get it done for the
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
child for every child I totally agree I
 
01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
think until they get to school or get
 
01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
into you know prek or k some level of
 
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
school there's no gatekeeper if you will
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
right to be sure the parent is doing
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
what we think they should be doing so in
 
01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
in that we cannot mandate the no parents
 
01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
activity then perhaps the simplest way
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
in head in in medicine would be
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
therefore if you provide Medicaid
 
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
funding for
 
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
screening would that then be enough of
 
01:21:09.550 --> 01:21:09.560 align:start position:0%
an initiative to have um screenings done
 
01:21:12.430 --> 01:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
by qualified providers um I'm not sure
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
about that I don't know if that's going
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
to encourage the parent to get to a
 
01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
provider um and then on top of that with
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
the provider quite frankly is going to
 
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
do the work based upon a
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
screening the funding of a screening
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
which is different than an exam I think
 
01:21:29.709 --> 01:21:29.719 align:start position:0%
the real challenge here is it's like
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
lead poisoning if you don't get the
 
01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
parent involved by the time they get to
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
first and second grade and they've had
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
lead poisoning it's
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
over the real time to get to the child
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
is between the ages of zero and
 
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
two so I don't know you rais a good
 
01:21:50.189 --> 01:21:50.199 align:start position:0%
point representative Murphy I don't know
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
how we can encourage parents to do the
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
screenings with it's light screening
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
hearing you raise a good point well so
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's why I think that the simplest
 
01:22:04.189 --> 01:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
amendment to this is to include um a
 
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
screening exam because at least takes
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
away one of the roadblocks to having a
 
01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
child before they get to school examined
 
01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
in in SC Not examined screen for their
 
01:22:17.629 --> 01:22:17.639 align:start position:0%
Vision because I was thinking about how
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
else are you going to mandate that
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
they're not in the public domain they're
 
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
not in school they're at home
 
01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
so perhaps that the the best way to
 
01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
approach that is to say as this bill
 
01:22:31.870 --> 01:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
started out maybe that was their initial
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
intent was that there they knew that
 
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
there was no reimbursement funding for
 
01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
screening so if there is Medicaid funds
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
available for
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
screening but why do they if if
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
currently Medicaid will pay for a full
 
01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.870 align:start position:0%
currently Medicaid will pay for a full
eye

01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
eye
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
exam why would you
 
01:22:54.430 --> 01:22:54.440 align:start position:0%
then look for funding for screenings
 
01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
because they can go to the eye doctor
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
today at any age and get a full exam
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
fully paid
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
for so you get back to the parental
 
01:23:07.709 --> 01:23:07.719 align:start position:0%
responsibility right that's saying can I
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
can I suggest a so so based on what I've
 
01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
heard and and I'm gonna say I don't
 
01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
think we're going to solve the this like
 
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
0 to2 or 0o to five problem with right
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
now but based on what I'm hearing
 
01:23:25.229 --> 01:23:25.239 align:start position:0%
hearing I have taken that section and I
 
01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
have changed a little bit of language so
 
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to read the whole thing and
 
01:23:30.189 --> 01:23:30.199 align:start position:0%
then I'll go back and sort of spell out
 
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
where I've specifically where I've
 
01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
changed the language vision screening of
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
pupils there shall be a vision screening
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
or Vision
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
examination by a qualified medical
 
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
provider of each child prior to or upon
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
first entry into the public school
 
01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
system and thereafter as often as deemed
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
necessary by the local school Authority
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
the result of the child child's vision
 
01:23:54.669 --> 01:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
screening shall be presented to the
 
01:23:57.310 --> 01:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
local school
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
guardians or
 
01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
Guardians on a form provided by the
 
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%

[Music]

01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
examination shall be required of a
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
child who I'm going to say no vision
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
screening or examination shall be
 
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
required of a child whose parent or
 
01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
Guardian objects th to in writing period
 
01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
a student is not required to submit to
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
any vision screening required by this
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
section if the parent or Guardian
 
01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
submits a statement that the student
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
received a comprehensive ey and vision
 
01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
examination in the last 12 months or if
 
01:24:47.709 --> 01:24:47.719 align:start position:0%
the student has a current diagnosis of
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
per permanent vision loss so the changes
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
that I made are in the first line there
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
shall be a vision screening or Vision
 
01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
examination which solves I think solves
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid problem because that's
 
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
available the funding part yes yes uh by
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
a qualified medical
 
01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
provider uh and then I added that the
 
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
information will go to school officials
 
01:25:15.070 --> 01:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
and parents or
 
01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0%
Guardians on a form provided Etc no
 
01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
vision screening or examination shall be
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
required of a child whose parent or
 
01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
Guardian objects therefore to in writing
 
01:25:28.109 --> 01:25:28.119 align:start position:0%
I crossed out on the grounds that such
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
examination is contrary to the child's
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
religious tenants and teachings so it's
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
just if they object in writing period a
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
student is not required to submit to any
 
01:25:39.149 --> 01:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
vision screening required okay so that
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
that those are all the changes so that
 
01:25:42.669 --> 01:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
would be only that paragraph would be
 
01:25:45.629 --> 01:25:45.639 align:start position:0%
the amendment to
 
01:25:49.109 --> 01:25:49.119 align:start position:0%
200 you tell me because I think you're
 
01:25:51.629 --> 01:25:51.639 align:start position:0%
you're probably the one who would be
 
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
sponsoring the amendment I I'm not sure
 
01:25:55.390 --> 01:25:55.400 align:start position:0%
if I want to sponsor the amendment or
 
01:25:57.870 --> 01:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
not well Dr think this is a vast impr
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
mury he's sponsor of the bill so if he
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
wants to bring the amendment forward I'd
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
be more than glad to do it it's Nancy
 
01:26:07.229 --> 01:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
Murphy oh it's Nancy Murphy yeah uh oh
 
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
okay I'll I'll be more than glad to
 
01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
bring It Forward I would make I don't
 
01:26:11.109 --> 01:26:11.119 align:start position:0%
even mind bringing it Forward myself I'm
 
01:26:12.990 --> 01:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
just saying okay
 
01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
than so so can I make it recommend it to
 
01:26:19.109 --> 01:26:19.119 align:start position:0%
the chair though I think yes on your
 
01:26:22.350 --> 01:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
wording though we talked about if we
 
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
have the local school authorities create
 
01:26:27.149 --> 01:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
the form we're going have a variety of
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
forms versus a form developed by the
 
01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Health Human
 
01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
Services and I subsequently so so I
 
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
could go either way on that I
 
01:26:39.109 --> 01:26:39.119 align:start position:0%
subsequently noticed that rsa2 200
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
section 32 already says um on a form
 
01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
provided by local school authorities so
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
for the physical exam it's already by by
 
01:26:52.830 --> 01:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
local school authorities so um
 
01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
it it is a it was more of a question
 
01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:55.990 align:start position:0%
it it is a it was more of a question
than

01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
a major
 
01:27:00.910 --> 01:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
concern so the question still stands you
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
know which which do you think is
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate given the fact that we've
 
01:27:06.510 --> 01:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
been doing this per since what 2009 at
 
01:27:10.030 --> 01:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
least um with a local school Authority
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
Forum I okay with
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
it okay so because in my mind that
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
really simplifies it IT addresses the
 
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement by Medicaid at least for
 
01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.910 align:start position:0%
reimbursement by Medicaid at least for
scening

01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
scening
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
it signifies or you know specifies a
 
01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.229 align:start position:0%
it signifies or you know specifies a
qualified

01:27:28.229 --> 01:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
provider and recognizing that you
 
01:27:32.830 --> 01:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily can't mandate what a parent
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
does with their children before they get
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
to school and they in the public domain
 
01:27:39.070 --> 01:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
period so I would be okay with that okay
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
so I am emailing to both of you the
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
language that I just read and it has any
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
changes highlighted in
 
01:27:52.669 --> 01:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
red and including
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
language that has been struck out um so
 
01:27:59.830 --> 01:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
assuming that that is the the amendment
 
01:28:02.830 --> 01:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
as it will or or extremely close to the
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
amendment as it would go to actually
 
01:28:07.390 --> 01:28:07.400 align:start position:0%
make me let me make one more
 
01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:09.510 align:start position:0%
make me let me make one more
change

01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:28:13.229 --> 01:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
um which is the title um we we ought to
 
01:28:13.239 --> 01:28:14.430 align:start position:0%
um which is the title um we we ought to
also

01:28:14.430 --> 01:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
consider the title a change to the title
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
bill to to something like
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh well let's let's see what the RSA
 
01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:32.669 align:start position:0%
uh well let's let's see what the RSA
says

01:28:32.669 --> 01:28:32.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:37.390 --> 01:28:37.400 align:start position:0%
um yeah the r the RSA
 
01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
um the RSA the existing RSA just simply
 
01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
says physical examination of pupils so
 
01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to um suggest that whoever
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
sponsors the amendment come up with a
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
change to to the to the title as well
 
01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
that is more suitable to what the
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
amendment now actually says so would it
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
be establishing um
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
um Medicaid funding for children's
 
01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
vision screening initiative but it's not
 
01:29:09.149 --> 01:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
Medicaid it's not Medicaid funding at
 
01:29:10.629 --> 01:29:10.639 align:start position:0%
this point there's no change to Medicaid
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
funding it's simply we're including it
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
now um well know what we're doing what
 
01:29:18.510 --> 01:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
we're doing is no we're not CH we would
 
01:29:21.109 --> 01:29:21.119 align:start position:0%
not be changing anything about Medicaid
 
01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
at all we'd Simply Be we'd actually be
 
01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:26.719 align:start position:0%
changing the the requirement from it can
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
be vision screening or it can be a
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
vision examination and if it's an Vision
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
exam Medica it's probably a lot more
 
01:29:36.189 --> 01:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
expensive but Medicaid covers it right
 
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:29:42.109 --> 01:29:42.119 align:start position:0%
so um or a school could decide that they
 
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
want to provide that as just part of
 
01:29:48.430 --> 01:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
what they do but that's not a 21 28a
 
01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
violation because they're making the
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
choice to do it yeah so that change in
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
first sentence basically would say that
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is going to cover exams and or
 
01:30:00.109 --> 01:30:00.119 align:start position:0%
screenings I'm I'm going to say I I
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
think what we're suggesting and correct
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong representative Merchant
 
01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
but I think what is being suggested is
 
01:30:09.629 --> 01:30:09.639 align:start position:0%
is replace the entire bill with what I
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
just read exactly so the the bill
 
01:30:14.109 --> 01:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
therefore would not mention Medicaid it
 
01:30:16.109 --> 01:30:16.119 align:start position:0%
would not create make any changes to
 
01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid in fact it would not require
 
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
Services to do anything
 
01:30:27.149 --> 01:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
um and I would argue that the finance
 
01:30:28.750 --> 01:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
committee would probably take a look at
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
this and
 
01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
say why why is it coming back to us well
 
01:30:34.270 --> 01:30:34.280 align:start position:0%
because the original bill was marked
 
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
with a with a fiscal note
 
01:30:41.070 --> 01:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
um so so I think though it does not
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
mention Medicaid it effectively does
 
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
cover the screening though because it's
 
01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
in the previous Bill the way this is
 
01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
written somebody who needs to get that
 
01:30:52.510 --> 01:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
that vision screening
 
01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
um and I should probably add because the
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
title says vision screening of pupil
 
01:30:59.390 --> 01:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
pupils we should probably say vision
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
screening or
 
01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:03.470 align:start position:0%
screening or
examination

01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
examination
 
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
screening is not paid for by medicator
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
most anyone okay because it's not part
 
01:31:15.109 --> 01:31:15.119 align:start position:0%
of your medical benefit the exam is
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
right so if you're a
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
parent logical thing to do if you go to
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
an eye doctor is have an exam screen no
 
01:31:25.229 --> 01:31:25.239 align:start position:0%
I by adding that it it makes it better I
 
01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:27.400 align:start position:0%
get it but it gives it gives the school
 
01:31:30.669 --> 01:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
the opportunity yeah to offer a
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
screening in L which is going to be
 
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
where the eye doctor going push back and
 
01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
say wait now you're saying they can get
 
01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
to the school system with only a
 
01:31:40.510 --> 01:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
screening and not a physical exam right
 
01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
so that Mak so and another procedural
 
01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
note and you know probably better than I
 
01:31:49.109 --> 01:31:49.119 align:start position:0%
is you know the chairman has sent that
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
to us all that's what we would
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
theoretically prop propos to the
 
01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
committee when we meet the HHS
 
01:31:57.950 --> 01:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
committee if there's any simple word
 
01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:00.280 align:start position:0%
smithing that's not a non-gain change
 
01:32:03.629 --> 01:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
can we do that without a committee
 
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
reconvening my understanding is yes I
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
mean what what we are doing is we I mean
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
if if there's a and that's why I say
 
01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
whoever sponsors the amendment I'm I'm
 
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
open to right leaving it to the
 
01:32:17.229 --> 01:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
amendment sponsor to determine what an
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate title would
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
be and and and in fact I'm I'm slightly
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
changing what I sent you because what I
 
01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
didn't include in that was the beginning
 
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
of that section where it says new
 
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
section vision screening of pupils amend
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
RSA 2 200 by inserting after section 32
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
the following new section so I've added
 
01:32:39.550 --> 01:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
that and I've also changed it from
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
vision screening or examination of
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
pupils um so that examination is in
 
01:32:46.590 --> 01:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
there as well
 
01:32:51.310 --> 01:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair we basically taken 200
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
Colum 32 and revising that or are we
 
01:32:59.070 --> 01:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
taking colon 32A and adding it to the
 
01:33:03.070 --> 01:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
statute we are taking 32A which is part
 
01:33:06.109 --> 01:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
of the bill correct we are making some
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
changes to it to reflect some concerns
 
01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
like not listing all of the various
 
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
types of providers but simply saying
 
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
qualified provider and some other
 
01:33:18.030 --> 01:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
changes like exam adding
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
examination um so again those changes
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
are all in the the version that I just
 
01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
sent you but I'm going to send you a new
 
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
version M uh which again almost exactly
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
the same but before we proceed let me
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
just for the sake of absolute Clarity
 
01:33:44.830 --> 01:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
time so this would be a a an amendment
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
to replace the entire uh we an amendment
 
01:33:57.629 --> 01:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
to change the title to something
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate as deemed by the
 
01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:34:05.669 --> 01:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
sponsor and then the the body of the of
 
01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment would be replace
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
everything after the enacting Clause
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
with the following new section vision
 
01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
screening or examination of pups amend
 
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
RSA 200 by inserting after section 32
 
01:34:23.790 --> 01:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
the following new section am mend RSA
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
232a vision
 
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
screening or examination of pupils there
 
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
shall be a vision screening or Vision
 
01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
examination by a qualified medical
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
provider of each child prior to or upon
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
first entry into the public school
 
01:34:42.189 --> 01:34:42.199 align:start position:0%
system and thereafter as often as deemed
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
necessary by the local school Authority
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
the result of the child's vision
 
01:34:47.310 --> 01:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
screening shall be presented to the
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
local school officials and parents or
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
Guardians on a form provided by the
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
local school authorities no vision
 
01:34:58.109 --> 01:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
screening or examination shall be
 
01:34:59.910 --> 01:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
required of a child whose parent or
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
Guardian objects th to in writing period
 
01:35:05.790 --> 01:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
a student is not required to submit to
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
any vision screening required by the
 
01:35:08.830 --> 01:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
section if the parent or Guardian
 
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
submits a statement that the student
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
received a comprehensive eye and vision
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
examination in the last 12 months or if
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
the student has a current diagnosis of
 
01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
permanent vision
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
loss so that is what I'm here ing
 
01:35:27.070 --> 01:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
um we're interested in proposing not to
 
01:35:29.790 --> 01:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
throw a monkey wrench into it but I'm
 
01:35:33.149 --> 01:35:33.159 align:start position:0%
going to if I look
 
01:35:39.390 --> 01:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
at 200 col 32A and look at 200 colon 32
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
we have I think a potential conflict
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
between the two sections the first
 
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
section under the 32 you can only opt
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
out for religious tenants or teachings
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
under 32A we're allowing them to opt out
 
01:36:00.109 --> 01:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
period so in essence one part of the
 
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
statute is saying you only can opt out
 
01:36:05.109 --> 01:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
based upon this reason and the other one
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
says well I can opt out for any
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
conflict I had considered that you know
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
we might want to propose going back to
 
01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
32 and removing that however I think
 
01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
that that gets us into non- gerain
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment right position okay um sorry
 
01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
so I I would be inclined to Simply say
 
01:36:34.669 --> 01:36:34.679 align:start position:0%
you know this is this is how this
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
section will look if this passes I agree
 
01:36:39.629 --> 01:36:39.639 align:start position:0%
with that not to get into the Weeds
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
about it but um just the title of the
 
01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
vision screening of pupils is there a
 
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
need to have a pups in there versus just
 
01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:47.910 align:start position:0%
need to have a pups in there versus just
vision

01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
vision
 
01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
screening it's in the education statute
 
01:36:52.669 --> 01:36:52.679 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't actually think it is
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
and um although representative Merchant
 
01:36:57.550 --> 01:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
said it's pupils as an I not pupils as
 
01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
in students I've actually read it as
 
01:37:04.229 --> 01:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
pupils as in students so okay um so
 
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
considering that that would be a a a an
 
01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
a non-material change uh but as I have
 
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
read it I think that is what we are
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
agreeing ought to be proposed at least
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
and again I'm
 
01:37:21.629 --> 01:37:21.639 align:start position:0%
not I'm not sure yet where I stand on it
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
I think I'm I generally feel like this
 
01:37:27.109 --> 01:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
whole thing needs a lot of work but um
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
it certainly is something I could live
 
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
with um
 
01:37:38.109 --> 01:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.709 --> 01:37:41.719 align:start position:0%
motion I'll make a motion to accept
 
01:37:47.589 --> 01:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
the revised language for the bill 580
 
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
FN and to bring that revision as a form
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
of an amendment to our committee full
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee during the executive
 
01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
session I can second that okay
 
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
um so are you recommending ought to pass
 
01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:07.070 align:start position:0%
um so are you recommending ought to pass
with

01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:38:12.109 --> 01:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes okay so we have a motion
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
by representative
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
Merchant we have a second by
 
01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:19.390 align:start position:0%
Merchant we have a second by
representative

01:38:19.390 --> 01:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:24.109 --> 01:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
Murphy and um we do not
 
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
have I'm going to say in drafting for
 
01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:27.750 align:start position:0%
have I'm going to say in drafting for
the

01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
amendment and
 
01:38:34.350 --> 01:38:34.360 align:start position:0%
um will who wants to take responsibility
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
for getting that to OSS and asking them
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
to make a formal make the formal changes
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
and presumably you might both want your
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
name on the amendment but one of you
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
needs to take lead I can go either way
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
if yeah sure if you wanna that's fine
 
01:38:54.109 --> 01:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
send it to me I'll send it to LS L okay
 
01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
y sure um all right
 
01:39:01.070 --> 01:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
so proba stop stop by on the way
 
01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
out all right so
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
um so we have an so the motion on on the
 
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
floor is
 
01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:10.270 align:start position:0%
floor is
otpa

01:39:10.270 --> 01:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
otpa
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
um so for the sake of formality I will
 
01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
do a roll call Representative
 
01:39:19.229 --> 01:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
Merchant I representative Murphy
 
01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
yes and
 
01:39:24.669 --> 01:39:24.679 align:start position:0%
I I'm going to be a no um so that's
 
01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
going to be a two to
 
01:39:31.310 --> 01:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
one and um I believe that that completes
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
our business for the day is there
 
01:39:38.589 --> 01:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
discuss okay with that I thank you for
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
your your uh participation here and I
 
01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
will close the hearing or the
 
01:39:49.709 --> 01:39:49.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work
 
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
you
