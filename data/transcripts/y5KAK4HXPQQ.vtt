00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 align:start position:0%

everybody should have it and it is on
 
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 align:start position:0%

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
mickey do you want to go through and
 
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
explain what this does and
 
00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
what it will cause us to do sure so the
 
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
two amendments that we
 
00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
approved earlier today had transfers
 
00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 align:start position:0%
between the education trust fund and the
 
00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
general fund included so
 
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
if you recall the first one that we had
 
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
done that had the
 
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
dot transfers and excuse me the dot
 
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
um uh andrea dot and school building aid
 
00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
in there there was a transfer over the
 
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
biennium of 36.7 million dollars out of
 
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund to fund
 
00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 align:start position:0%
some things the second amendment that we
 
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
adopted this morning had a
 
00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
100 million dollar swing of money going
 
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
the other way
 
00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 align:start position:0%
so it was suggested that rather than
 
00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.670 align:start position:0%
so it was suggested that rather than
having

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
36.7 going one way and a hundred million
 
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
dollars going
 
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
the other way we just do the net of that
 
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
which is 63.3 going one way
 
00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
so what the committee could do is if you
 
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to adopt this amendment
 
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
i would modify those previously approved
 
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
amendments to take out
 
00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 align:start position:0%
the transfers so we don't have multiple
 
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
transfers happening we can just do it
 
00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
one time
 
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
so there's no net impact of this motion
 
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's just uh
 
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
instead of two swings of money we're
 
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
just going to do one to kind of clean up
 
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 as well as the surplus
 
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.990 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 as well as the surplus
statement

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
anyone have any thoughts madam chair
 
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
yes please go ahead um
 
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
my question is so this means that we
 
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.990 align:start position:0%
my question is so this means that we
will

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
not take money out of the education
 
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.350 align:start position:0%
not take money out of the education
trust

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
trust
 
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
will simply reduce the amount of money
 
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
coming into the education trust
 
00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 align:start position:0%
right and so it keeps it clean that way
 
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
and accomplishes um not taking money out
 
00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 align:start position:0%
of the trust to be used for d.o.t
 
00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 align:start position:0%
yeah those appropriations for dot will
 
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
still occur from the general fund
 
00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 align:start position:0%
it's just there's going to be no money
 
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
exiting the education trust fund
 
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you that's what i was hoping
 
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
it would do thank you
 
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions comments
 
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i'm i think i'm okay with
 
00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to
 
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
um i understand all these amendments
 
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
because i'm here but i was worried
 
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
going forward if people are trying to
 
00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
reconstruct things going backwards that
 
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
that might be confusing
 
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
but um the way representative heath just
 
00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 align:start position:0%
posed her question um to mickey
 
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 align:start position:0%
it seems like it is actually less
 
00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:20.630 align:start position:0%
it seems like it is actually less
confusing

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
and i like that it doesn't make this
 
00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 align:start position:0%
it doesn't we're not looking at taking
 
00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 align:start position:0%
money from education
 
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
out of the trust fund which is you know
 
00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 align:start position:0%
for a lot of people a very very
 
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable thing to do
 
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
so this is putting in basically less
 
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
money into the education trust fund that
 
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to use
 
00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
and the transportation money comes out
 
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
of general fund
 
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm just is that i think i'm
 
00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
repeating what representative heath said
 
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
i wanted to make sure that that's kind
 
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
of what it means
 
00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
that's a correct understanding and as
 
00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
far as trying to track
 
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
all the work we're doing um i'm gonna do
 
00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
something once we officially close our
 
00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
business on house bill one and two
 
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
that'll make it
 
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
clear for the committee and the public
 
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
we'll put it online as far as
 
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
what the division ultimately has
 
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.350 align:start position:0%
what the division ultimately has
recommended

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
for amendments and changes to the budget
 
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
that you'll be bringing to the full
 
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.110 align:start position:0%
that you'll be bringing to the full
committee

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon that we adopt
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
amendments and then reconsider
 
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
them and you know whether it's on a zoom
 
00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 align:start position:0%
or in a committee meeting sometimes it's
 
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
hard to keep track of everything but
 
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
certainly when we're done our business i
 
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
will make it clear as to
 
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
you know what we've got in our plan to
 
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
bring to the full committee
 
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
i'm very supportive of it you have not
 
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
um i guess realistically or not taking
 
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
money out of the education trust fund
 
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
but just
 
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other
 
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none could i have
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
a motion to approve
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
amendment 1027h
 
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
and just to modify or expand on the
 
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.230 align:start position:0%
and just to modify or expand on the
motion

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 align:start position:0%

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
house bill two so we can't really use it
 
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.110 align:start position:0%
house bill two so we can't really use it
for

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
but we can look at the language and you
 
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
know while the house bill two amendment
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
is being drafted you can at least have
 
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 align:start position:0%
the discussion
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
okay so if you'd like i can uh i can
 
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
bring that up
 
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
and we can do you want to bring that
 
00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
bring that up in as well or
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
we'll bring mark in or mark excuse me
 
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
hi mark hello good afternoon
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
let me bear with you perhaps you could
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh kind of walk us through
 
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
what this does um
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
why it's uh something that appears to be
 
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.870 align:start position:0%
why it's uh something that appears to be
necessary

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
you could um so when the governor was
 
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
modeling out adequacy as well as um all
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
the fiscal notes we've been providing
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
we've been under the assumption that we
 
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
are hoping for a
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
normal spring assessment so spring
 
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
assessment is
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
that we'll be doing the third grade
 
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
reading assessment testing for third
 
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
grade reading proficiency
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
and those numbers um depending on how
 
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
people score how kids score
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
gets rolled into a differential aid
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
category called the third grade reading
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
differential aid category
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
um so we've been assuming that for 2021
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
the spring of 20 the spring we're in
 
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
we'll have normal assessment numbers but
 
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
now we're starting to have doubts that
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
we'll have
 
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
wide participation in our schools with a
 
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.869 align:start position:0%
wide participation in our schools with a
assessment

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
so those numbers that we provided that
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
the governor has
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
put in his model for adequacy and the
 
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
numbers we've been providing to mickey
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
are assuming are based on 2019
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
assessment data
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
so what the amendment i sent to to you
 
00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:30.070 align:start position:0%
so what the amendment i sent to to you
and

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
and
mickey

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:31.030 align:start position:0%
mickey
 
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.670 align:start position:0%
mickey
[Music]

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
has us look at 2019 data
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
and have us look at 2021 data and pick
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
the better data set
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
so what it would do is completely match
 
00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:43.670 align:start position:0%
so what it would do is completely match
how

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
the governor has built adequacy and
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
completely match how all the formulas
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
all the adequacy spreadsheets you've
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
been looking at um
 
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
it would were based on the assumption
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
that 2020 assessment data would match
 
00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:55.990 align:start position:0%
that 2020 assessment data would match
2019

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
2019
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
so all this amendment does is um we will
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
look at 2019 assessment data and we look
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
at 2021 assessment data and pick the
 
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
greater of the two data sets
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
so it's not predicted to have any impact
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry representative rosen
 
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.550 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry representative rosen
murray

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
murray
 
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm not sure when we've got
 
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
these little pictures what you can
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
actually see
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
can you explain why it wouldn't have an
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
effect on the budget because
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
it it um you know there's going to be a
 
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
difference in the numbers
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
um in the adma and why wouldn't that
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
have an effect on the budget
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah so um it will um impact
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
the numbers certainly
 
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
but when the governor was building his
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
budget he assumed
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
um in that 900 some odd million that you
 
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
have in front of you
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
um he assumed assessment would be around
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
the um 2019 levels and so he's
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
so all we're doing is is making sure
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
that assumption
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
takes place um because we'll probably
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
have really
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
low participation in the assessments in
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
2021 which will pay the state fiscal
 
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
year 2022 adequacy
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
so for budgeting purposes this will have
 
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:13.750 align:start position:0%
so for budgeting purposes this will have
no

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
impact because it would be essentially
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
using the same numbers that have already
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
built into your assumption
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
that we'll have a clean assessment in
 
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.750 align:start position:0%
that we'll have a clean assessment in
2021

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
2021
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
um so have no it's just it's just having
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
match the assumptions essentially thank
 
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.710 align:start position:0%
match the assumptions essentially thank
you

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative heath so thank you madam
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
chair so
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
um this actually
 
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.110 align:start position:0%
um this actually
um

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
fixes the enrollment issue
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
that um but this piece of it is only
 
00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:50.069 align:start position:0%
that um but this piece of it is only
specific

00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
to that that category itself
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
it does not cross categories
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
so we would only be using the enrollment
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
data for this one purpose or will this
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
cover all purposes will this fix the
 
00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:07.590 align:start position:0%
cover all purposes will this fix the
problem

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
that school districts across the state
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
are going through right now
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
so representative heath what you're
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
looking at is senate bill 135
 
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
which covers all of the all of the adma
 
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.350 align:start position:0%
which covers all of the all of the adma
components

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
components
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
um like you just said um so that covers
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
your your regular enrollment fnr
 
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
third grade reading special education
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
that's what senate bill 135 does
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
if you were just looking to fix the
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
third grade issue
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
third grade reading assessment data
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's the amendment i've
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
i've passed on to representative
 
00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:41.590 align:start position:0%
i've passed on to representative
umberger

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
umberger
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
but but yeah the this one would deal
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
with all the adma components but i've
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
drafted a
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
draft language to fix just the third
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
if i may yeah certainly
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
so this then will not um
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
apply to the overall
 
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0%
adequacy only to this reading
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
issue yep the amendment that's ols is
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
currently working on would only apply to
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
the third grade reading component that's
 
00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:15.509 align:start position:0%
the third grade reading component that's
correct

00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
madam chair can i ask another question
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
yes you may
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
so um that we know that school districts
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
across the state have seen
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
big drops manchester has seen
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
at least six to seven hundred nashua six
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
to seven hundred
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
and that pretty much parlays pretty much
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
with freedom-reduced
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
lunch as well so
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
this amendment will not relate to those
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
numbers or will it
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
um it's tricky the amendment in front of
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
you that's on the screen
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
would would would do what you would do
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
what you're saying would relate to all
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
those numbers
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
but the amendment that ols is drafting
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
would would not
 
00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:04.839 align:start position:0%
cover base enrollment and all the other
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
components all right
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah representative i think
 
00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:11.269 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah representative i think
that

00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
135 covers all those things that you're
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
but this amendment is specific to
 
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
third grade reading period and that yeah
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
and that they're asking
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
for this amendment to
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that what's calculated
 
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
in our formula matches what the law
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
is and right now it does not
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
so to better clarify the amendment that
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
ols is working on right now
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
really syncs up to if you look at line
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
six um
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
line six to line 11. that would just
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
deal with the third grade reading
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
essentially that would just deal with
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
you're a follow-up representative i do
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
so again um this will not solve the
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
problem the districts are having
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
overall this will just address one piece
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
this this will not fund if they're
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
suffering loss and enrollments this will
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
not um
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
this will not give them extra money for
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay so when this amendment
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
gets back from ols
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
is there anyone that will have a problem
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
okay i don't see that so
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
close this out mary did you have another
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
question or
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
nope you're still muted sorry my screen
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
moved over and i couldn't see the mute
 
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.790 align:start position:0%
moved over and i couldn't see the mute
button

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
we support that section of it but i'm
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
also concerned that it doesn't fix
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
the bigger issue that school districts
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
have across the state
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
and um sb 135 addresses some of it but
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
not all of it
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
so um yes we support the section but um
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
we'd like to see more i certainly
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative heath and i think that's
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
what uh
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
your amendment is trying to address
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
right now okay we need to fix
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
the um third grade reading scores
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
or whatever third grade people
 
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
scoring below proficient and um
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
i have no idea when uh
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
when they'll have the tests to make sure
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
to figure that out
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
so okay um i understand
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
mickey has sent
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment that you have
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
proposed or are proposing
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
yeah amendment uh 1028h
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative heath's amendment um
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
should was this email to everybody
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
and we've got it online too if it's not
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
already there it'll be refreshed shortly
 
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:42.710 align:start position:0%
already there it'll be refreshed shortly
so

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
the public can find it there too so we
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
can share that screen
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
as well um i may see if andrea is
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
available to do that
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
well she looks like a stick figure but
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
i assume that means she's there
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
i am here madam chair and it is actually
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
online i will bring it up right on the
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
screen for you right now
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's up on the screen now if everyone
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
can see it okay
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath you want to walk
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
through this
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
for us i'd be happy to and then um i'm
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
sure mickey will
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
help me if i um if i'm inaccurate on any
 
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.350 align:start position:0%
help me if i um if i'm inaccurate on any
point

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
so basically what this amendment says
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
it appropriates the hundred million
 
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.909 align:start position:0%
it appropriates the hundred million
dollars

00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
for the fiscal year ending 23
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
to the education trust and i'm going to
 
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
just move down to number two
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
where it says for fiscal years 2022-23
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
the total education
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
grant to each municipality pursuant to
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
rsa 198 colon 41
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
shall be adjusted to an amount no less
 
00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:23.830 align:start position:0%
shall be adjusted to an amount no less
than

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
such grant in prior years
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
which takes care of the issue around
 
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.470 align:start position:0%
which takes care of the issue around
enrollment

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
however total adjustments for the
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
biennium ending june 30th
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
2023 uh shall not exceed 100 million
 
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:38.470 align:start position:0%
2023 uh shall not exceed 100 million
dollars

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
unless pursuant to paragraph three
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
the department of education shall
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
prorate adjustments as necessary
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
so what um section three does
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
any unspent surplus balance in the
 
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.150 align:start position:0%
any unspent surplus balance in the
education

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
trust fund as of june 30th 2023
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
shall be applied to increase the hundred
 
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.110 align:start position:0%
shall be applied to increase the hundred
dollar

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
100 million dollar cap on the total
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
education grant
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
so basically this is like a waterfall
 
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.070 align:start position:0%
so basically this is like a waterfall
effect

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
then those funds would be applied
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
and correct me if i'm wrong mickey these
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
funds would be applied
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
to the allocations in districts now i
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
just want to use i'm going to use
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
farmington because that's um a district
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
where representative petry comes from
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the chart
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
that was sent to you
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
this morning by um mickey you'll see
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
that what farmington would receive
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
under house bill 623 and then
 
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
under 135 so the amount
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
for farmington it's it's over a million
 
00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.750 align:start position:0%
for farmington it's it's over a million
dollars

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
it would be pro-rated uh based on the
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
amount of money we have because now it's
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
only a hundred million dollars
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
and so without any of this farmington
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
only gets about 200
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
000 and i don't have the chart in front
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
of me so i'm just
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
doing estimates so the
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
each school district will effectively
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
get more funding based on
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
the allocations that we sent out
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
um in the last biennium but i think the
 
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.230 align:start position:0%
um in the last biennium but i think the
advantages

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
advantages
 
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:34.060 align:start position:0%
of this the proposal um
 
00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.190 align:start position:0%
of this the proposal um
[Music]

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
the previous proposal that we have it
 
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:38.789 align:start position:0%
the previous proposal that we have it
really

00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
it reduces statewide property taxes
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
by a certain percentage
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
but in fact those communities
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
that have been most hit with
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
the impact of kobit and that it's
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
more difficult from for them to raise
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
what will happen is we're going to see
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
maybe on one side
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
something's going to go down but then on
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
the local property taxes
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to see an increase so i
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
think all in all
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
the districts that need the bigger
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
benefit that's
 
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
offered through this amendment will win
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
and with the other amendment everybody
 
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
gets a reduction
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
but many will end up seeing a
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
significant increase in their property
 
00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.750 align:start position:0%
significant increase in their property
taxes

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that there will not be
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
a higher level of adequacy funding for
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
those districts
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
i think i've covered everything mickey
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
i think that i think that covers what
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment does
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
so i ask for your support for this
 
00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.870 align:start position:0%
so i ask for your support for this
amendment

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's um it's an amendment
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
it does it fixes the enrollment numbers
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
it it adds to the amount of money going
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
to school districts
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
effectively this will result
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
in a a more proportional a more
 
00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:15.590 align:start position:0%
in a a more proportional a more
proportionate

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
proportionate
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
reduction i know well in property taxes
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
than than what the initial proposal will
 
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.029 align:start position:0%
than than what the initial proposal will
do

00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
and you know it's just the more affluent
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
school districts are going to make out
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
and the poorer school districts like
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
farmington like berlin like manchester
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
um nashua so many of these districts
 
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:38.630 align:start position:0%
um nashua so many of these districts
that

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
have so felt the impact
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
of of the pandemic won't
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
feel the benefits that this amendment
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
will offer
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
so i ask for your support thank you very
 
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.549 align:start position:0%
so i ask for your support thank you very
much

00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative murray thank you
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i had a couple things um one what
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
appeals to me about this in particular
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
that this is education trust
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
fund money that is going directly to
 
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.510 align:start position:0%
fund money that is going directly to
education

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
as opposed to kind of taking a backward
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
spin towards the swept funds it also
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
provides the municipalities the
 
00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:20.390 align:start position:0%
provides the municipalities the
opportunity

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
if it suits what they want to do to make
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
their own decisions about how to manage
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
the sweat funds
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
i was trying to do some math very
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
quickly and i probably did not do it
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
well i was looking up the numbers of
 
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
farmington since
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
um representative heath brought that up
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
and quickly and i could be wrong so i'm
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
a little anxious about this
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
but um it's a it's a significant amount
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
of money
 
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
that farmington would get going this
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
route as opposed to
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
sort of the difference between you know
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
everybody in town getting twenty dollars
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
um to do whatever they want with as
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
aggregating all that money and putting
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
all that money towards
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
directly towards education so i do like
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
that this is education money that is
 
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.909 align:start position:0%
that this is education money that is
directed

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
directed
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
immediately towards education as opposed
 
00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:07.669 align:start position:0%
immediately towards education as opposed
to

00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
another program so that's my comments
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else that has a comment
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
okay i don't see any hands hands raised
 
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
where it says shall be
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
adjusted to amount
 
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
no less than such grant in the prior
 
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.590 align:start position:0%
no less than such grant in the prior
year

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
so this is taking it back
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
to 21
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
even though the money that was provided
 
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.230 align:start position:0%
even though the money that was provided
in

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
21 from the um
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
adequacy was a number i don't have in
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
front of me
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
but that is the number that you would be
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
working from because that's what that
 
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.190 align:start position:0%
working from because that's what that
says

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
i'm just getting my book
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to see what uh what was
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
um mickey maybe you know the answer
 
00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:45.919 align:start position:0%
as opposed to me unless you're um
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so so are you looking for the total
 
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.909 align:start position:0%
yeah so so are you looking for the total
estimated

00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
estimated
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh essentially what the level would be
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
compared to no less than like that what
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
the amount was in 21 essentially
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
yes so it's about uh 1 billion
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
13 million is the number that we've got
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
but is that just adequacy or is that
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
adequacy plus that's the total education
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
grant so that includes
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
adequacy stabilization swept that's
 
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
retained locally everything
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
right but is it that that figure
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
is the 62 000
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
million plus is that correct yeah that
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
that 62 million was part of that so that
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
one time
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity aid and
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
additional aid on free reduced lunches
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
part of that billion dollar number two
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay so that 62 million dollars would
 
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
have to come out of here
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
because that was not provided in
 
00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.149 align:start position:0%
because that was not provided in
adequacy

00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
it was provided someplace else it's not
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
cost of an adequate education but it was
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
in the calculation of a total education
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
grant so the intent of this amendment is
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
to include everything
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
including that additional 62.5 million
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
i don't understand that i'm sorry so
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of this amendment and
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
the term total education grant
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
refers to the cost of adequacy
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
right as well as any swept that's
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
raised and retained locally any
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
stabilization grant
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
or in the case of fiscal 21 those
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
one-time additional aid components of
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity and free reduced
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
lunch enhanced so
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
so when we talk total education grant in
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
the terms of fiscal 21 it includes all
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
of those components
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
and it's around just over a billion
 
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.830 align:start position:0%
and it's around just over a billion
dollars

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
in in the budget before you now and we
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
haven't touched this line
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
it's 933 million in fiscal 22 and 946
 
00:27:59.279 --> 00:27:59.990 align:start position:0%
it's 933 million in fiscal 22 and 946
million

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
this is attempting to make up for
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
the 1.024 billion is that correct
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
uh the the true amount ended up being
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
1.013 billion but yes
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
that was how much was well that's how
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
much was budgeted but the actual ended
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
up being more like 1.013
 
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:52.789 align:start position:0%
up being more like 1.013
billion

00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
so that's 54
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
and 60 right
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh i think it's the numbers i got here
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
are 74 and 67
 
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
first 22 and 23. so that's the
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
about 141 million dollars over the
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
biennium we were
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
talking about this morning however this
 
00:29:14.159 --> 00:29:14.870 align:start position:0%
talking about this morning however this
amendment

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
provides only 100 million dollars of
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
that estimate
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
therefore the proration provision okay
 
00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:24.050 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:25.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
again my concern
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
as i spoke earlier about the other
 
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.269 align:start position:0%
as i spoke earlier about the other
amendment

00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
is that um the
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh the school districts will
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
expect this amount of money no matter
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
and that is my concern
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
if adm goes down
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
then it doesn't matter because
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
you're saying in here that the number of
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
children don't matter
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
the number of free and reduced lunch
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
nothing matters they're going to get
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
this no matter what and
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
that is a total and complete
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
change to how we do
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
education funding it reminds me
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
of the stabilization grant
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
where we pay we're still paying school
 
00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.430 align:start position:0%
where we pay we're still paying school
districts

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
for stabilization
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
and what this reminds me of
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
is that's exactly what
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
the way this bill is worded and what i
 
00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.990 align:start position:0%
the way this bill is worded and what i
understand

00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
uh would occur and
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
i don't think in my mind
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
that um we can
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
continue to pay schools
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
for children that don't exist
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
and um that that's
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's one of my very major concerns
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
about this uh this legislation
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
so i see i've got two hands raised and i
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
mickey does it tell me here someplace uh
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
representative heath and representative
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
murray have their hands raised oh okay
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath were you first
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
you know i agree with you completely
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
however um
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
right now we're in a time unlike
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh any other um unlike any other
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
we are in a biennium and this
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
would affect am i correct mickey it only
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
would impact
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
this biennium because then at thereafter
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to go back to the ama count
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
that's how enrollments are fixed but
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
remember we have a year lag
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
so what school districts they got their
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
their funding but then the following
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
year when you project out they're going
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
hit with this um completely
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
um odd enrollment number that that
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't really reflect what happened and
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
it is directly due to covid
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
so i just i really think it's a win-win
 
00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.750 align:start position:0%
so i just i really think it's a win-win
situation

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
with this amendment um everybody wins
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
this way
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
and it helps to fix a problem that has
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
erupted as a direct result of covet
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative murray thank you um
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
your point around the enrollment is you
 
00:33:03.519 --> 00:33:04.230 align:start position:0%
your point around the enrollment is you
know

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
spot on is there and mickey maybe can
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
help us out
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
is there a way to adjust the language
 
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:11.750 align:start position:0%
is there a way to adjust the language
here

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
to reflect the concern that this you
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
know going forward how it is done
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
it is based on the ada um
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
and you know i see where
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
one could read this of it not being
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
there i also take representative heath's
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
point and now
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
this was such a one-off year i mean you
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
know with the covet
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
hardly any all the numbers are kind of
 
00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:36.230 align:start position:0%
hardly any all the numbers are kind of
spurious

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
spurious
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
so is there a way to address
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
representative umberger's concern
 
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
that you know in the end this needs to
 
00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.149 align:start position:0%
that you know in the end this needs to
reflect

00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
reflect
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
um actual enrollments you know is there
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
can we can we work around can we work
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
i mean current law is is essentially a
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
per capita formula so if
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
i mean not doing anything is essentially
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
paying the formula based on the kids
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
at the schools um the idea with a couple
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
of the pieces of legislation
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
from the senate were to use the
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
adm counts from the year prior to the
 
00:34:13.359 --> 00:34:14.629 align:start position:0%
adm counts from the year prior to the
pandemic

00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
to calculate grants house bill 623 took
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
a different approach and just said
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
don't even artificially recalculate the
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh student counts just determine
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
is this grant calculated gonna be less
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
than what you got last year and then
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
just bring everybody up to what they got
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
the year before
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
so there are a few different legislative
 
00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.190 align:start position:0%
so there are a few different legislative
proposals

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
proposals
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
to manipulate ed funding for 22 and 23
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
to do just to make the payments be
 
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:45.909 align:start position:0%
to do just to make the payments be
directly

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
directly
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
to how many students are in the counts
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:57.990 align:start position:0%
but the governor the governor used
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:00.710 align:start position:0%
but the governor the governor used
[Music]

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced lunch from
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
19. uh the governor so what's in house
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
bill 2 that we've already accepted to
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
stay in house bill 2
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
is an adjustment to the free reduced
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
lunch counts based on their portion of
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
our proportion of free reduced lunch
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
kids the year before so yes there is
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
in the budget already that we've uh in
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
sections 45 and 46
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
approved an adjustment to the free and
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch adm
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
so that that is in there now yes okay
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
i know that uh and i again this is
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
we talked about this earlier and that is
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
expectations and
 
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
i am very concerned
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
just like this year i can't tell you the
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
number of emails that i received
 
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
that uh they're polite
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
but uh basically saying i want my 90
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
and so instead of 90 million
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
they're now going to want 90 million
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
plus 100 million
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
to make up for what they believe they
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
have lost
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
and i guess that the other thing
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
from my perspective anyhow is
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
that according to doe
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
there are really no strings attached
 
00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.230 align:start position:0%
there are really no strings attached
what's

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
what's
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
i shouldn't say whatsoever but they're
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
very few strings attached
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
to the 350 billion that's going to be
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
distributed to the schools i guess 320
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
is going to actually be distributed to
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
the schools so
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
i just am i just am not in favor
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
of of creating
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
knowing that the money that they will be
 
00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.150 align:start position:0%
knowing that the money that they will be
getting

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
from doe to spend
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
can be spent any way
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be and so
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
i am just i just
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
i thank you and i and i understand your
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
passion okay
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
i mean i do uh but
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
um i just think that
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
um this is this is not the
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
right way to spend this money
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
because with the
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
with the other amendment um
 
00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
we're actually uh reducing
 
00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.710 align:start position:0%
we're actually uh reducing
[Music]

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
taxes and this i'm afraid
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
as we went on would not accomplish
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
that same thing because it seems
 
00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
every time we have provided money
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
to the uh school systems
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
instead of taxes going down
 
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
taxes have gone off you know i mean
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
there are all kinds of reasons why taxes
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
go up i won't
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
i won't uh argue that but um
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
anyhow uh representative heath thank you
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
so just let me talk to that a little bit
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
um school districts whoops
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
school districts will be receiving
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that's
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely true but those federal
 
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:41.670 align:start position:0%
absolutely true but those federal
dollars

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
are adequacy goes out to school
 
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.190 align:start position:0%
are adequacy goes out to school
districts

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
directly that goes right to the
 
00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.550 align:start position:0%
directly that goes right to the
municipality

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
so they have that money with the federal
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
dollars that are coming in
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
they do not go directly to the school
 
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:55.829 align:start position:0%
they do not go directly to the school
district

00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
they are provided to the school district
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
on a reimbursement
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
methodology based on a plan that the
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
school district
 
00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:07.839 align:start position:0%
sends to the department of ed so for
 
00:39:07.839 --> 00:39:08.710 align:start position:0%
sends to the department of ed so for
example

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
manchester um in the first part of money
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
they got 6.7 million dollars and
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
they haven't spent that much of it yet
 
00:39:17.359 --> 00:39:18.310 align:start position:0%
they haven't spent that much of it yet
because

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
they have just they decided to use a
 
00:39:21.119 --> 00:39:21.510 align:start position:0%
they have just they decided to use a
huge

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
huge
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
portion of that money to buy equipment
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
and there was a drag
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
on the equipment order it it's taken a
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
lot longer because everybody needs um
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
new computers and and
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
new technology equipment right now so
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
the city of manchester can't say we need
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
this money now
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
they have to wait until they spend those
 
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:42.870 align:start position:0%
they have to wait until they spend those
dollars

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
and then ask for reimbursement for those
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
dollars so that kind of creates this
 
00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
double whammy
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
so when some school districts are
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
getting these funds
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
their local school district financial
 
00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.030 align:start position:0%
their local school district financial
situation

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
is such that if they go out and spend
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
two or three million dollars they have
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
to spend it first
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
and then that creates a fiscal issue
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
right there and then
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
that it takes at least a month for the
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
department of ed
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
to reimburse the school district for
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
those dollars that they expended those
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
federal dollars
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
so you've got a a cycle going on
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at now by doing this
 
00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.150 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at now by doing this
amendment

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
we'd be directing dollars directly to
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
over which they don't have to make a
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
purchase first they have available to
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
them right away
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
the federal dollars don't work like that
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
my point um is that why i feel that this
 
00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.190 align:start position:0%
my point um is that why i feel that this
amendment

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
assists them in this arena thank you
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath i know that
 
00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned a couple times the
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
computers at
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh in manchester do you have any idea
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
how much
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh is tied up in that oh it's about two
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
okay and so the other four is what
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
um i i haven't checked that was quite a
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
while ago
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
we had met with the commissioner and
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
caitlyn um
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
to look at that part of money and then
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
to look at the
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
next um uh amount of money that was
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
coming into the city and
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
and so it's been a while so i don't know
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
what they have drawn down at this point
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
in time
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
sorry i don't know the um i don't know
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
the issue that's going on with
 
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.510 align:start position:0%
the issue that's going on with
manchester

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
u is it um you're looking for that four
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
well what what um representative heath
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
said is that they had obligated about
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
2 million for computers
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
and that they had received 6 million
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
and so i was wondering what they are
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
doing with the other
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
four million has it been spent
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
has it not been spent have the computers
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
come in
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
yeah i can look into that
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
but adam chair i mean i i'm just
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
all i'm you know i all i'm saying is is
 
00:42:22.319 --> 00:42:23.109 align:start position:0%
all i'm you know i all i'm saying is is
that

00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
i i understand how education
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
funding works in in federal grants
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
and um it's uh
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
i don't like it okay i would much rather
 
00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:38.630 align:start position:0%
i don't like it okay i would much rather
have

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
doe pay the bill and not uh
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
not have to go through the not have to
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
go through the regular role that
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh that that they do but unfortunately
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
i think that's how the education federal
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
grants work
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
so maybe you could work on that mary is
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
getting the
 
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
getting uh the education department to
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
change that but
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
um anyhow okay um
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
does anyone else have anything they'd
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
like to say
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
oh representative heath um madam chair
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
i just i'd like to move the motion i
 
00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:20.150 align:start position:0%
i just i'd like to move the motion i
think

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
that um move the amendment and i just
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
um think that this point in time this is
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
something we need to do
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
and in the long run we'll go back to the
 
00:43:31.599 --> 00:43:32.230 align:start position:0%
and in the long run we'll go back to the
regular

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
regular
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
what the law says um in terms of the adm
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
a count um but i do think this step
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
is a better step for us to take with
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
that 100 million dollars
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
rather than to reduce the
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
school-wide property tax um for each
 
00:43:52.319 --> 00:43:53.190 align:start position:0%
school-wide property tax um for each
community

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
i just think the bigger bang is going to
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
come from the hundred thousand
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
going directly to school districts thank
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
and i would ask one of my colleagues or
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
someone to make a second to this motion
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh okay
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
this is amendment 1028h
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh represent lynn when you're ready to
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
myrna votes no uh representative lynn
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
and representative umberger votes no uh
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair the vote is four to three uh
 
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
in the negative
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
okay so the uh
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment fails okay
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath did you have
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
i do comment let's say thank you for
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
allowing us um
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
the time to be able to come forward with
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment thank you very much
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
well i i feel you know i feel very
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
honestly if this amendment had come in
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
a week ago you would have had the time
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that it's only fair
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
that we allowed you the time to do this
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
so and i you know your arguments are all
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
very good arguments we just have a
 
00:45:49.359 --> 00:45:50.710 align:start position:0%
very good arguments we just have a
different

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
philosophy on what is what's the right
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
thing to do with this so
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
um mickey have we gotten the amendment
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
yet from
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
ols no we have not
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
so an option is you could make a motion
 
00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.430 align:start position:0%
so an option is you could make a motion
to

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know we saw the language drafted in
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
another bill
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
i can just be tasked with making sure
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
the house bill two amendment is drafted
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
and you don't have to vote on a number
 
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
if you are nearing the end of business
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
and you want to wrap it up
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
um that's up to you we've done that in
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
the past we haven't had to do that this
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
session because we've had everything
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
prepared in time but
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
that's not something we haven't done in
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
the past um
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
so okay so
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
so the motion the motion would be
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
to ensure the language
 
00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.790 align:start position:0%
to ensure the language
from

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
and the only thing that i'll just point
 
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
out is it we would just um tack it on to
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
the related section in
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
section 45 in in house bill 2. so
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's another kind of different thing
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
from that amendment we looked at on
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
senate bill 135
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
it was a new section for house bill 2 we
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
would add it onto an existing
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
related section same language though
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
can we move that the language
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
from amendment 10
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
10 to sb-135
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
certainly and and that'll take care of
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
it okay
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
that does it for me i mean i expect to
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
get the amendment any second now and
 
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:41.829 align:start position:0%
get the amendment any second now and
then

00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
we'll have it i'll make sure the
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
committee has it we'll put it online but
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
you can
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
kind of preempt that and just take a
 
00:47:47.599 --> 00:47:48.710 align:start position:0%
kind of preempt that and just take a
motion

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
um take a vote now allowing us to do
 
00:47:51.359 --> 00:47:52.630 align:start position:0%
um take a vote now allowing us to do
that

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
okay and then if um if the amendment
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
comes in while we're
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
voting we can change our emotion
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
okay representative murray can you just
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
give me a you know 12
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
word refresher of what this is doing
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
okay my understanding what this is doing
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
is that it is um
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
determining the adm a for third grade
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
pupils at the
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
school for the school year 2019 and 2020
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
and putting that into the budget
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
for um adequate education it's
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
already there it they just didn't have
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
authority to do it is that
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
is that correct mickey yeah the amount
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
that's in the budget now out of the
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
kind of assumed that the assessments
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
were going to go forward and and
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
so this will allow doe to use

01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
as we as we move forward we've got a
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
what a year and a half or more to
 
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh to uh to work together

01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
in the last two weeks we've had
 
01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
different people every day but i think
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%

01:05:05.349 --> 01:05:05.359 align:start position:0%

01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%

01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
intend to listen in
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
as much as i can but i obviously won't
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
be able to participate
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
but i do want to hear the discussion as
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
much as i possibly can but i'm going for
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
covet number two
 
01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
okay well you know the morning yeah the
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
morning gate
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
is all or well however long it takes us
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
to get through the uh
 
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
retain bills yeah if we could do a half
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
and half sub then you know i would be
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
down with that but
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's allowed no that's
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
not allowed once you
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
once you sub you're just yourself
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
yeah as the reporter will be joining us
 
01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:52.390 align:start position:0%
yeah as the reporter will be joining us
pardon

01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%

01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.400 align:start position:0%

01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
she's familiar with what we've been
 
01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:56.470 align:start position:0%
she's familiar with what we've been
doing

01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
right right and uh mickey do you have
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
too much work to do this weekend
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh actually the goal is gonna try to be
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
to get a lot of it done before the
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
weekend i think we're gonna
 
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
you know whatever documents that we
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
prepare for
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
monday obviously we'd like to get them
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
at least digitally into the hands of the
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
committee members as soon as we can so
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
keep your emails you know open and
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
um we will be putting everything online
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
i i'll probably be putting some sort of
 
01:06:27.359 --> 01:06:27.990 align:start position:0%
i i'll probably be putting some sort of
summary

01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
summary
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
just an easy to read summary of what
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
we've done in division just so everyone
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
can kind of
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
um make sense of some of the
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
reconsiderations we did and some of the
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
motions that kind of affected previous
 
01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
amendments you know specifically that
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
transfer thing i know is tripping some
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
people up so we'll clarify some things
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
and um that was a long answer to an easy
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
question yeah i'll probably be working
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
