00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang would you wish to lead us
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%

sure

00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
do we I believe we need to start by
 
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
adopting the minutes Mr chair I move we
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
adopt the minutes as written and
 
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
presented excuse me m Mr chair I did
 
00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
have one question on on the minutes if I
 
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
may you recogniz the last bullet uh talk
 
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
about HB 1598 the majority of the
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
committee members want to pick apart HB
 
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
1598 and most likely merge it with the
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
franchise model um I don't recall the
 
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
commission taking a vote on this so I'm
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
wondering how we arrived at that
 
00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
majority sure as reading as writing
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
those minutes I took it as the people
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
people speaking in favor of of that
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
proposal versus the ones that didn't
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
speak at all or spoke against so it was
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
just a a d derivation of the
 
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
conversation okay uh shall we amend
 
00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.550 align:start position:0%
conversation okay uh shall we amend
these

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
minutes I I believe the the and I'm
 
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959 align:start position:0%
going off of memory here but my
 
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
understanding was by using 1598 as a a
 
00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
model we just I think we need a a floor
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
where we start and if we're going to do
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
anything just having something in front
 
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
of us nothing whatever we start with any
 
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
bill that we use as kind of like a
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
beginning point is not even remotely
 
00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
close to what the final product would be
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
if we even get to that point my whole
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
point is we just want to have something
 
00:14:19.389 --> 00:14:19.399 align:start position:0%
as a kind of a reference point and I
 
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.160 align:start position:0%
think using what the same bill would
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
make it easier for everyone to follow
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
along with including members of the
 
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
public uh Mr chair I have a
 
00:14:29.749 --> 00:14:29.759 align:start position:0%
comment if if if the issue is just the
 
00:14:31.949 --> 00:14:31.959 align:start position:0%
word majority let's just delete the word
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire's therapeutic cannabis
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
program is a legislatively mandated
 
00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
program that provides critical services
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
to a segment of the New Hampshire
 
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
population that is geographically
 
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:25.400 align:start position:0%

the program has been serving patients
 
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.190 align:start position:0%
the program has been serving patients
since

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
2016 the patients we serve are
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
passionate about the program they
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
experience profound Improvement to their
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
health and quality of life through
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
symptom management from the use of
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis and they want the
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
program to be maintained and
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
improved the program's critical Partners
 
00:17:56.149 --> 00:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
include the state's licensed medical
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
providers who are able to integrate
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
alternative cannabis therapy into their
 
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
patients traditional Medical Care other
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
essential partners are the alternative
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
treatment centers which are licensed and
 
00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
regulated by the department for
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
compliance quality and
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
safety the TCP is a maturing but
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
vulnerable program we we regulate a
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
product in Industry that is federally
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
illegal and our state is impacted by a
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
rapidly evolving recreational Cannabis
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
regional market with a patchwork of
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
different state
 
00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
regulations we know that access to
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
cannabis both therapeutic and
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
recreational is oftentimes easier and
 
00:18:42.149 --> 00:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
more afford more affordable across our
 
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
borders when the topic of cannabis
 
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
legalization in New Hampshire comes up
 
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919 align:start position:0%
the questions I'm asked are always the
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
same what happens to the medical program
 
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
when New Hampshire
 
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
legalizes why is a medical program even
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
necessary if New Hampshire legalizes
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
patients would say that the TCP and the
 
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
atcs are critical to their health and
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
quality of life and they are worried
 
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
about what adult use legalization means
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
for their continued access to this
 
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
critical program I would answer with
 
00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.270 align:start position:0%
critical program I would answer with
another

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
question if New Hampshire values the
 
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
state's therapeutic program then how
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
does it maintain the program
 
00:19:27.549 --> 00:19:27.559 align:start position:0%
alongside the legal retail sale of
 
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis to
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
adults we'll try to answer these
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
questions throughout the presentation by
 
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
providing an overview of the TCP by
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
introducing the patients who find the
 
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
program critical to their health and
 
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
quality of life and by introducing
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
essential Partners the
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
atc's we'll then move some questions to
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
help establish the importance of
 
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
maintaining the Cannabis program
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
alongside an adult use framework and
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
lastly we'll talk about the proposed
 
00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
franchise model and how a dual
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
regulatory structure can be created
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
that allows the TCP and the atcs to
 
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
maintain the services they provide to
 
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire we're not
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
going to cover the broader public health
 
00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:09.559 align:start position:0%
and behavioral health issues around the
 
00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:11.799 align:start position:0%
use of cannabis at a population level
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
but the department would be happy to
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
come back and have the chance to speak
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
to the commissions about those broad
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
broader issues so with that introduction
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
I invite you to take a take a look at
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
prepared so as we start the slide deck
 
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
and as as Mike prepares to get deeper
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
into this presentation for us three
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
things are really important as we're
 
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
thinking about the viability and the
 
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
importance of the therapeutic cannabis
 
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
program with regards to the department
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
and the more than almost 14,000 people
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
it serves and those three pillars are
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
really around patient safety patient
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
access and patient affordability these
 
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
three themes are going to sort of weave
 
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
through our presentation over the next
 
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
30 minutes or so we encourage you to ask
 
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
questions we're we're anxious to hear
 
00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
hear your thoughts and to be able to
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
explain any go a little bit deeper in
 
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
any one of those areas so again patient
 
00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:10.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
affordability so uh page three page
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
three has the outline we've already gone
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
through the the structure of the
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
presentation for you um and when we
 
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
start on page four uh the therapeutic
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
cannabis program was authorized by the N
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature in 2013 um
 
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
under real quick as the clerk are you
 
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:30.200 align:start position:0%

digitally thank you after the meeting
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you um so yeah the TCP was uh was
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh started uh in 2013 uh New Hampshire
 
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
was the 20th state to legalize cannabis
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
for therapeutic use many have followed
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
in uh after us um and as we know many
 
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
states have uh legalized uh cannabis use
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
for adults um we began issuing registry
 
00:22:04.029 --> 00:22:04.039 align:start position:0%
ID cards to patients in December of 2015
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
and the first dispensary in New
 
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire opened in April of
 
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
2016 uh there was no initial
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation of funds for the
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
Department to build this program uh and
 
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
no general fund dollars go to support
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
this program at all their program is
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
self-funded through patient registration
 
00:22:24.669 --> 00:22:24.679 align:start position:0%
fees and a ATC licensing
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
fees currently we have 14,000 patients
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
and there are seven dispens dispensary
 
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
locations in the state from from a
 
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
structural point of view the program
 
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
when it was originally designed was uh
 
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
bifurcated throughout the Department of
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services there was a
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
registry unit there was a rules unit and
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
none of it was put together we put that
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
together in 2019 18 and put it under the
 
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health Service so we
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
could have one voice and one regulatory
 
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
component right it was split up between
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
an eligibility arm a licensing arm and a
 
00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%
policy arm um spread out throughout the
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
department and bringing that program
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
bringing those elements together in 2018
 
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
uh really set the tone for uh the
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
importance of the program in the
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
department and if I could just ask if
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
you could provide some information right
 
00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:11.799 align:start position:0%
now if a person lives in New Hampshire
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the uh the registry ID card
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
what's the process they have to go
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
through to get that card from the point
 
00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:19.559 align:start position:0%
where they can actually purchase
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
therapeutic can yeah we're going to get
 
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
we're get to get to that in the
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
presentation um just very
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
soon um so the uh the
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
one question on page six um in terms of
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
the growth of the program right now so
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
it looks like obviously there was a
 
00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
large uptick percentage wise in the
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
first few years but the um the curve is
 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
somewhat leveled out recently is that
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
something you expect to maintain like do
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
you have projections from where you
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
think that curve will look like in three
 
00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
years two years five years that is a
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
theme of our presentation okay um you
 
00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:54.919 align:start position:0%
know we uh there was uh there was robust
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
growth in the beginning of the program
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
and growth has slowed dramatically over
 
00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
the past three years um alongside the
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
prolifer proliferation of regional the
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
regional cannabis market so we're seeing
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
um we're not seeing declines in patient
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
registration but we are seeing dramatic
 
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh lowering of growth um and that
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
decline in patient registrations is a
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
Hallmark of states that have uh chosen
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
to legalize adult use uh patient
 
00:24:25.389 --> 00:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
registrations fall we're going to be
 
00:24:26.669 --> 00:24:26.679 align:start position:0%
hearing about this throughout the
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
presentation thank you and I would just
 
00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
keep in mind as well that um part of
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
that steeper slope that you see was as
 
00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:36.279 align:start position:0%
new conditions were added so each time a
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
a larger condition something like
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
chronic pain was added you would see a
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
spike up and so we are at a place right
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
now where we have um a large number of
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
conditions already there it would be to
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
be expected I think regardless of a
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
recreational Market that you'd start to
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
see a slower um like a steadier growth
 
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
just simply because you're not adding
 
00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
eligible and I assume you the answer is
 
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
going to be this is in the presentation
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
but if you have nearly
 
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
14,000 qualifying patients if you had a
 
00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:14.919 align:start position:0%
recreational sale if you allow to
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
recreational sales why is there such a
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
concern that the people receiving this
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
legitimate treatment would stop using
 
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic products and then switch
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
to the recreational
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
Market is in the
 
00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:28.590 align:start position:0%
Market is in the
presentation

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
get through question at the end um
 
00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
patients will choose to self patients
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
will choose to self-medicate patients
 
00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:36.919 align:start position:0%
don't want to be on a state registry
 
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
patients don't want to uh talk to their
 
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
doctor about the program they don't want
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
the application process they don't want
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
the application fee they don't want the
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
doctor visit fee and some patients can
 
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
afford more expensive recreational
 
00:25:54.669 --> 00:25:54.679 align:start position:0%
cannabis and so again a highlight of
 
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
what's to come one of the things to
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
maintain a a therapeu Market that's
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
viable that has the level of um uh
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
product that may not be as have as much
 
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
of a financial incentive that's may not
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
be a commercial product is to think
 
00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
about the ways how how expensive the
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
product is so around taxes and other
 
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
things so that's where we're going to
 
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:15.990 align:start position:0%
things so that's where we're going to
get

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
to thank you yeah so the TCP has uh some
 
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
primary functions it's organized into
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
two units we have a registra a registry
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
unit um three staff process patient
 
00:26:30.389 --> 00:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
applic ations determine eligibility um
 
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:32.919 align:start position:0%
issue cannabis registry ID cards we also
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
have a licensing unit it's made up of
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
one staff whose responsibility is ATC
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
licensing uh in uh compliance and
 
00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
inspection generally speaking the
 
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
program's ongoing goals um reducing
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
barriers to access uh reducing
 
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
administrative burden for both patients
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
in the application process and atcs to
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
get out of the way so that they can do
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
business uh maintaining compliance of
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
the atc's and also increasing product
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
quality and product safety um you should
 
00:27:04.029 --> 00:27:04.039 align:start position:0%
also know that there is a medical
 
00:27:06.269 --> 00:27:06.279 align:start position:0%
oversight board that is associated with
 
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program that
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
was formed in 20 uh that was
 
00:27:13.149 --> 00:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
legislatively authorized in 2018 um in
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
response to the need for clinical
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
oversight of the program membership
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
includes 10 uh uh clinical members
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
representing various Specialties and
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
their purpose is to provide General
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
oversight to the clinical quality and
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
public health related matters of the
 
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
Cannabis program specifically uh they
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
have spent a lot of time and the
 
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:34.360 align:start position:0%
legislative charges to review new
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
conditions and to evaluate current
 
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
medical conditions um for their
 
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.590 align:start position:0%
medical conditions um for their
continued

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
appropriateness um so yes as we were
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
talking about patient enrollment um as
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
of June 30th the end of the fiscal year
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
we have about 14,000 patients on the
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
program uh like we've said we've seen
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
steady uh steady growth for a number of
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
years um significant growth after we
 
00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:01.519 align:start position:0%
after the legislature added chronic pain
 
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
and PTSD at that point um those two
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
conditions alone doubled the the the
 
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.470 align:start position:0%
conditions alone doubled the the the
population

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:14.519 align:start position:0%
roles so with your chart here is there
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
any data on people that have been
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
removed from the program and and can you
 
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
lose your card can you have your
 
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
privileges removed is there a system in
 
00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:23.919 align:start position:0%
place for that uh we don't we don't keep
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
data on the number of people who don't
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
renew their cards
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
so these increases are net increases
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
okay so there potentially could be
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
people that have came off the system but
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
they're still included in in these
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
numbers no these numbers are a snapshot
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
of patient registration on June 30th at
 
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
the end of our state fiscal year this is
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
the data that we use to um populate our
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
annual report um we've had about
 
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
30,000 maybe 35,000 patients over the
 
00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:57.919 align:start position:0%
course of the entire program
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
um and many many many patients choose
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
not to renew um due to them dying or
 
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis is not working for them um or
 
00:29:10.269 --> 00:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
or a variety of other reasons the cost
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
they can't afford it Etc so we don't
 
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
track necessarily or published the
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
number of people who are no longer on
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
the program um uh but this is current
 
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
state um uh population um registration
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
to answer your second question um yeah
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
the department has the authority uh and
 
00:29:29.389 --> 00:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
the respons responsibility of revoking
 
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
uh denying applications um and also
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
revoking cards for uh various violations
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
of the statute um and and we have it is
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
rare but it has
 
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
happened question oh
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
sorry the followup to be to be clear
 
00:29:49.149 --> 00:29:49.159 align:start position:0%
your statement was there's been 35,000
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
30 to 35,000 individual patients over
 
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
the course of the life of the program
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
that have made made access the medical
 
00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis program some of obviously those
 
00:30:00.669 --> 00:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
have Fall Fallen off for various reasons
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
but that's the gross number of New
 
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens that have had access
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
to the program 30 to 35,000 yes I would
 
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
like to confirm that number uh when I
 
00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
send the the the the documents to the
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
the organization um it's not like I said
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
it's not a number we track and publish
 
00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:18.799 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to confirm that number uh my
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
memory says it's about 35,000 thank
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
you um and just to clarify you're you
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
can't distinguish of those 30,000 how
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
many left because they passed away it
 
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
didn't work or they couldn't afford it
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
there's no way to figure out what those
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
might look like there is a program rule
 
00:30:39.389 --> 00:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
uh supported by a um the statute that
 
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
requires um the department to be
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
notified when a patient is
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
deceased uh but it is ex it is
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
impossible to enforce um some patient we
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
we do get calls on a regular basis um
 
00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
when uh when when when patients die uh
 
00:31:00.509 --> 00:31:00.519 align:start position:0%
it's usually when um we send out renewal
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
notices um and and we and we find out
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
that the patients the patients family
 
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
members will call in and say you know
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
can you stop sending us notices to my
 
00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:12.519 align:start position:0%
dead husband say um you know and the
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
other other reasons why we we have no
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
way of accessing patients um who other
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
patients who have left the program for
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
any other reason so no we don't collect
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
that data okay
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
thanks yes good morning uh do you have
 
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
any records or data on uh the number of
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
people who have been denied a license in
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
your program and the reasons why there
 
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
was a denial if
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
any I don't have that today I can tell
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
you that it's very few patients who are
 
00:31:51.789 --> 00:31:51.799 align:start position:0%
denied um but we can I can find that out
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
um it is it is remarkably few patients
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
who are denied the department does not
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
do a clinical review we are not
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
clinicians um our eligibility
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
determination is largely a paperwork um
 
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
eligibility process where uh if we if if
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
the application uh elements are complete
 
00:32:14.509 --> 00:32:14.519 align:start position:0%
the doctor has signed off um in you know
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
on a three p you know three-page form
 
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
it's a cumbersome application process um
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
people are approved it is very rare when
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh when when patients are denied the
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
program there are a great number of
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
people who apply to the program and
 
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
never complete their application process
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh they would be in incomplete status uh
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
they have the it has the effect of not
 
00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
getting a card um but they are not
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
denied based on fraud or uh some program
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
violation follow question Mr shair so
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
would it be fair to say then that the
 
00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:48.519 align:start position:0%
vast majority of applicants um receive
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
permission for therapeutic marijuana
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
would that be fair to say yes it is and
 
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
one more followup question Mr chair and
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
I would just qualify that by the the
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
applicants who complete an application
 
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
with their provider signature on it uh
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
and and is it true that to obtain a card
 
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
that a doctor does not write or a
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
medical practitioner does not write a
 
00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
prescription because that's um would be
 
00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:17.720 align:start position:0%
uh illegal uh based on their medical
 
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
license and their DEA registration is
 
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
that correct that is true New Hampshire
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
law does not require a provider to
 
00:33:29.389 --> 00:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
prescribe cannabis newshire Law requires
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
certifying medical providers to certify
 
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
that one of their patients has been
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with one of the qualifying
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
conditions listed in state law so then
 
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's fair to say then doctors only
 
00:33:44.909 --> 00:33:44.919 align:start position:0%
certifying that a patient has a
 
00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
condition and is not prescribing uh
 
00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
cannabis but only indicating a condition
 
00:33:55.149 --> 00:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
because the practitioner is prescribed
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
and it cannot issue prescri prescrition
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
for cannabis is that correct cannabis is
 
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
not a f FDA approved medication
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
currently it's a schedule one uh
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
controlled substance and providers as
 
00:34:08.829 --> 00:34:08.839 align:start position:0%
you say would
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
be it would be
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
illegal to prescribe an FDA thank you Mr
 
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919 align:start position:0%
chair control substance that is schedule
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
one um so right as we've seen um patient
 
00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
growth has flat LED um uh in 2020 there
 
00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
were 200 there were 2400 net new
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
patients in 2020 there were 500 net new
 
00:34:40.589 --> 00:34:40.599 align:start position:0%
patients so over the past three years
 
00:34:44.109 --> 00:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
we've seen a a steep decline in growth
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh caregivers um caregivers are are
 
00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
people friends and family who apply for
 
00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
cards and are allowed to legally possess
 
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis on behalf of their patient um
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
there right now there's almost a
 
00:34:59.790 --> 00:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
thousand um in 2023 that number doubled
 
00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
from about 500 to almost a thousand
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
because of a legislative change that
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
removed uh administrative barrier to
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
accessing caregiver status and that was
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh the legislature removing the
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
requirement for a federal fingerprinting
 
00:35:14.109 --> 00:35:14.119 align:start position:0%
and background check they maintain the
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
requirement for no felony conviction but
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
they remove the uh the requirement for a
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
federal background check um caregivers
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
cannot cultivate nobody can cultivate
 
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis in uh New Hampshire unlike in
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
many other states especially Maine which
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
has a robust caregiver uh model that is
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
built on uh caregiver
 
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
cultivation um so and the other uh
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
registration category we have is medical
 
00:35:41.069 --> 00:35:41.079 align:start position:0%
providers um currently about, 1300
 
00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
medical providers have certified at
 
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
least one current patient um over the
 
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
course of the program just like patient
 
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
numbers you know we've seen you know uh
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
far more um maybe up to 2,000 again I'd
 
00:35:55.309 --> 00:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
have to confirm that number um but as of
 
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
as June 30th uh 1300 patients have
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
certified um a a patient that growth has
 
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
been you know modest maybe a 100 per
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
years um if you go to the next slide we
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
get a great picture of what our patients
 
00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:17.079 align:start position:0%
look like um the majority of patients
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
are in their 50s and 60s um we uh that's
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
that's an area where you would expect to
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
see the uh you know the the disease
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
State or the condition State um chronic
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
pain is is a very you know Common
 
00:36:33.069 --> 00:36:33.079 align:start position:0%
condition amongst that age population so
 
00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:34.839 align:start position:0%
just just to clarify the scope of what
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
the commi the commission's covering here
 
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
uh is to study the purpose of proposing
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
legislation uh for State controlled
 
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
sales of the Cannabis and canvas
 
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
products I understand that the
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
therapeutic side of things is very
 
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
complicated industry and and there's a
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
lot of regulations and I understand a
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
lot of that's in the slides we can
 
00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
review that but the main focus what we
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
would want to hear about is if there was
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
retail how would you incorporate the two
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh some of the history and I understand
 
00:37:09.309 --> 00:37:09.319 align:start position:0%
this I see patient testimonials U I
 
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
think if you don't mind for the sake of
 
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
efficiency we kind of want to get to the
 
00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:16.599 align:start position:0%
meat of why we're what the scope of the
 
00:37:20.349 --> 00:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
commission is certainly we can we can um
 
00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
Quicken our pace and and Skip some of
 
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
these slides testing labeling we we
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
understand this those are existing
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
regulations already in place but how
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
would you incorporate all that into a
 
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.230 align:start position:0%
would you incorporate all that into a
retail

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
retail
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
Market maybe Jump Ahead to like page 22
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
which is where we start getting into how
 
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
medical industry interacts with the
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
model our our attempt here is to
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
establish the value of the program and
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
the importance of maintaining the
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
therapeutic program um and and in and
 
00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
yes certainly jump ahead but I I I do
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
want to impress upon you know the the
 
00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
the commission that um we have a we have
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
a highly regulated mature program that
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
has you know that has been doing this
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
for seven years it's very important to
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
patients um we have uh strict
 
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
requirements on testing packaging um uh
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
product safety um and these are these
 
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:23.720 align:start position:0%
are important things to consider um for
 
00:38:25.309 --> 00:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
any commission member who may be
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
thinking that well those questions that
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
I started with which is why do we even
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
need this program um so I I I want I we
 
00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
did want to emphasize this I I urge you
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
all to take uh take your time and look
 
00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:39.079 align:start position:0%
through the slides to to to to absorb
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
that message through the slides that
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
we'll be uh that we'll be skipping so
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
just just to get right to the point
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
I if there was a retail Market whether
 
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
it's private retail the franchise model
 
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
complete State
 
00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
Control there's no intention of the at
 
00:38:58.349 --> 00:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
least on my end to for this to make the
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
therapeutic industry insolvent so the
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
idea is if you're going to how would you
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
incorporate that into legislation so
 
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
happen it's my understanding that the
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic industry believes that
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
they would lose some of their patients
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
to the retail
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
Market which could already be happening
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
I mean if there people buying out of
 
00:39:24.309 --> 00:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
state whether it's Maine or mass
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but what's the best thing
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
that we can do any suggestions on how to
 
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
allow everyone to coexist in in harmony
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
so if I might back up to one question
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
prior to that and that is what are the
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
differences between an adult use model
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
and a therapeutic model um to kind of
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
preview the the transitioning into you
 
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
know what do we suggest for uh uh for
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
integration or dual regulatory structure
 
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
a little a little leway you know to to
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
to to talk about the fundamental
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
differences between between and adult
 
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
use model um uh so one is access to
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
therapeutic products um the therapeutic
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
programs and this is this is page 16 so
 
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
just a just a just a few few additional
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
slides if I might uh
 
00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.790 align:start position:0%
slides if I might uh
Senator

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
um the therapeutic products um and
 
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
strains are products that are not sold
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
in uh recreational markets uh their low
 
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
THC strains and products their CBD Rich
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
strains their ratio products products
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
that have both THC and CBD they have
 
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic routes of administration
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
like suppositories these are
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
non-profitable you know uh these are
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
non-profitable uh product type that
 
00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
would never be sold in a in a
 
00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
recreational uh market and so that
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
that's contributes to the reason why
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
it's important to maintain you know
 
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
these uh these this this model um
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutic programs allow higher
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
potency products higher dose per serving
 
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
products because those higher uh
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
potencies and higher doses are needed
 
00:40:59.550 --> 00:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
for Effective symptom
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
management uh access to therapeutic
 
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
education about cannabis which is not
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
expected you know in a recreational Mo
 
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh model in the therapeutic World
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
being high is an adverse side effect uh
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
the Mantra is go low start slow uh the
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
atc's uh have a critical educational
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
message of what is the minimum amount of
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis necessary to achieve a desired
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
effect these are not the kind of
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
education that is going to be offered in
 
00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
Market why do you let me ask this the
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
person that's providing the education in
 
00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic facility when someone
 
00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
goes there what is their training and
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
background uh the state does not
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
prescribe a training model or mechanism
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
for them um they are experts in their
 
00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
own products uh and and they uh much of
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
their much of their training is uh
 
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
experiential based on the the the the
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
testimonials and the and the
 
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
effectiveness surveys that they run with
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
patients uh they're they know which
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
products help other patients and they
 
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
sit down with patients and um and and
 
00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
identify products that may be useful it
 
00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
is trial and error uh but to answer your
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
question no there's no formal training
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
that the state requires uh for for for
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
that for those
 
00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:31.720 align:start position:0%
staff thank you uh so I I you said it
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
and I just want to make sure I make sure
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
so which of these products here are
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
you're saying that are not sold in a
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
recreational because they're not
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
profitable that that that they're not
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
did people wouldn't buy them you said
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
something about that there's not enough
 
00:42:49.309 --> 00:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
money to be made or you you use that I
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
mean one one good example would be
 
00:42:53.309 --> 00:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
suppositories it's not a recreational
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
product but some people can't some
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
people simply are too too sick to be
 
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
able to take cannabis in any other form
 
00:43:04.829 --> 00:43:04.839 align:start position:0%
um the others are strains of th strains
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
of cannabis that have under 10% of THC
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
um it's not a recreational product um
 
00:43:16.349 --> 00:43:16.359 align:start position:0%
and you would not find uh strains that
 
00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:20.559 align:start position:0%
have that low amount of THC in a recre I
 
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
thought the some states they like
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it's five it has to be 5%
 
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
or less no that's uh what what to
 
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:31.240 align:start position:0%
clarify what that is is uh milligrams of
 
00:43:34.549 --> 00:43:34.559 align:start position:0%
THC per serving okay so a fruit chew or
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
a lazing in Massachusetts can't have
 
00:43:41.549 --> 00:43:41.559 align:start position:0%
more than five milligrams per piece of
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
um of products um what I'm talking about
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
is actual strains um and and products uh
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis infused products that have
 
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
higher doses of CBD um higher uh uh
 
00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
percentages of CBG um and and and
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
whatnot and these are non-med or these
 
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
are non-recreational
 
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids right but that but some
 
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
having let's say one%
 
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
milligram is is that available in in
 
00:44:10.549 --> 00:44:10.559 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I mean you said 5% or less
 
00:44:10.559 --> 00:44:11.390 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I mean you said 5% or less
I

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
mean uh yes I believe that there are low
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
dose lowow low dose milligrams per
 
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
serving in mass m mints are a typical
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
you know uh product just talking about
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
the amount of THC that was you I guess
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's a little confusing to me Senator
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
Lang bring the conversation back a
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
little bit so we don't wander field
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
farfield the I don't think whether it
 
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
was 639 and the amendments to 639 or
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
1598 has the intention of doing away
 
00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
with the medical cannabis program I
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
think the question is the interaction of
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
the two programs and to make sure that
 
00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
if we want to allow things like the THC
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
the the um the at atcs to operate a
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
retail store as a franchise model
 
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
are there changes that are necessary in
 
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
statute because I understand the atcs
 
00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
have to be nonprofit and there are
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
things around that meod so I guess to
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
bring the focus back and and what I was
 
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:07.480 align:start position:0%
hoping for out of this conversation is I
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we find those
 
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
crossovers where we put a law in place
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
but there's another law somewhere else
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
that makes it so atcs can't can't open a
 
00:45:17.549 --> 00:45:17.559 align:start position:0%
retail Market that'll help them keep
 
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
their medical Market viable as well so
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
again if we can bring the conversation
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
into that area as where the interaction
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
is between 639 and 159 8 and the medical
 
00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis program where those two might
 
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:31.720 align:start position:0%
cross and how we can craft legislation
 
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
to protect any conflicts thank you for
 
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
that redirect Senator Lang and represent
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
Kay have question yeah so I was I was
 
00:45:41.549 --> 00:45:41.559 align:start position:0%
reading in one of the slides we skipped
 
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:43.720 align:start position:0%
over you have you're allowed to have
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
four of these locations in the state is
 
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
that how is that what you have state law
 
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
allows for a maximum of four ATC
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
licenses those licenses have been
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
awarded to three not for profit entities
 
00:46:00.549 --> 00:46:00.559 align:start position:0%
so one entity has two of those licenses
 
00:46:02.589 --> 00:46:02.599 align:start position:0%
the law also prescribes the number of
 
00:46:05.309 --> 00:46:05.319 align:start position:0%
dispensary locations that are allowed in
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
the state and that is uh originally that
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
was four um and in 2018 and 2019 the
 
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
legislature increase that number uh to
 
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh to eight So currently there are seven
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.549 --> 00:46:24.559 align:start position:0%
pending have you seen in other states
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
that have have a both recreational
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
program and a therapeutic
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
program have you seen the therapeutic
 
00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
program patient registration declines
 
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
are a Hallmark of States who have a
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
medical program and then move to
 
00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
legalization um preliminary data shows
 
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
15 out of the 17 states that have
 
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
legalized that have publicly available
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
reliable data about patient
 
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
registrations have seen a decline of
 
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
average of
 
00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
31% um if you take out the uh the number
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
of new markets the ones that have just
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
been uh um that they're not matured um
 
00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
that that decline goes up to 40% but the
 
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
range of declines that have experienced
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
by States you know are go up you know
 
00:47:27.549 --> 00:47:27.559 align:start position:0%
from the the from the tens to the
 
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
90s um if we take the average of 30%
 
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
decrease then 14,000
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
patients I'm not going to attempt to do
 
00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
the math in my head but uh it is it is
 
00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
it is expected that patients will leave
 
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
the program um on uh if there's a
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
legalization available in uh New
 
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if I could just CL clarify one
 
00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
I I I don't think this was answered so
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
you have a person that works in the
 
00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
therapeutic center who is an expert
 
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
apparently on on the whatever they're
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
Distributing all right now at any
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
nutritional supplement store you know
 
00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
think of like a vitamin shop GN C same
 
00:48:09.069 --> 00:48:09.079 align:start position:0%
thing the people working there are
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
selling supplements for all sorts of
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
different ailments whether it's immunity
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
Health joint health protein shakes
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
whatever that that the last time I went
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
to one of those stores the person
 
00:48:21.309 --> 00:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
working there uh didn't graduate from
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
high school yet so they knew the
 
00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
products they were selling they may not
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
know the reason why this boosts your
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
immune system or why this will you know
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
make you stronger help you recover but
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
they know what the product does so I'm
 
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to if if you're banking
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
on the fact that people are relying on
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
what the person in the store is saying
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh in other therapeutic products that un
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
relate to cannabis I I think the
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
consumers aren't
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily as Reliant as you may think
 
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
I understand there may be more
 
00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
complicated medical issues to some of
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
the patients here but to make the entire
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
model reliant on the expert of the
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
person in the basically making the
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
transaction I'm trying to figure out
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
what are they bringing to the table here
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's keeping everyone going there and
 
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
how many of those patients are even
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
relying on that I mean if you have a
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
history of migraines I think you know
 
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
after the first interaction with them
 
00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:14.839 align:start position:0%
you understand what you're doing right
 
00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
so they may end up going to the
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
recreational Market anyway because they
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
know what they
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
need so I don't know that we know that I
 
00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:25.160 align:start position:0%
think what we find again with the vast
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
um number of different conditions that
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
are here of whether you're have cancer
 
00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
whether you have chronic pain whether
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
you have an immune other immune system
 
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
so to your point the folks that work
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
there have experience with the market I
 
00:49:40.829 --> 00:49:40.839 align:start position:0%
I think your analogy to GNC is is
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
interesting but I do know that those um
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
atcs also have clinical representation
 
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
in their in their organizations that
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
help inform that it makes it harder in
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
um a when we have uh that the Cannabis
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
is federal L illegal that you can't have
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
broader discussions you have fewer
 
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities for sort of credentialed
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
education so I don't know that comparing
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
that always makes sense um I do know
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
that one of the Hallmarks of the program
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
also is to try and connect with the
 
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
medical provider and when the program
 
00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:13.960 align:start position:0%
works best the patient is working both
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
with their ATC and with their own
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
provider in order to get to the right
 
00:50:20.589 --> 00:50:20.599 align:start position:0%
results I to to the point though I want
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we hurry up In
 
00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
fairness can you there has been some
 
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
scient ific research or studies on the
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
benef potential benefits of cannabis so
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
they say that you can't compare it to a
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
a protein shake there been they all list
 
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
that on the products too what studies
 
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
have been done on what supplements so I
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
think there's been enough that they at
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
least have a basis for the
 
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation I'm just trying to figure
 
00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:45.799 align:start position:0%
out do we really believe that relying on
 
00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:47.559 align:start position:0%
the expertise of the person working
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
there is essential to the sustainability
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
of the therapeutic industry that's what
 
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get at I don't I don't
 
00:50:55.789 --> 00:50:55.799 align:start position:0%
believe it is I'm just trying to I I
 
00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
think it plays an important part to to
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
the quantity I I can't give you the
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
quantity of what to what degree
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
especially when you have people who are
 
00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
naive to cannabis use coming in you have
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
a 70-year-old woman who hasn't perhaps
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
had cannabis ever or last time in 1969
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
they're riant on some information from
 
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
someone else who has experience what we
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
would like to talk to and to your point
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
earlier is really about the Dual
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory structure about the ideas
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
that we have around how the two can work
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
together and I think first of all if we
 
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
sort of jump to 26 then um some of those
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
and Mike can jump in here is
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
understanding in your legislation that
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
there's clear language that establishes
 
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
that the atcs are permitted to apply for
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
the recreational market so just to get
 
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
to financial Li um Level Playing ground
 
00:51:45.549 --> 00:51:45.559 align:start position:0%
that we want to make sure that there's
 
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
some opportunity for them to play I
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
think we are looking at ideas around
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
separate and specific rul making
 
00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
authority to allow use for these dual
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
use or um integrated licenses we have
 
00:52:00.789 --> 00:52:00.799 align:start position:0%
organizations that are already set up
 
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
they've already invested in the capital
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
in their structure in their gross sites
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that that's
 
00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
acknowledged and that there's
 
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities in the legislation to
 
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
align regulations and establish some
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
accommodations and finally very
 
00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:15.559 align:start position:0%
specifically we want to harmonize
 
00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
Laboratory Testing requirements to
 
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
ensure safety there's opportunity in our
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
current rule statute and rules to update
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
those Laboratory Testing and I think it
 
00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me make it all the same
 
00:52:28.349 --> 00:52:28.359 align:start position:0%
with the recreational Market take it
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
from there yeah so um there are some
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
elements of the uh so generally speaking
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
the franchise model that was proposed by
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission a couple weeks ago
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
um appears to be a model that would
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
allow for uh the atcs to enter the
 
00:52:46.349 --> 00:52:46.359 align:start position:0%
market they you know they they they
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
stated that atcs would be welcome to
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
apply for any license type um that they
 
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:53.799 align:start position:0%
choose to like anyone else you know to
 
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
to to piggy back on what Trisha has said
 
00:52:58.030 --> 00:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
is that um but they're not like everyone
 
00:52:59.549 --> 00:52:59.559 align:start position:0%
else because they're currently operating
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
under a regulatory structure um in
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
statute and in in in in rule um some of
 
00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
the elements that we um that we see that
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
were part of that presentation um
 
00:53:14.349 --> 00:53:14.359 align:start position:0%
include um like include branding you
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
know uh New Hampshire uh cannabis
 
00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
branding where we would ask uh
 
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
consideration of you know an allowance
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
to maintain their current brand patients
 
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:25.799 align:start position:0%
need to know that their going to the
 
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
same store that they've been going to
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
for the past seven years um and so it is
 
00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
there are opportunities for integrating
 
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
the the New Hampshire cannabis brand
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
into their current branding um but we
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
would ask for uh consideration of
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
allowing them to maintain um uh their
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
their own brand um another thing that
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
was stated uh a couple weeks ago was uh
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
with regard to retail locations um in
 
00:53:55.789 --> 00:53:55.799 align:start position:0%
locals o which have only in which have a
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
currently have a liquor store well we
 
00:53:59.670 --> 00:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
would encourage an evaluation of the
 
00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:03.799 align:start position:0%
current retail locations of the atcs um
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
for Align purposes we know that Chai
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
Chester which has a dispensary does not
 
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
have a liquor store so that becomes you
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
know uh an area of of consideration you
 
00:54:17.069 --> 00:54:17.079 align:start position:0%
know perhaps most importantly um we
 
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:19.480 align:start position:0%
would we would say that the 15%
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
franchise fee that's proposed by The
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission um we would like an
 
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
exploration of our opportunity
 
00:54:28.109 --> 00:54:28.119 align:start position:0%
opportunities to exempt therapeutic
 
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
sales from that 15% uh of fee so these
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
are just some of the examples based on
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
the presentation we heard that that we
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
would encourage uh the commission to
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
look at when we are align when when
 
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
they're wri when you all are writing the
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
legislation um in terms of a more
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
granular level you know what
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
we're what we're what we're looking at
 
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
is once we have a a draft of what this
 
00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:57.510 align:start position:0%
is once we have a a draft of what this
commission

00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
proposes we the department need to
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
crosswalk that Proposal with RSA
 
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
126x um to uh to figure out where there
 
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
are barriers um that the it is is going
 
00:55:14.349 --> 00:55:14.359 align:start position:0%
to be important to remove barriers
 
00:55:16.829 --> 00:55:16.839 align:start position:0%
remove areas of conflict and in areas
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
where we can't remove areas of conflict
 
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:21.160 align:start position:0%
to create specific accommodations for
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
the atc's so that they can enter the
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
market um it would be very easy for
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
barriers to exist to say well if you
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
can't meet that requirement then you
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
then you can't enter the market and so
 
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
that's what we that's what we would ask
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
is you know to give us an opportunity
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
and the atc's an opportunity to
 
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
crosswalk whatever legislation uh draft
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
is proposed um you know and and and
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
provide suggestions on areas for
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
alignment and accommodation and I think
 
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
that there are opportunities both with
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
whatever draft that you will propose for
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
conversation in there and then also just
 
00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
looking at 126 X that there may be
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
changes that we suggest should go in
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
there Laboratory Testing is a great
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
example where we want to modernize that
 
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
and harmonize it with whatever it is
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
that you propose there's also something
 
00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
in our current um you know around not
 
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
for-profit status we don't have an
 
00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
opinion on that but it is something to
 
00:56:15.029 --> 00:56:15.039 align:start position:0%
consider around whether we maintain not
 
00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
for-profit status for the therapeutic
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
Market I just want to clarify it and I'm
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
going to reach over to commissioner Mal
 
00:56:25.789 --> 00:56:25.799 align:start position:0%
over there um my understanding is that
 
00:56:28.589 --> 00:56:28.599 align:start position:0%
from from your presentation that the
 
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
locations weren't set based on where
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
liquor store was it was just a total
 
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
number of dispens of dispensaries
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call them was set
 
00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
by the total number of liquor stores is
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
that correct that's correct and it
 
00:56:41.029 --> 00:56:41.039 align:start position:0%
wasn't your intention on a 15% franchise
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
fee to require medical dispensaries to
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
pay that fee it was only for any retail
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
version that the dispensary may open
 
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
they would be required for the retail
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
sales within that to pay the 15% that's
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
correct thank you chief
 
00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.789 align:start position:0%
correct thank you chief
yes

00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:57.799 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
um what is the gross uh cost of
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
Regulation and running the department
 
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
this program to the taxpayers of the
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire
 
00:57:11.789 --> 00:57:11.799 align:start position:0%
currently zero zero like I said uh
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
earlier there is no general fund
 
00:57:15.549 --> 00:57:15.559 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the support of the
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
program the the program is 100% entirely
 
00:57:22.109 --> 00:57:22.119 align:start position:0%
supported by patient fees and ATC
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
licensing fees and has been since 2013
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
you're an employee of DHHS correct I am
 
00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
and your salary is paid by whom the
 
00:57:33.549 --> 00:57:33.559 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program and how
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
many employees are 100% devoted to the
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program whose
 
00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
salaries are paid by DHHS if you know
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
currently five and do you know what the
 
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
gross costs of that compensation uh in
 
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
module for office space I do not have
 
00:57:49.789 --> 00:57:49.799 align:start position:0%
that number in front of me right now but
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
I can provide our uh our annual budget
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
to you in a in a followup so would it be
 
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
fair to say then that all the products
 
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
if this commission were to recommend all
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
the products that currently are
 
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
available in the TCP
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
program could be required under a retail
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
program that it would be a net savings
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:58:16.109 --> 00:58:16.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayer uh by simply folding this
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
program into the retail program and
 
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
making requirements to maintain the same
 
00:58:23.069 --> 00:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
products and the same type of products
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
correct no taxpayers don't pay for this
 
00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
this this uh
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
program no I I think what what what I'm
 
00:58:34.589 --> 00:58:34.599 align:start position:0%
saying is is that this the commission
 
00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
could promulgate rules or require or
 
00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
recommend I should say rules and
 
00:58:41.029 --> 00:58:41.039 align:start position:0%
regulations that would require the same
 
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
products that you say are not available
 
00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:45.559 align:start position:0%
in retail stores elsewhere that would be
 
00:58:49.029 --> 00:58:49.039 align:start position:0%
required to be sold in retail stores in
 
00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
by the franchisees in New Hampshire that
 
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
would be possible correct that would be
 
00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
a policy decision for this commission it
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
would not be a recommended policy
 
00:58:59.069 --> 00:58:59.079 align:start position:0%
consideration from the perspective of um
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program uh the K
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
atc's and uh patients who who require
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
therapeutic products require therapeutic
 
00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
education um there's an access issue as
 
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:11.720 align:start position:0%
well where the program serves uh the
 
00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutic program serves people who
 
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:17.720 align:start position:0%
are under 21 and there no medic no adult
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
use Market allows a population of under
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
21 to enter their stores you know we've
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
got about 200 patients
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
um under 21 they would be shut out of
 
00:59:29.069 --> 00:59:29.079 align:start position:0%
the program without you know without the
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the at the ATC system and
 
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
the TCP system you know kids get cancer
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
too you know and and it would be it it
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
would be problematic to exclude them
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
from access to uh this critical
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
alternative therapy and is it also fair
 
00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
to say then that the same people that
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
you described as having experiential but
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
no formal education with respect to um
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis that work in these
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
stores could also be employed by retail
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
stores uh would that be fair to
 
01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
say of
 
01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
course so uh in essence then all the
 
01:00:09.549 --> 01:00:09.559 align:start position:0%
products as well as the Personnel that
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
are currently employed uh in atcs could
 
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
also be employed and provided in a uh
 
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
commercial retail program if the
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
commission were to so recommend and the
 
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
state were to so adopt one would that be
 
01:00:24.029 --> 01:00:24.039 align:start position:0%
correct that would not be a recommended
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
approach from the Department's
 
01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:26.799 align:start position:0%
perspective but but it is possible
 
01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
correct it is it is possible with uh
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
accommodations that we've talked about
 
01:00:35.069 --> 01:00:35.079 align:start position:0%
in terms of minor and under 21 access
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
Senate again sen again you recognize
 
01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um just refresh me if you will
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to remember about six years
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
ago and we had a earlier marijuana
 
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
commission did we not set up the atc's
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
so they would never compete in an open
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
retail Market wasn't that one of the
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
promises that it would be an unfair
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
advantage to the commercial Market that
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
you guys would already get set up so I
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
thought you had promise that you would
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
never go retail and that you were going
 
01:01:04.589 --> 01:01:04.599 align:start position:0%
to serve a niche market and that the two
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
worlds would never meet do I the
 
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
department the I was in those I was in
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
the gallery in those uh the previous
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
commission meetings uh we were not
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
members of that commission um I so we
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
never made the promise that we would
 
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
never we never made that commitment um
 
01:01:24.589 --> 01:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
publicly and I don't recall that uh
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
commitment being being discussed um it
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
was discussed I just don't remember I
 
01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
didn't remember that you weren't a part
 
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
yet okay thank you
 
01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh we're going to surprise you here
 
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
let first start out let's first start
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
out with the concept that you can only
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
have one
 
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
master so therefore the question is can
 
01:01:50.109 --> 01:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
the ATC
 
01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:55.039 align:start position:0%
program operate as it is now Ru making
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
done through
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
HHS uh nonprofit status so that it
 
01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:04.279 align:start position:0%
maintains the the low cost for the
 
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
product we keep everything exactly the
 
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
same and no is not about retail at all
 
01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:15.559 align:start position:0%
retail is a totally different
 
01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
statute totally different
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
customer totally different
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
Marketplace that we make sure
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
that we don't create the conflicts
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
clearly the department can uh when they
 
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
see the uh Liquor Commission come up
 
01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
with new rules about testing you
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
certainly can have a hearings and decide
 
01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
to have the
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
same that's already in statute so if we
 
01:02:47.549 --> 01:02:47.559 align:start position:0%
just say right now atcs don't have to
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
pay the 15% atc's continue to operate
 
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
just as they are just they if they want
 
01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:57.039 align:start position:0%
to come forward and say we want to
 
01:02:59.230 --> 01:02:59.240 align:start position:0%
expand in the future they can still do
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
that can always come back to the
 
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
legislature and say we want more stores
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
more locations more whatever but why not
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
just treat this as leave you alone let
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
you do your thing you clearly uh are
 
01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
doing a market Niche there's a unique
 
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
customers who want your product and
 
01:03:20.829 --> 01:03:20.839 align:start position:0%
therefore it should be competitive uh
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
the model that we have already created
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
to say is oh no the state's creating
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
another model that's going to hurt
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
us is only because the customer has
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
chosen to switch we the legislature
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
should not do anything to change the ATC
 
01:03:41.789 --> 01:03:41.799 align:start position:0%
program just as it
 
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
agree well Mike is deciding whether or
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
not he agrees um I I
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
think I think that is that is certainly
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
an approach that you can take what I
 
01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:56.839 align:start position:0%
think we could also direct you to
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
there's some ver there's some lessons
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
from the Vermont model so our neighbor
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
to the west they've developed an
 
01:04:04.029 --> 01:04:04.039 align:start position:0%
integrated license they have separate
 
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
license categories available to only
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
existing centers they allowed
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic entities to apply for one
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
single vertical uh vertically integrated
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
license and and so that's another path
 
01:04:20.269 --> 01:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
that you could consider but that would
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
grire them then have to pay the 15% if
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
they chose the other model model but
 
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
this model because you're a nonprofit
 
01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
because you are who you are because the
 
01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
statute is working
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
right why would we mess with that why
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
don't we just leave you alone let you do
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
your thing and uh and if there's a
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
problem in the future the legislature
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
can fix it but I at this point we're
 
01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
going to exempt you from the 15% because
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
you're different targeting a different
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
customer the customer is required to
 
01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
have to have a a piece of paper signed
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
by a doctor where the retail customers
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
don't it's a totally different model and
 
01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
if I can just maybe just simplify the
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
statement you're making basically are
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
are you saying that no one's asking the
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
atc's to enter the retail Market they're
 
01:05:14.349 --> 01:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
asking to enter the retail market and
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
therefore they should be subject to the
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
retail regulations if they choose to
 
01:05:21.549 --> 01:05:21.559 align:start position:0%
stay out of the retail market then it's
 
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
business as usual agreed Senator B other
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
states have other states have considered
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
these you know these same questions as
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
we're considering right now and um and
 
01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:33.640 align:start position:0%
there are a number of different uh uh
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
approaches um the Vermont model you know
 
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
allowed at their their equivalent of the
 
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
atc's to apply for an integrated license
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
um other states have chosen to uh create
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
a new agency within their state um you
 
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:51.799 align:start position:0%
know with uh with room for both the
 
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
adult use uh model and the recreation
 
01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
model other states are do are
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
considering exactly what you know New
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's considering you know with
 
01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
regard to The Liquor Commission you know
 
01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
being responsible for adult use sales um
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
and another agency like the Department
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
of Health um uh regulating um uh the um
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
the the Medical Market um most of those
 
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
States Al if not all of those states
 
01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
have allowed the medical entities to
 
01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
enter the me uh the adult use Market um
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons but one of them
 
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
to I'll I'll I'll pause there the the
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
the commission the commission has the
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
charge to solicit input from the atc's
 
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
um and the atc's can speak much more
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
clearly and directly about their
 
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
business model you know they can speak
 
01:06:51.269 --> 01:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
about at what level of patient
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
participation will result in staff
 
01:06:57.269 --> 01:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
leaving reduction of services reduction
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
of products reduction of the patient
 
01:07:02.029 --> 01:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
affordability programs Etc you know
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
they'd be much more uh um Adept at
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
giving you an inside look at their um
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
their particular industry and the risks
 
01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
of not being allowed to enter this
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
Market we're not we're not saying that
 
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
the commission has to go with that model
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do with many with
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
most of the slides that we did not get
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
to is that what happens when patient
 
01:07:28.029 --> 01:07:28.039 align:start position:0%
registrations decline we have a weaker
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
ATC system and which has the potential
 
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
for disrupting the service to those
 
01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:39.799 align:start position:0%
patients who absolutely need the ATC
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
model in order to continue accessing
 
01:07:47.069 --> 01:07:47.079 align:start position:0%
these products so all of the models
 
01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
apparently are on the table with this
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
commission um and we're here to give
 
01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
Prov provide information we're happy to
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
provide more information and come back
 
01:07:59.470 --> 01:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
as we as this commission gets closer to
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
what it decides as a uh as as a desired
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
model for New
 
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yeah fundamentally I mean it
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
goes back to those three things from the
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that there's access
 
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
to the product certainly you want to
 
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
have a competitive environment where
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
those entities decide to stay open
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
because if you create a system in which
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
it is impossible for them to keep the
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
doors open then it closes and the
 
01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
product goes away so really it goes back
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
to we want safe product we want it to be
 
01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
accessible we want it to be affordable
 
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
we look to you as the commission to to
 
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
set the tone and set the direction of
 
01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
where you go and we're happy to
 
01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:37.759 align:start position:0%
crosswalk 126k with whatever Direction
 
01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:40.359 align:start position:0%
you go do you want us to make the the
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
first move we were ask it would be
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
helpful if you just told us how to do it
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
and we got right to the point that would
 
01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
save us probably one full day of
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.799 --> 01:09:17.309 align:start position:0%
 
jren

01:09:17.309 --> 01:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you that's a that's a great
 
01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
question and that would be part of the
 
01:09:25.709 --> 01:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
alignment of Regulation um uh when we
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
crosswalk the the the proposal and the
 
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
the 126x which is the therapeutic
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
program we we would Advocate and for
 
01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.749 align:start position:0%
program we we would Advocate and for
consideration

01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:09:41.229 --> 01:09:41.239 align:start position:0%
of consideration of of certain
 
01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
principles and a prioritization of
 
01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
Service delivery to our patients you
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
know separate uh separate counters say
 
01:09:53.789 --> 01:09:53.799 align:start position:0%
um uh for sale um lower prices
 
01:09:56.590 --> 01:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
guaranteed therapeutic inventory
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
maintaining or at at at the least
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
maintaining the breadth of therapeutic
 
01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
products um you know and increasing them
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
ensuring a lower price for therapeutic
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
products these are the kinds of things
 
01:10:13.950 --> 01:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
that we uh the department would have as
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
priorities for a dual use or a dual
 
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
regulatory structure model where the
 
01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
atcs are serving both populations um
 
01:10:23.709 --> 01:10:23.719 align:start position:0%
States uh there there are examples
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the country where these kinds
 
01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
of requirements are in uh state law um
 
01:10:30.669 --> 01:10:30.679 align:start position:0%
that we don't have to reinvent the wheel
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
here on on maintaining um that balance
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
of a priorization of serving therapeutic
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
patients if the atcs are allowed to also
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
sell to a retail
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
market so yeah we we be I'm very
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
interested in going through that list of
 
01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:51.640 align:start position:0%
uh priorities for prioritizing you know
 
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis patients you know with you and
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
the commission as we get to a granular
 
01:10:59.550 --> 01:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
legislation just same one after the
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
other so the same way thank you Mr chair
 
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
so uh fair to say then just going back
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
that ultimately every state that has uh
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
legalized the sale of retail cannabis if
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
there was a predecessor therapeutic can
 
01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
program uh it was significantly dimin
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
diminished if not um um
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.550 align:start position:0%
 
eom

01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
eom
 
01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
I can prev perhaps te up um you know
 
01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
some of the information that you will
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.830 align:start position:0%
 
commission

01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
proval data on this question so I urge
 
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
you to
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
um he fromc directly they will be
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely primed to provide direct
 
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
specific examples of
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
and the experience of other states thank
 
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
you uh for your answer uh it open source
 
01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
information certainly indicates that the
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
main therapeutic canvas industry has all
 
01:12:38.669 --> 01:12:38.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
correct that that's not my experience
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert in Maine um M have a
 
01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
very different model for their medical
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
program um data shows that they have uh
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
coupls to 100,000 register Pati office
 
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:54.790 align:start position:0%
coupls to 100,000 register Pati office
of

01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:12:58.350 --> 01:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
Canabis policy does not require
 
01:13:00.629 --> 01:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
registration with the state of the
 
01:13:03.149 --> 01:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
patient but uh does require the
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
providers to issue those certifications
 
01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
report the member certifications they
 
01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:08.149 align:start position:0%
report the member certifications they
have

01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:13:08.159 --> 01:13:12.390 align:start position:0%
have
100,000

01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
in again I don't have sales data in
 
01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
front of me um I would I
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
impr model
 
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.790 align:start position:0%
impr model
model

01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
model
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
they are not required to test their
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
contaminants can choose to be AER and
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
marijuana whatever PTI they want to put
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
not but it is still still important to
 
01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
the patients of main even though they
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
may be getting
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
consum unfortunately their policy
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
marijana if you could suspend if you can
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
suspend for just a moment so at some
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
point we're going to go through HP 1598
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
as a amended from last term if you can
 
01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
provide some information to this
 
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
commission right now how the atcs can
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
integrate into this that's why we want
 
01:14:36.669 --> 01:14:36.679 align:start position:0%
to have a kind of a floor to work with
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not so you have something to look at
 
01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
you want to take a look at that maybe
 
01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
provide some suggestions on how that
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
would work
 
01:14:45.199 --> 01:14:47.310 align:start position:0%
would work
Mr

01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's real quick so again to wrap I want
 
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
to kind of close up the conversation a
 
01:14:54.669 --> 01:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
little bit and just say that the atcs
 
01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
are not my understanding of the summary
 
01:14:58.750 --> 01:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
of your question is
 
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
that the idea that you could have a
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
potential separate retail license that's
 
01:15:05.229 --> 01:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
integrated with an existing medical
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
you're not objecting to that you you
 
01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
think that's a reasonable model and then
 
01:15:11.790 --> 01:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
the followup with that is that on page
 
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
31 you do provide some incredible uh
 
01:15:18.669 --> 01:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
clear um public health issues that you
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
want to see integrated into the Bill
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you okay next question
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I have a child safety
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
issue relating to uh advertising
 
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
accountability and oversight of the
 
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
atc's um I I know the the leg the
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
original statute uh that established the
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
atc's prohibited advertising and
 
01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
Outreach which very smart and and we're
 
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
talking the same thing with with um the
 
01:15:51.149 --> 01:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
recreational model uh the question I
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.629 --> 01:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
we have an ATC that was established in
 
01:15:58.639 --> 01:16:00.430 align:start position:0%
we have an ATC that was established in
Plymouth

01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
Plymouth
 
01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
right n eight nine years ago and um they
 
01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.070 align:start position:0%
right n eight nine years ago and um they
were

01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
non-compliant with that uh Ru making so
 
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
they were actually advertising when I
 
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
look at page seven and I noticed that
 
01:16:18.629 --> 01:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
the the majority of your sales go to age
 
01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
uh 35 through 74 the patients yet they
 
01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
were adver in purple train wreck which
 
01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
is a Prov provocative uh name for a
 
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
medicine and most cancer patients would
 
01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
not be looking for purple train wre uh
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
yet that's very interesting to to kids
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
and they will also do an Outreach on the
 
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
college a complaint was filed it was
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
dismissed um so it was no surprise to
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
our community within two years the
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
Adolescent youth use of marijuana
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
increased by
 
01:16:59.310 --> 01:16:59.320 align:start position:0%
88% this is a major issue that the
 
01:17:02.110 --> 01:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
commission has been discussing uh to
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
protect our children so my question is
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
it comes as far as oversight uh I think
 
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
that it it's lacking clearly you know
 
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
with the atc's yet and I heard
 
01:17:18.189 --> 01:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner mikica state that if there
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
is a a
 
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with with any of these
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
issues they would lose their license so
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
I would like to know um in addition to
 
01:17:32.629 --> 01:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
um the oversight sole oversight of the
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Liquor Commission will we
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
be discussing an oversight Commission in
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
addition uh and I think that that's
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
something we should
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
consider as a
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
commission okay so that that's my
 
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
question I said you know basically will
 
01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
there be an oversight uh commission that
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
has teeth
 
01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
that's really going to protect our
 
01:17:59.310 --> 01:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
children when it comes to uh monitoring
 
01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:00.149 align:start position:0%
children when it comes to uh monitoring
the

01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
franchisees uh because I don't believe
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
we have proper monit monitoring of the
 
01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
atc's and we want to make sure that we
 
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
strengthen our uh protective uh
 
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
you thank you um so I think you had
 
01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier um of the 30 like
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
Universe of 30,000 total patients that
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
have been in the the program that you
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
all administer at least some of them
 
01:18:27.629 --> 01:18:27.639 align:start position:0%
have left because it didn't work or they
 
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford the product and I'm
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
wondering you had mentioned I think 30%
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
it's about a 30% reduction in people who
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
are in the program and states that move
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
from Le U marijuana uh medical marijuana
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
to legal recreational you had said
 
01:18:44.189 --> 01:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
earlier and I'm curious has anyone done
 
01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
like an actual like um academic
 
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
qualitative review of that 30% and
 
01:18:53.669 --> 01:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
whether or not that 30% are less
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the outcome um when they
 
01:18:58.709 --> 01:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
left the therapeutic program and went
 
01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
into like whatever however their
 
01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
purchasing now through the retail Market
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
I understand the
 
01:19:06.629 --> 01:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
question if I if I understand the
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
question I I I I do not know of an
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
academic study with regard to
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
why former registered patients leave the
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
program um I am aware of
 
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.910 align:start position:0%
program um I am aware of
a

01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
of an abstract of a um a study that
 
01:19:31.709 --> 01:19:31.719 align:start position:0%
shows those decreases um but I'm not
 
01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:35.480 align:start position:0%
aware of an analysis of the reason
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
why ju so I just want to clarify then so
 
01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
we're not sure then that 30% are less
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
satisfied so we just know that 30% left
 
01:19:44.830 --> 01:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
the program but they could be equally
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
satisfied or more satisfied with the the
 
01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
treatment the services they're getting
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
currently we can we can speculate we
 
01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:54.199 align:start position:0%
have some good ideas of why they would
 
01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
leave um uh cost M cost y it's a $50
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
application fee in some cases providers
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
are charging hundreds of dollars for the
 
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
privilege of you know a half hour you
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
know meeting for a certification um uh
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
there's a proliferation
 
01:20:18.430 --> 01:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
of relatively inexpensive cannabis right
 
01:20:20.669 --> 01:20:20.679 align:start position:0%
across our borders for anyone 21 and
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
over people don't want to be on our
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
state registry we have just in the
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
interest of time my understand just
 
01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong unless the the
 
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
person dies there's no survey or data
 
01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
collected why the person didn't renew
 
01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
their license that is correct
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you so it sounds like the
 
01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
the real concern that you guys have is
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
if we legalize it across the state
 
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of model then the atc's could
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
be in danger of potentially not being
 
01:20:52.830 --> 01:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
able to provide the products they they
 
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
currently provide
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
because they be in competition and some
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
of the businesses would leave some of
 
01:20:59.709 --> 01:20:59.719 align:start position:0%
the business would leave to these new
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
stores is that the Crux the concern that
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
okay so so one of the suggestions you
 
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
you brought up was maybe to have a dual
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
license or what was it called the
 
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
Vermont system whatever integated
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
license right so I guess my question is
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
you had said something about there maybe
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
being dual Windows within you know the
 
01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
ATC window and then the body else window
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
or something like that that was
 
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
something you just said recently right
 
01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:28.639 align:start position:0%
like that could be a potential model so
 
01:21:32.110 --> 01:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is if our goal and I
 
01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
think this this is a noble goal but if
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
our goal is to be able to continue to
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
provide these sort of therapeutic
 
01:21:38.830 --> 01:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
products that would not otherwise be
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
available in a in a retail for-profit
 
01:21:46.149 --> 01:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
model would that still suffice so if you
 
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
have a ATC under the same roof as a
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
franchise or however we end up doing it
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
01:21:55.629 --> 01:21:55.639 align:start position:0%
are those products going to still I mean
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
it seems to me like we're we're facing
 
01:21:59.189 --> 01:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
the same problem there's a reason that
 
01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
these atcs can't survive in their own
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
under the current regulatory framework
 
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
putting putting an ATC under the same
 
01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
roof of a franchise or other system does
 
01:22:11.629 --> 01:22:11.639 align:start position:0%
that solve that problem or does it still
 
01:22:13.390 --> 01:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
get out competed away or put out of
 
01:22:15.550 --> 01:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
business or whatever and and I know you
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
don't a step towards solving the problem
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
what's that it's a step towards solving
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
the problem is there evidence from
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
Vermont that it has it has solve the
 
01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
problem or do a bunch of adcs still
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
close down or is there another I'm
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
trying to figure if it works or not ver
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
Vermont has Vermont had three uh license
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
facilities uh we have um three license
 
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
facilities um all of the at all the atcs
 
01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
all the Compassionate Care Centers in in
 
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
in Vermont are still operational um in
 
01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
part because they're allowed to sell uh
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
Adult Ed cannabis and representative I
 
01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
don't believe we were provided any
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
actual materials or evidence that the
 
01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
atcs would actually become insolvent
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
they're afraid that they'll become
 
01:22:59.070 --> 01:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
insolvent but even the the reduction in
 
01:23:00.669 --> 01:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
uh licenses or whatever you want to
 
01:23:02.669 --> 01:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cards that's under the
 
01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
presumption that every person with a
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
cards using or spending the same amount
 
01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
of money so we haven't had any
 
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
information provided to us and and what
 
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
that amount would have to be to the
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
point but they argue that it would be
 
01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
cheaper I'd offer one more data point if
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
you will just one moment please the
 
01:23:19.629 --> 01:23:19.639 align:start position:0%
other side of it is too A lot of these
 
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic facilities would be in a
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
position where they could cultivate and
 
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps sell their distribute their
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
products to other retail stores so they
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
would have another Market that they're
 
01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
not even factoring into their solvency
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot more information we'll
 
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
hear we'll have a day where I'm sure the
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
atcs will provide us with a lot of
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
representative uh to follow off I guess
 
01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
on the last question and it sounds as
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
though that one of the difficulties for
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
the atcs then in a recreational model
 
01:23:53.709 --> 01:23:53.719 align:start position:0%
where an at and and a recreational
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
facility would have to compete is that
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
the ATC is actually providing
 
01:23:59.629 --> 01:23:59.639 align:start position:0%
insufficient incentive for a patient to
 
01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
continue to go to the ATC in light of
 
01:24:04.709 --> 01:24:04.719 align:start position:0%
the recreational facility is that
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
correct your question is the atcs are
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
providing insufficient motivation
 
01:24:11.709 --> 01:24:11.719 align:start position:0%
for M
 
01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
maintaining patronage at a ATC uh to
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
that it is providing insufficient
 
01:24:19.229 --> 01:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
incentives to the patient to continue to
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
go to the ATC versus the uh Recreational
 
01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:24.709 align:start position:0%
go to the ATC versus the uh Recreational
facility

01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
I think that is a concern I just want to
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
be clear that the department and I'm
 
01:24:30.149 --> 01:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
going to sound like a broken record our
 
01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
goal is to ensure that there's access to
 
01:24:35.149 --> 01:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
these products the atcs themselves can
 
01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
speak to their business model in a much
 
01:24:39.149 --> 01:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
more elegant way than we can we just
 
01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we have we have
 
01:24:43.629 --> 01:24:43.639 align:start position:0%
14,000 very sick people in the state who
 
01:24:45.149 --> 01:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
use these products and we want to make
 
01:24:47.109 --> 01:24:47.119 align:start position:0%
sure that it's available and we want to
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
work with this commission to do that
 
01:24:51.229 --> 01:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
sort of crosswalk to the legislation to
 
01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
ensure we're not putting up unnecessary
 
01:24:56.629 --> 01:24:56.639 align:start position:0%
barriers so in respect to HB 1598 as
 
01:24:59.629 --> 01:24:59.639 align:start position:0%
amended from last term yes how would the
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
what suggestions do you have that would
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
allow the atcs to integrate into that
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
legislation a dual regulatory structure
 
01:25:11.629 --> 01:25:11.639 align:start position:0%
I mean uh The Liquor Commission uh
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
proposed the general model where a
 
01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
franchise model where any any entity any
 
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
person including the atcs could apply
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
for a license and our our our position
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
is is that in order for an ATC to apply
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
like anyone else they are currently
 
01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
under a regulatory structure that you
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
know that needs to be changed or
 
01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
accommodated with those changes what
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
would you change I'm sorry and and so
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
and so what the the work that needs to
 
01:25:42.669 --> 01:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
be to be done is a crosswalk between uh
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
1598 and 126 and we can bring that back
 
01:25:47.189 --> 01:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
to you we're happy to do and bring that
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
back to
 
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
you we just did we are looking for your
 
01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:53.560 align:start position:0%
direction very specific that was not the
 
01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
specific direction we were given but if
 
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
with that's the direction we can bring
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
that back to
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
you yeah and I I I I just want to
 
01:26:03.189 --> 01:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
apologize because I know that you have
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
all this in your presentation I just
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
feel like we haven't let you get to them
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering if you want to go back
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
to number 30 where you were page 30
 
01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
where you you are answering all of our
 
01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:15.560 align:start position:0%
questions in a very organized way we'll
 
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
be happy to at the pleasure of the chair
 
01:26:19.390 --> 01:26:19.400 align:start position:0%
I've asked that question myself not in
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
the same context but did I've asked the
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
question multiple times please do
 
01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:27.229 align:start position:0%
question multiple times please do
so

01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:30.040 align:start position:0%

commission's presentation um not all of
 
01:28:03.629 --> 01:28:03.639 align:start position:0%
them were um areas of accommodation and

ATC p uh uh therapeutic cannabis
 
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
patients um these are the areas I cannot
 
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
tell you right now what where
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
specifically in 589 1589 these
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
Provisions belong but the the back half
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
of this presentation has has these
 
01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
examples of areas of uh regulatory
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
alignment and accommodation uh to
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
allow atcs to enter this market and
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
we're happy to do that crosswalk with
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
five with1 1589 and again with the final
 
01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
product um or final draft product that
 
01:28:59.430 --> 01:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
the commission comes up with and do you
 
01:29:01.390 --> 01:29:01.400 align:start position:0%
have any recommendation on
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
on if you have a product that's purely
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
just CBD without any THC in there would
 
01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
that fa you think that's your fall
 
01:29:09.239 --> 01:29:10.910 align:start position:0%
that fa you think that's your fall
outside

01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
outside
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
regulations I can tell you what we do
 
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
now um I CBD is CBD is available
 
01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
everywhere it is a ferally legal
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
substance it's available everywhere um
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
so to allow or not allow the a the the
 
01:29:31.229 --> 01:29:31.239 align:start position:0%
recreational markets to sell an
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise legal product would be a
 
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
policy Choice currently we don't the the
 
01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
current law does not allow the atcs to
 
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
sell hemp derived CBD they are
 
01:29:44.669 --> 01:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
prohibited from growing hemp and
 
01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
extracting CBD from it uh that's that's
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
a policy consideration in order for them
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
to uh in order for them to be able to
 
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
sell um additional ratio products that
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
have higher percentages of CBD if the
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
question is leaning towards what do we
 
01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
do about unregulated hemp derived THC
 
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
products then there's they're currently
 
01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
prohibited by legislation
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh passed last year um and I know
 
01:30:16.830 --> 01:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a model in some one of
 
01:30:18.750 --> 01:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
these bills that would allow the Liquor
 
01:30:22.109 --> 01:30:22.119 align:start position:0%
Commission to regulate hemp derived um
 
01:30:22.119 --> 01:30:23.750 align:start position:0%
Commission to regulate hemp derived um
products

01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
um which
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
is a solution to that is allowing the
 
01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
cultivators under an adult use model to
 
01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:33.750 align:start position:0%
cultivators under an adult use model to
cultivate

01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
cultivate
 
01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
hemp and extract various cannaboids from
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
it growing hemp is cheaper you know than
 
01:30:41.790 --> 01:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
growing cannabis the the idea is for
 
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
anyone selling CBD That Remains the Same
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be regulated by any
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
of this that's its own situation right
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
now there's a lot of stores selling that
 
01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
they don't they're not going to require
 
01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
license to sell that anyone
 
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturing purely CBD without the THC
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
we don't want we want that makes perfect
 
01:30:59.430 --> 01:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
sense to me all right thank
 
01:31:02.830 --> 01:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
you kale then Sean you next thank you Mr
 
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
chair so in in your suggestion here
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
you're looking for potency limits on
 
01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
certain Recreational Products I I think
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
we all agree we we want to see some
 
01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:11.800 align:start position:0%
potency limit limits on some of the
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
Recreational Products is there currently
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
potency limits on any of your
 
01:31:18.189 --> 01:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
therapeutic products no there are not
 
01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
and it's appropriate to not have those
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
limits because High potency products and
 
01:31:26.350 --> 01:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
high milligram per serving products are
 
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
essential for certain patients to
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
achieve appropriate symptom
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
relief so no there are no potency limits
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
or serving size limits on therapeutic
 
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
products Mr
 
01:31:40.990 --> 01:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
represent uh I I would add there yes
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
there are limits on the amount of
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis that can be obtained by
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
patients uh in a in a 10day period and
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
that is 2 ounces every 10
 
01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:52.350 align:start position:0%
that is 2 ounces every 10
days

01:31:52.350 --> 01:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
uh you you partially answered this
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
question but if I if an individual has a
 
01:31:59.310 --> 01:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
therapeutic card and walks into a say
 
01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
hybrid hypothetical hybrid facility that
 
01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
has both medical and
 
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
recreational what incentivizes that
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
person holding that card to go to the uh
 
01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
the medical versus recreational and what
 
01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
could we put into a statute that would
 
01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
encourage those individuals to continue
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
on with the medical program versus the
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
recreational the number one reason is
 
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
price Recreation uh therapeutic products
 
01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
are traditionally in other Mar markets
 
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
significantly less because they are not
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
taxed um so that that is that is the
 
01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
model that that uh operates in other
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
states the other incentives are I am not
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not buying I don't have product
 
01:32:46.109 --> 01:32:46.119 align:start position:0%
availability on the rec side to get the
 
01:32:50.910 --> 01:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
10 to1 CBD THC ratio products um and I'm
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
certainly not going to get get a
 
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
suppository over there on the rec side
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have to go into the uh onto
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
the the the the adult the uh the
 
01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.510 align:start position:0%
the the the the adult the uh the
therapeutic

01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
counter represent kale thank you Mr
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
chair this is directed at the board um
 
01:33:11.229 --> 01:33:11.239 align:start position:0%
if there was a dual combining of these I
 
01:33:13.629 --> 01:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
think we would we would need to um put
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
in a statute that in order to get the
 
01:33:17.629 --> 01:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
high potency things they would still
 
01:33:19.149 --> 01:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
have to have the
 
01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
card you know like if we do write that
 
01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
in so just to clarify like the potential
 
01:33:29.790 --> 01:33:29.800 align:start position:0%
is if you have the cannabis card you may
 
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
be allowed to purchase other products
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
that perhaps someone without the card
 
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to purchase and that
 
01:33:44.830 --> 01:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
technically cannot have two different
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
you know agencies doing rule making you
 
01:33:52.109 --> 01:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
got to pick one or the other 18 TCS want
 
01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
to you know come join the the franchise
 
01:33:57.870 --> 01:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
Model come on in but if they don't if
 
01:34:00.270 --> 01:34:00.280 align:start position:0%
there's a rationale which they have
 
01:34:04.109 --> 01:34:04.119 align:start position:0%
convinced me totally convinced me that
 
01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
they should stay just the way they are
 
01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
they have a plenty of perks here like
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
they don't have limits that's a good
 
01:34:13.109 --> 01:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
thing right for them they have they
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
aren't taxed they aren't you there's
 
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
plenty of reasons why the atc's can be
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
thriving and continue to do and take
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
care of those New Hampshire customers um
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
and I I think that Just the Two Worlds
 
01:34:27.629 --> 01:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
should never should come never come
 
01:34:29.229 --> 01:34:29.239 align:start position:0%
together and nothing's preventing
 
01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:31.719 align:start position:0%
someone who has an interest in
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
ATC from perhaps trying to acquire a
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
franchise as well correct and I think if
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
I understood that testimony from last
 
01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
last time we were here that person would
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
have a significant amount of experience
 
01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
in the industry so when it comes to the
 
01:34:46.669 --> 01:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
criteria you would consider for granting
 
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
the franchise well that's that's
 
01:34:52.189 --> 01:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
obviously a huge plus so they not not
 
01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
that they they have per se an advantage
 
01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:55.400 align:start position:0%
but this having experience in the
 
01:34:57.390 --> 01:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
industry will give them a you can't have
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
two desks two windows you can't have and
 
01:35:01.950 --> 01:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
this is this is regulated by Health and
 
01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
Human Services this is regulated by the
 
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
commission no that's that's it's insane
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
you can't do other states have
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
successfully adopted that model and
 
01:35:13.149 --> 01:35:13.159 align:start position:0%
allowed um you know the medical Market
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
to uh uh to to be maintained and to and
 
01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
to thrive I used to I did Ru making for
 
01:35:20.109 --> 01:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
the Department for you know almost 15
 
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
years and you know
 
01:35:24.030 --> 01:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
there there are plenty of examples where
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
there is dual regulatory Authority and
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
shared rulemaking responsibility
 
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
requirements um you know statutory
 
01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
language including you know there's a
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
prim uh shall consult with uh prior to
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh rulem you know simply sets up a
 
01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
requirement for um collaboration between
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
agencies statutorily that's something
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
that we you know is is is is not common
 
01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
but it's not unheard of um and can
 
01:35:52.270 --> 01:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
easily be um easily be implemented
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
you have an example for that uh we have
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
we have joint rul making Authority with
 
01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission um for something
 
01:36:02.830 --> 01:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
um we have uh uh we have it in food the
 
01:36:07.229 --> 01:36:07.239 align:start position:0%
milk board um milk sanitation board um
 
01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
there's there's there's
 
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
joint we I personally wouldn't recommend
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
joint rulemaking because I agree that
 
01:36:17.470 --> 01:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
that is a cumbersome process um but in
 
01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
consultation with built into the statute
 
01:36:22.990 --> 01:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
requires collaboration ation um at a
 
01:36:25.109 --> 01:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
higher level than simply the other
 
01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
agency being a a stakeholder that can
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
come to a public rul making hearing I
 
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
would I would encourage that kind of uh
 
01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:36.159 align:start position:0%
language I I I have no problems with two
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
departments like you said that if if the
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
if the lior commission comes up with
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
testing regulations that there's nothing
 
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
stopping Health and Human Services to
 
01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
have a hearings and change their
 
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
whatever their rule is to to mirror that
 
01:36:52.590 --> 01:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
one there's no nothing stopping them
 
01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
from mirroring each other if they if
 
01:36:56.430 --> 01:36:56.440 align:start position:0%
they say the other one's got a good idea
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
of how to do that that would certainly
 
01:37:00.990 --> 01:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
make the rules process faster and easier
 
01:37:03.629 --> 01:37:03.639 align:start position:0%
if they can have the two of them but I
 
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
agree full wholeheartedly and I think
 
01:37:06.750 --> 01:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I think Mike's
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
suggestion sometimes that in
 
01:37:10.669 --> 01:37:10.679 align:start position:0%
consultation just allows us in
 
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
perpetuity depending you know we don't
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
have to worry about the personalities of
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
who's in charge at that particular
 
01:37:17.709 --> 01:37:17.719 align:start position:0%
moment to make sure that it's baked in
 
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
that at least there'll be a
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
collaborative atmosphere when you make
 
01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you Mr chair you may
 
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
be surprised rep representative hunt but
 
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
I fully agree with you on that point I I
 
01:37:39.149 --> 01:37:39.159 align:start position:0%
think one single state system is
 
01:37:41.709 --> 01:37:41.719 align:start position:0%
probably the cleanest way to go I do
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
have a question and this is this would
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
be I think one distinction between the
 
01:37:49.390 --> 01:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
the franchise model and the ATC model
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
currently you're selling um products at
 
01:37:57.790 --> 01:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
99% THC which is shattered dabs and oils
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
so can you do you have any data on on
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
basically the um the amount in on an
 
01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
annual level that is going out at that
 
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
extremely high potency
 
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
level with your sales we don't we uh no
 
01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
I do not have data on the specific
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
amount of um Rel the the the sales
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
volume of certain products the atcs
 
01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
certainly do um and and we but we could
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
certainly uh get that information um uh
 
01:38:33.470 --> 01:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
for you the atcs would be happy to
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
provide it too okay okay followup it
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
seems to me that if this the franchise
 
01:38:40.990 --> 01:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
model I would hope we're not going to be
 
01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
selling products at that um intensity
 
01:38:47.350 --> 01:38:47.360 align:start position:0%
level um that if if you do continue
 
01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
forward that would be a little n niche
 
01:38:53.709 --> 01:38:53.719 align:start position:0%
market market for you um certainly to be
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
purveying the the supersized um
 
01:39:03.629 --> 01:39:03.639 align:start position:0%
product so there you go do Dr Younger
 
01:39:05.669 --> 01:39:05.679 align:start position:0%
yeah so and for the commission as as
 
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
well as you I I am just trying to figure
 
01:39:10.430 --> 01:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
out so is what would keep like Granite
 
01:39:13.229 --> 01:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
Le cannabis for example from applying
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
for a franchise if and I I definitely
 
01:39:17.149 --> 01:39:17.159 align:start position:0%
understand what representative hun is
 
01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
saying it's like there's there seems
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
like some conflict if they're like
 
01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
literally in the same space but if
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
Granite Leaf cannabis had applied and
 
01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
had a franchise in X you know X area and
 
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
across the street had a medical cannabis
 
01:39:32.109 --> 01:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
I mean is there some reason why that
 
01:39:32.119 --> 01:39:32.990 align:start position:0%
I mean is there some reason why that
couldn't

01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
happen no no I would invite I would
 
01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
invite you to ask that question to to
 
01:39:42.270 --> 01:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis and I think from our
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
consideration is you know what we would
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
do in that crosswalk is not create
 
01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
unnecessary barriers I I keep pointing
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
to the testing because that's probably
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
the most tangible that you would want to
 
01:39:55.109 --> 01:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
at least have similar standards so you
 
01:40:01.589 --> 01:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:04.189 --> 01:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
oranges so Trish I just want to make
 
01:40:06.589 --> 01:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
sure I'm clear on this so my concern was
 
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
the not for-profit status of a uh and
 
01:40:11.189 --> 01:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
how it enters into the retail market and
 
01:40:13.629 --> 01:40:13.639 align:start position:0%
where there might be conflict where in
 
01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
regular you have you may have regulation
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
in in the Cannabis Market that doesn't
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
allow that or in medical Market that
 
01:40:21.910 --> 01:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow that so that was my
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
concern is making sure again where they
 
01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
cross like I don't necessarily think
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
having ATC or dispensary having a retail
 
01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
license is a bad idea if they use that
 
01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
to supplement keeping Medical Market
 
01:40:34.510 --> 01:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
lower U the fact that the medical
 
01:40:36.270 --> 01:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
Market's not going to be charged a taxes
 
01:40:38.669 --> 01:40:38.679 align:start position:0%
the retail Market will um but there's a
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
possibility of allowing them to keep the
 
01:40:43.629 --> 01:40:43.639 align:start position:0%
more robust Medical Market alive um if
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
you will um but my my concern was your
 
01:40:47.950 --> 01:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory requirements on the medical
 
01:40:49.589 --> 01:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
market and whether or not you have
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
prohibitions that would be in Conflict
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
so we currently do we currently require
 
01:40:55.629 --> 01:40:55.639 align:start position:0%
the not for-profit status I think that's
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
a place where again when we have a solid
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
bill that we can look at we can point to
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
and say that's a place that you could
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
consider making changes in
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
126k um or X I'm sorry 126x um as a
 
01:41:10.109 --> 01:41:10.119 align:start position:0%
department I we
 
01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
are you know we are fairly agnostic on
 
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
the non-for-profit not for-profit we
 
01:41:16.830 --> 01:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that they align you
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
know at the end of the day I want to
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
make sure it's affordable I want to make
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
sure it's safe I want to make sure it's
 
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
accessible if we can advance those ideas
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:30.510 --> 01:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
in the other thing I would just add to
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
that as well I think historically I I
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
just want to acknowledge the historic
 
01:41:36.669 --> 01:41:36.679 align:start position:0%
piece of the not for-profit sense is
 
01:41:38.310 --> 01:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
that it is my understanding that at the
 
01:41:39.870 --> 01:41:39.880 align:start position:0%
time many years ago while we were doing
 
01:41:41.629 --> 01:41:41.639 align:start position:0%
this there was this notion around big
 
01:41:44.109 --> 01:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
cannabis coming in I don't know it there
 
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
is certainly some uh thoughts that have
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
changed in that um as of today but I
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
want to acknowledge that that was the
 
01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
concern many years ago as therapeutic
 
01:41:55.870 --> 01:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis came on board and why I believe
 
01:41:57.750 --> 01:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
it landed on the not for-profit status
 
01:41:59.350 --> 01:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
was that it was not going to be a
 
01:42:02.430 --> 01:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
commercialized big cannabis industry
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
whatever that means the current right
 
01:42:07.149 --> 01:42:07.159 align:start position:0%
right now there's only one other state
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's only one other state um that
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
requires um their medical programs to be
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
not for-profit every other state that
 
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
had a nonprofit requirement has removed
 
01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
it um uh identifying that as a barrier
 
01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
for the um the medical program to enter
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
the the retail Market um having two
 
01:42:23.950 --> 01:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
different business models under the same
 
01:42:26.189 --> 01:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
entity is a unnecessary barrier it was
 
01:42:27.950 --> 01:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
found Arizona is the only state that
 
01:42:30.990 --> 01:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
still requires nonprofit status um and
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
the other point is that it is not it is
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
not believed that nonprofit status
 
01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
reduces the price of product it is it is
 
01:42:41.229 --> 01:42:41.239 align:start position:0%
a certainty that the nonprofit status
 
01:42:43.589 --> 01:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
actually increases the price of product
 
01:42:47.310 --> 01:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
and I invite the you to ask the atc's uh
 
01:42:49.870 --> 01:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
that question on how the requirement for
 
01:42:53.070 --> 01:42:53.080 align:start position:0%
the atcs to be a nonprofit impacts their
 
01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
business model in terms of investment
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
debt payment Etc yeah obviously they can
 
01:43:00.030 --> 01:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
speak to that much more elegantly than
 
01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:00.790 align:start position:0%
speak to that much more elegantly than
we

01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
can yeah sorry I'd like to follow up on
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
Miss Nero's uh question line of
 
01:43:08.189 --> 01:43:08.199 align:start position:0%
questioning just for a moment really
 
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
quickly uh is it is it true that uh you
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh identified the fact that there is no
 
01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh THC percentage concentration of Delta
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
9 THC limit on any of the products sold
 
01:43:23.229 --> 01:43:23.239 align:start position:0%
in the atcs is that correct that is
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
correct okay and are you aware of the uh
 
01:43:29.149 --> 01:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
scientific studies that associate High
 
01:43:32.430 --> 01:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
concentration uh THC uh consumption with
 
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis use disorder uh yes we are we
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
have we work closely with our medical
 
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
board uh and and that's an issue that uh
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
they've explored and and taken up we're
 
01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
we're aware of the uh the the existence
 
01:43:47.790 --> 01:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
and the prevalence of cannabis use
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
disorder in certain segments of the
 
01:43:51.790 --> 01:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
population especially with with regard
 
01:43:54.669 --> 01:43:54.679 align:start position:0%
to heavy chronic use and once a card is
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
issued uh and if there's no limit on the
 
01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
concentration um how does that medical
 
01:44:02.830 --> 01:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
board or cons
 
01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
consults um monitor a patient uh who
 
01:44:10.109 --> 01:44:10.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to see a practitioner
 
01:44:12.910 --> 01:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
thereafter uh to identify whether or not
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
that individual who's been purchasing
 
01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
high concentration TC has developed
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis use
 
01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:22.639 align:start position:0%
disorder Dr Younger answer yeah so um
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know every every practice is
 
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
different but like for example at
 
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth we have our patients come and
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
at least every 3 to six months um with
 
01:44:32.109 --> 01:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
like set functional goals we were
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
testing during that time with some
 
01:44:35.629 --> 01:44:35.639 align:start position:0%
validated testing for cannabis use
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
disorder including like you had
 
01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned like how often in the last
 
01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
week have you felt high things like that
 
01:44:43.870 --> 01:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
so um I I think that they don't require
 
01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
that that happens but I think most uh
 
01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:49.159 align:start position:0%
good practitioners are do have some
 
01:44:50.589 --> 01:44:50.599 align:start position:0%
follow-up plan when they're certifying
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
someone for cannabis um and the patient
 
01:44:55.629 --> 01:44:55.639 align:start position:0%
at least in our institution are required
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
to come before they are recertified we
 
01:44:59.790 --> 01:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
have to complete that paperwork you know
 
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
once every one to three years the time
 
01:45:04.270 --> 01:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
and the person could then potentially go
 
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
to another provider because there's no
 
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
um well let me ask a foundational
 
01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
question then um for therapeutic
 
01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis it is not part of the um
 
01:45:18.629 --> 01:45:18.639 align:start position:0%
prescription monitoring program pdmp
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
correct so the is not but it would be
 
01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
great if it was well perhaps that should
 
01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
be a requirement but um so effectively
 
01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
then the patient could just go doctor
 
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
shop from practitioner to practitioner
 
01:45:34.830 --> 01:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
every time they need a new card correct
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
okay and and one last follow that was
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
that was a bill that passed well well
 
01:45:44.430 --> 01:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
pass in the house at beding 2019 2020
 
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
that pass in the house I believe in the
 
01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.790 align:start position:0%
that pass in the house I believe in the
2019

01:45:47.790 --> 01:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
2019
 
01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:49.470 align:start position:0%
2019
2020

01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
2020
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
pdmp we got we got to move to we have
 
01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
one more
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair I have uh
 
01:46:01.470 --> 01:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
a I have a question regarding the cost
 
01:46:03.189 --> 01:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
factor and the structure of the state
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
system as we're approaching it is to
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
keep costs as low as possible and so we
 
01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
have uh that's the direction we're
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
moving in so that we can undercut other
 
01:46:17.109 --> 01:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
undercut other states and are you
 
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
concerned that this is a um a patient
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
was uh I was speaking to just recently
 
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
said that they they couldn't afford uh
 
01:46:28.589 --> 01:46:28.599 align:start position:0%
the ATC pricing structure well hence the
 
01:46:30.990 --> 01:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
the need for a black market correct so I
 
01:46:33.510 --> 01:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
mean this is something that is of
 
01:46:36.510 --> 01:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
concern to you and and for us to
 
01:46:38.189 --> 01:46:38.199 align:start position:0%
understand this it is believed that if
 
01:46:40.589 --> 01:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
the atcs can enter the adult youth Mar
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
market and make um the majority of their
 
01:46:46.270 --> 01:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
uh their operating costs from uh retail
 
01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
use that uh therapeutic uh product
 
01:46:51.790 --> 01:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
prices will come down okay okay thank
 
01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
you but again that would be a better
 
01:46:55.310 --> 01:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
question for the
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
atc's I just have
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
a it's not curio so somebody has a
 
01:47:04.149 --> 01:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
medical to get from a doctor so they can
 
01:47:07.390 --> 01:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
the different dispensar can feasable
 
01:47:10.589 --> 01:47:10.599 align:start position:0%
somebody could go to one get that two o
 
01:47:12.189 --> 01:47:12.199 align:start position:0%
and then go to the other and get two
 
01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
ounces or is it some sort of
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
coordination where
 
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
they we we uh it's a good question we
 
01:47:21.070 --> 01:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
enforce those limits
 
01:47:23.709 --> 01:47:23.719 align:start position:0%
um while while it's while it's while
 
01:47:26.229 --> 01:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
it's feas while it's feasibly possible
 
01:47:28.589 --> 01:47:28.599 align:start position:0%
um uh the department has a process by
 
01:47:31.990 --> 01:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
which we monitor um uh sales across all
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
the atc's um and uh and uh send you know
 
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
we've started we've sent warning letters
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
don't do it again and that compliance
 
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
has uh has come down significantly um
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
since the uh the law allowed uh all the
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
patients to go to all the atcs so where
 
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
technically um they don't have yes right
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
right now they don't have a shared
 
01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%
system um uh data system for the
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
transaction history between the the
 
01:47:58.589 --> 01:47:58.599 align:start position:0%
multiple entities uh we have a um an
 
01:48:00.870 --> 01:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement side of our program that
 
01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
enforces that and we have the authority
 
01:48:04.669 --> 01:48:04.679 align:start position:0%
under statute to uh revoke cards based
 
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:13.189 --> 01:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
violation thank thank you for your time
 
01:48:15.550 --> 01:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
I see any more questions anyone have
 
01:48:17.189 --> 01:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
seeing No Hands raised I want to thank
 
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
both both the witnesses from bhhs for
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:43.589 --> 01:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
you so we're not gonna we're probably
 
01:48:46.270 --> 01:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
not going to make it through 1598 today
 
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
just I know everyone's uh
 
01:48:51.149 --> 01:48:51.159 align:start position:0%
shock was really anticipating that that
 
01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh enlightening process but anyway we
 
01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
have another draft too so that will be
 
01:48:57.189 --> 01:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
handed out to members of the commission
 
01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll go over that it's another
 
01:49:01.149 --> 01:49:01.159 align:start position:0%
draft that's kind of floating around so
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
we'll cover that but before I know some
 
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
people may have to be taken off we
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
should set the next meeting date now Mr
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
chair if I may I'd like to propose a
 
01:49:12.990 --> 01:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
couple dates to try to get an extension
 
01:49:14.910 --> 01:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
so people can plan their schedule and
 
01:49:17.310 --> 01:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
and some proposed topics for those dates
 
01:49:19.149 --> 01:49:19.159 align:start position:0%
you don't mind you're more than welcome
 
01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
but start with the dates all right so
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to stick with
 
01:49:24.589 --> 01:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
Thursdays and so
 
01:49:26.910 --> 01:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
10:19 and my recommendation for that
 
01:49:28.990 --> 01:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
meeting is we ask C AG to come in to
 
01:49:30.910 --> 01:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
answer questions we have about legality
 
01:49:33.550 --> 01:49:33.560 align:start position:0%
issues and and have that conversation
 
01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
and whatever time is left over from that
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
to allow for public comment do you think
 
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's just and I'll welcome anyone to
 
01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
comment on this should we go over the
 
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
draft that we have before so we can kind
 
01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
of gather the concerns we have with the
 
01:49:49.709 --> 01:49:49.719 align:start position:0%
policy and then maybe we vet vetted
 
01:49:49.719 --> 01:49:53.229 align:start position:0%
policy and then maybe we vet vetted
thereafter

01:49:53.229 --> 01:49:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:55.629 --> 01:49:55.639 align:start position:0%
U Mr chair I think that what was
 
01:49:58.589 --> 01:49:58.599 align:start position:0%
discussed in in the first meeting uh and
 
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to speak for
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
um uh Mr Mara Esquire that uh the
 
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
proposal was to hear from uh the various
 
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh department and commission and agency
 
01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:14.719 align:start position:0%
heads first perhaps some subject matter
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
experts and then uh with that armed with
 
01:50:19.629 --> 01:50:19.639 align:start position:0%
that information much like we have heard
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
from Liquor Commission DHHS who may
 
01:50:25.350 --> 01:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
actually be required to come back with
 
01:50:28.109 --> 01:50:28.119 align:start position:0%
some additional information we just that
 
01:50:31.950 --> 01:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
was that was the goal we have a draft
 
01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
and asked about how to implement it you
 
01:50:36.430 --> 01:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
know the ATC policies into that and how
 
01:50:38.310 --> 01:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
they would be integrated I understand
 
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
what the what the handout says but I'm
 
01:50:43.069 --> 01:50:43.079 align:start position:0%
talking about the actual legislation
 
01:50:44.470 --> 01:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to do that until we had
 
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
a product to present to them so
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we have a product present
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's the final product and people see
 
01:50:53.550 --> 01:50:53.560 align:start position:0%
a draft and
 
01:50:56.189 --> 01:50:56.199 align:start position:0%
they I keep thinking that people want to
 
01:50:57.790 --> 01:50:57.800 align:start position:0%
I think for the interest people that are
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
interested in this they need to see a
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
proposal and then they can pick apart
 
01:51:04.950 --> 01:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
the proposal well with all due respect I
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
don't I I think that's a bit of an
 
01:51:08.510 --> 01:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
exercise of putting the cart for the
 
01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
horse in that uh these uh department
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
heads Commissioners uh in subject matter
 
01:51:17.069 --> 01:51:17.079 align:start position:0%
exports would help us craft a better
 
01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
legislation then rather than looking at
 
01:51:20.830 --> 01:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
it first listening to them and then
 
01:51:22.870 --> 01:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
having to go back and do it again so Mr
 
01:51:24.510 --> 01:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
chair if I can go finish go through this
 
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
and then might answer some of these
 
01:51:28.030 --> 01:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
questions right again so I tend to agree
 
01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:29.480 align:start position:0%
with the chief I think having the AG in
 
01:51:31.390 --> 01:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
to answer some questions may help us
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
craft better legislation uh going
 
01:51:36.189 --> 01:51:36.199 align:start position:0%
forward and help Define that so again my
 
01:51:37.790 --> 01:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
my recommendation was to have the AG
 
01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
come in on the 19th um and answer
 
01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
questions have a conversation of his
 
01:51:45.709 --> 01:51:45.719 align:start position:0%
understanding of um commissioner Malik's
 
01:51:47.550 --> 01:51:47.560 align:start position:0%
uh proposal for a franchise
 
01:51:49.629 --> 01:51:49.639 align:start position:0%
understanding dhs's now they have a
 
01:51:51.069 --> 01:51:51.079 align:start position:0%
basis us to understand where we're kind
 
01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
of heading and he can comment on that
 
01:51:55.229 --> 01:51:55.239 align:start position:0%
help us craft legislation so on the 19th
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
we would have the AG in and then anytime
 
01:51:58.589 --> 01:51:58.599 align:start position:0%
that's left over allow for public
 
01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
comment does the 19th work
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
for raise your hand if it
 
01:52:07.950 --> 01:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
works ra your hand it
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
works is there a time on Dr uh young is
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:26.430 align:start position:0%
 
better

01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.350 --> 01:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
so 10 a.m. n or n either
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
one is there is there another date that
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
might work well we're GNA have a bunch
 
01:52:36.390 --> 01:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
of dates so I'm trying to get get
 
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
through and get all the dates down so we
 
01:52:41.109 --> 01:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
can yeah that's what I'm thinking I was
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to try and get through the whole
 
01:52:44.510 --> 01:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
list and then we can talk about so the
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
we'll have one hearing on the 19th we'll
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
we'll start it can we I'm I'm totally

01:53:42.750 --> 01:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
112 I I can't do the second what's that
 
01:53:46.069 --> 01:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
I'm not available on the second okay
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:53.790 align:start position:0%
 
propose

01:53:53.790 --> 01:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:55.069 --> 01:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
I was just trying to stick with Thursday
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
so every could plan accordingly but we
 
01:54:00.270 --> 01:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
need to jump around days that's fine we
 
01:54:03.149 --> 01:54:03.159 align:start position:0%
do something next week maybe instead of
 
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
I mean we don't have to do it every
 
01:54:07.589 --> 01:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
other week can we 19's next week that
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
next week no that's week after that's
 
01:54:10.350 --> 01:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
the week after why can we do something
 
01:54:12.750 --> 01:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
next week 12 yeah like the 12th instead
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
of the 19th for the 11th or the 10th or
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
the 9th or the 13th I I can't do the
 
01:54:20.669 --> 01:54:20.679 align:start position:0%
12th I can't either I other commit it's
 
01:54:22.830 --> 01:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
a short it's a short week what about
 
01:54:24.589 --> 01:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
like the 10th 11th 12th 13th like
 
01:54:27.669 --> 01:54:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:29.790 --> 01:54:29.800 align:start position:0%
there let let me run through let me run
 
01:54:31.069 --> 01:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
through all the dates I proposed and
 
01:54:32.830 --> 01:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
then we can start banging them around
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
because I think we have enough time
 
01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
everything we're doing I'm I'm worried
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
about the December 1st date and making
 
01:54:40.030 --> 01:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
sure we get to a solution by December
 
01:54:42.350 --> 01:54:42.360 align:start position:0%
1st how about October 23rd is that date
 
01:54:44.669 --> 01:54:44.679 align:start position:0%
raise your hand it's a Monday what do we
 
01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
start the week raise your hand if you're
 
01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
available on Monday the 23rd to replace
 
01:54:53.229 --> 01:54:53.239 align:start position:0%
the 19th we I think we're g do both yes
 
01:54:54.430 --> 01:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
I will not be
 
01:54:56.109 --> 01:54:56.119 align:start position:0%
AV not
 
01:54:58.030 --> 01:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
available the whole
 
01:55:00.910 --> 01:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
week right I'll be in
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
amdam say I'm gonna try anything while
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'm there I'm sure you wouldn't but
 
01:55:11.510 --> 01:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
streams what about the 26 19th and the
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
27 we're scheduled I think both the
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
house and uh Senate
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:26.109 --> 01:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
concession would the 24th be better than
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
the 23rd I think not for represent the
 
01:55:35.149 --> 01:55:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:39.229 --> 01:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
aning I'm being I'm away on the I fly
 
01:55:42.750 --> 01:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
away on the 22nd suay the 22nd and I fly
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
back November 1 so November 2nd I was
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
available am available
 
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
so why don't we do the n why just do the
 
01:55:56.109 --> 01:55:56.119 align:start position:0%
19th and 24th for now 19 and 24 okay so
 
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
on the 19th we'll have the AG and public
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
comment on the 24th we'll start with
 
01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
public comment and go into work session
 
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
what about
 
01:56:06.550 --> 01:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
atcs uh you want to bring atcs in I
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
sounds I think we should have them
 
01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
after after the B so on the 24th we'll
 
01:56:15.870 --> 01:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
plan the atcs and public
 
01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
comment I I think it it'd be very
 
01:56:22.229 --> 01:56:22.239 align:start position:0%
important before we get too far ahead uh
 
01:56:24.350 --> 01:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
meeting with a lot of people this I I
 
01:56:26.550 --> 01:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
spoke about this organization it's
 
01:56:28.109 --> 01:56:28.119 align:start position:0%
called getting it right from the St
 
01:56:29.709 --> 01:56:29.719 align:start position:0%
advancing public health and equity in
 
01:56:34.270 --> 01:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
canvas policy the woman is uh Dr Lyn
 
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
silver she's an MD mph faap senior
 
01:56:40.270 --> 01:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
adviser for the Public Health Institute
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
in in California and if you go to that
 
01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
website I encourage everybody here to go
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
to that website uh she's they this
 
01:56:51.669 --> 01:56:51.679 align:start position:0%
organization's evaluated what has worked
 
01:56:54.390 --> 01:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
what hasn't worked and
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
suggests uh and suggest what should be
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
in legislation she's willing to come
 
01:57:01.030 --> 01:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
here to speak from
 
01:57:03.069 --> 01:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
California so again my my thought was
 
01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
leaving it just a public comment allows
 
01:57:06.109 --> 01:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to sign up to testify
 
01:57:07.470 --> 01:57:07.480 align:start position:0%
you can sign up to testify and give
 
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
public comment so if atcs want to come
 
01:57:10.910 --> 01:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
in they can come in if the doctor wants
 
01:57:13.589 --> 01:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
to come in the doctor can come in um
 
01:57:14.830 --> 01:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
that was the idea of just leaving an
 
01:57:16.589 --> 01:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
open comment period is allow anybody who
 
01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
we may not be even thinking of rather
 
01:57:21.109 --> 01:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
than try to figure out who everybody is
 
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
I would strongly recommend that this
 
01:57:26.189 --> 01:57:26.199 align:start position:0%
woman not come in to to sign up as a
 
01:57:27.709 --> 01:57:27.719 align:start position:0%
public speaker but we should have her
 
01:57:30.030 --> 01:57:30.040 align:start position:0%
here to make a presentation I think it
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
would be very useful to us is there
 
01:57:34.030 --> 01:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
anyone here from the atc's please raise
 
01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:34.830 align:start position:0%
anyone here from the atc's please raise
your

01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
hand now is it the preference of the
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
atcs to have a
 
01:57:41.950 --> 01:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
presented template or model from the
 
01:57:44.270 --> 01:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
commission but then the atcs to comment
 
01:57:46.830 --> 01:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
on and say what works what doesn't work
 
01:57:50.270 --> 01:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
or is it just the preference to have us
 
01:57:51.910 --> 01:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
put something together after the fact
 
01:58:04.750 --> 01:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
okay 24th we G have the atcs in public
 
01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:16.199 align:start position:0%
comment 19th the 19th we add the AG I
 
01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:17.800 align:start position:0%
think we're going to do you want to add
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
THC so we'll get rid of the public
 
01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:26.550 --> 01:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
AG then on then the 24th is just public
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
comment I think what we're going to do I
 
01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
think we could do may I yes um I think
 
01:58:34.830 --> 01:58:34.840 align:start position:0%
if we do if we get three dates on the
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
books 1019 Ag and public comment 1024
 
01:58:41.950 --> 01:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
atc's and public comment and then
 
01:58:44.270 --> 01:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
November 2nd this getting it right group
 
01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:45.560 align:start position:0%
and maybe we could do a little public
 
01:58:46.709 --> 01:58:46.719 align:start position:0%
comment I mean and then I'm not
 
01:58:49.069 --> 01:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
available to okay so one more date to do
 
01:58:51.149 --> 01:58:51.159 align:start position:0%
that and that's three dates of
 
01:58:53.229 --> 01:58:53.239 align:start position:0%
presentations public comment and then we
 
01:58:55.950 --> 01:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
can really start get in the work session
 
01:58:58.910 --> 01:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
correct that was Mr chair so we just
 
01:59:00.669 --> 01:59:00.679 align:start position:0%
need that third date yeah well we had
 
01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
the second but what Mr chairman what
 
01:59:06.830 --> 01:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
second Mr chair I have a question it
 
01:59:11.870 --> 01:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
feels like um there's several other
 
01:59:14.270 --> 01:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
entities that on the state level that
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
have um you know uh skin in the game
 
01:59:20.069 --> 01:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
here the state treasurer the Chief Med
 
01:59:22.350 --> 01:59:22.360 align:start position:0%
medical officer Commissioner of safety
 
01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Public Health um we
 
01:59:26.310 --> 01:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
heard from public health not the
 
01:59:28.910 --> 01:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner but we did hear from them
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
regarding appointed um conversation on
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
atc's um so there's other stakeholders
 
01:59:37.790 --> 01:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
that we would like to hear hear from and
 
01:59:40.589 --> 01:59:40.599 align:start position:0%
um they will be traveling in in addition
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
to the getting it right um from the
 
01:59:48.510 --> 01:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
start that Mr Mara spoke to so can it
 
01:59:51.510 --> 01:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
can we potentially have a a date if if
 
01:59:53.669 --> 01:59:53.679 align:start position:0%
we leave the last two week uh two weeks
 
01:59:55.709 --> 01:59:55.719 align:start position:0%
of November for example for work
 
01:59:59.550 --> 01:59:59.560 align:start position:0%
sessions uh on 1598 is there any way we
 
02:00:02.030 --> 02:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
could Target another date uh so that I
 
02:00:04.069 --> 02:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
can speak to some of the medical
 
02:00:05.629 --> 02:00:05.639 align:start position:0%
community that would like to come in and
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
speak they have they have uh pretty busy
 
02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
schedule so it the more time we have
 
02:00:15.069 --> 02:00:15.079 align:start position:0%
advanced notice the better just just I
 
02:00:16.270 --> 02:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
don't have an issue with that but I'm
 
02:00:18.189 --> 02:00:18.199 align:start position:0%
just going to emphasize whatever this
 
02:00:19.790 --> 02:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
commission does around recommends or
 
02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't recommend it's still going to be
 
02:00:24.149 --> 02:00:24.159 align:start position:0%
public Hearing in the legislator both
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate so there's
 
02:00:28.229 --> 02:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
still a long way to go if if whatever
 
02:00:30.149 --> 02:00:30.159 align:start position:0%
this commission does or does not
 
02:00:32.990 --> 02:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
recommend that is not the the finished
 
02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
product that's still going to go to the
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
Committees in the house and in the
 
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
Senate so there's still a long way to go
 
02:00:39.870 --> 02:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
what we're what we're up against is and
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
I think what we're trying to do is come
 
02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
up with basically is it a
 
02:00:47.629 --> 02:00:47.639 align:start position:0%
feasible recommendation on a state
 
02:00:50.669 --> 02:00:50.679 align:start position:0%
controlled model for candidat report now
 
02:00:52.589 --> 02:00:52.599 align:start position:0%
obviously their their input would matter
 
02:00:54.910 --> 02:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
but we don't even have a draft yet for
 
02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
anyone to comment on I still think
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
having a draft is the way to go I
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
because otherwise everyone's kind of
 
02:01:02.069 --> 02:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
just throwing stuff at us but half that
 
02:01:04.270 --> 02:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
stuff might be into these the these
 
02:01:07.069 --> 02:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
hearings been going on since I was inol
 
02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
I I understand that however a study
 
02:01:13.149 --> 02:01:13.159 align:start position:0%
commission is our our purpose is to take
 
02:01:15.550 --> 02:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
testimony and that testimony would
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
inform our um decision making whether
 
02:01:22.189 --> 02:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
whether it's you know refining uh you
 
02:01:24.990 --> 02:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
know past legislation or or recommending
 
02:01:28.350 --> 02:01:28.360 align:start position:0%
new legislation so I I I know we agreed
 
02:01:31.069 --> 02:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
upon this on on on our first meeting
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
September 8th that we would give
 
02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
advanced notice and I would appreciate
 
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
that if at all possible why don't we why
 
02:01:40.069 --> 02:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
don't we cover that on we'll discuss
 
02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
we'll continue that conversation on the
 
02:01:43.390 --> 02:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
19th because I don't know I think we'll
 
02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
get more dates on the 19th so Mr chair
 
02:01:47.870 --> 02:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
if I go back the 11th on the week of 11
 
02:01:49.589 --> 02:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
112 you said you're not available the
 
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:56.750 --> 02:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
Wednesday 111 is on the table well I'm
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
asking the chair he can't do the second
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:06.830 --> 02:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:09.229 --> 02:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
anyone how about this we have two dates
 
02:02:11.470 --> 02:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
we'll worry about I think we
 
02:02:14.350 --> 02:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
should I think we have two two's fine
 
02:02:16.990 --> 02:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
that's my that's my it's a problem the
 
02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
decision I we here we might as well thir
 
02:02:22.589 --> 02:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
dat well we we have two but we're not
 
02:02:24.069 --> 02:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
going to get too far ahead I think we
 
02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
have the two I would especially if we're
 
02:02:28.189 --> 02:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
going to invite I'm sorry Mr chair
 
02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
especially if we're gonna invite someone
 
02:02:31.030 --> 02:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
from California we might want to get
 
02:02:33.510 --> 02:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
that third date on so they can do travel
 
02:02:36.030 --> 02:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
plans and when we're here I feel like we
 
02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
have some momentum to get that third
 
02:02:39.229 --> 02:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
date on we have a pretty tight timeline
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chair to get this report out and so
 
02:02:44.310 --> 02:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm feeling a little uh motivated to
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
get these things on the books as as
 
02:02:48.310 --> 02:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
particularly as the fall gets even
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
busier and bus
 
02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
year what would the topic for the third
 
02:02:55.950 --> 02:02:55.960 align:start position:0%
meeting even be so again we have Ag and
 
02:02:59.069 --> 02:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
public comment for 19 atcs we're going
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
to hear for the atcs and the AG in the
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
19th we got to give no they answer is
 
02:03:05.390 --> 02:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
yes that's what we're going to do
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
oh public comment uh we can allow for
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
public comment thereafter but we want to
 
02:03:12.069 --> 02:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
hear from both to get th get that
 
02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
information because I think for us to
 
02:03:15.950 --> 02:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
put a model together we got to hear from
 
02:03:18.189 --> 02:03:18.199 align:start position:0%
both that means that draft won't even
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
really get going until after the 24th
 
02:03:22.750 --> 02:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
the 24th would be I would propose public
 
02:03:25.069 --> 02:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
comment again anybody can sign up we can
 
02:03:27.189 --> 02:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
anybody can request an agency come in
 
02:03:28.750 --> 02:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
during a public comment period just like
 
02:03:31.629 --> 02:03:31.639 align:start position:0%
any public hearing um and we we can move
 
02:03:33.950 --> 02:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
into work session at that point in
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
reviewing 159 so 19th is AG and atc's
 
02:03:39.910 --> 02:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
and then 24th is only public comment
 
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
public comment and if there's time
 
02:03:43.310 --> 02:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
remaining work session okay and then go
 
02:03:45.390 --> 02:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
through 1598 or any proposal that we
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
might have we're going to scrap 1598
 
02:03:48.870 --> 02:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
there a different proposal that kind
 
02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
proposal and use a date the first week
 
02:03:55.629 --> 02:03:55.639 align:start position:0%
of November to invite uh getting it
 
02:03:58.270 --> 02:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
right I would Echo your concern that we
 
02:04:00.109 --> 02:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
are working somewhat in a vacuum right
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
now without actually having a proposal
 
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
on the table we've now had four hours of
 
02:04:08.030 --> 02:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
presentations from two agencies because
 
02:04:09.750 --> 02:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
we are operating in a vacuum which has
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
turned into a freewheeling discussion
 
02:04:13.069 --> 02:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
about the merits of
 
02:04:15.629 --> 02:04:15.639 align:start position:0%
marijuana our purpose is to propose
 
02:04:17.830 --> 02:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
legislation let's work the way that most
 
02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
of committees do put proposed
 
02:04:21.430 --> 02:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
legislation on the table allow for
 
02:04:24.069 --> 02:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
comments on that the comment could be
 
02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
this is terrible legislation you need to
 
02:04:28.069 --> 02:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
start over but that stops us from
 
02:04:29.589 --> 02:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
working the complete vacuum in which
 
02:04:31.350 --> 02:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
we're taking two hours per
 
02:04:34.430 --> 02:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
testimony I couldn't agree more well
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
said you said about 10 times better than
 
02:04:38.229 --> 02:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
I was trying to say and there is a draft
 
02:04:39.870 --> 02:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
that that's been put together here I'll
 
02:04:41.750 --> 02:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
circulate that but that's not going to
 
02:04:44.270 --> 02:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
be 1598 but I think for everyone to have
 
02:04:45.870 --> 02:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
will let everyone take a look at that so
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to want to read that
 
02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
obviously before um the 19th as well and
 
02:04:52.430 --> 02:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
then I'll make sure that a copy that's
 
02:04:55.109 --> 02:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
provided to the atc's um any members of
 
02:04:58.350 --> 02:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
the atc's please email myself um or
 
02:05:00.310 --> 02:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
anyone else in the committee requesting
 
02:05:02.069 --> 02:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
that information so we can provide it in
 
02:05:03.790 --> 02:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
advance so you have some time to review
 
02:05:05.189 --> 02:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
it it's not uh obviously it's a
 
02:05:05.199 --> 02:05:06.430 align:start position:0%
it it's not uh obviously it's a
multi-page

02:05:06.430 --> 02:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
multi-page
 
02:05:08.950 --> 02:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
document and and who who who made that
 
02:05:10.830 --> 02:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
draft because I haven't seen any draft
 
02:05:13.310 --> 02:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
and I know that there are members that
 
02:05:15.990 --> 02:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
have wanted to suggest I just would like
 
02:05:17.470 --> 02:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
a little more structure to whatever
 
02:05:19.709 --> 02:05:19.719 align:start position:0%
draft is going to be circula
 
02:05:22.430 --> 02:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
for example I know that you know the
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
public health folks are getting together
 
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
to work on suggestion so before that
 
02:05:28.510 --> 02:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
draft goes up for example I would like
 
02:05:30.870 --> 02:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
this information to be included in that
 
02:05:33.149 --> 02:05:33.159 align:start position:0%
draft yeah I haven't I haven't read this
 
02:05:34.549 --> 02:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
to see if it's so that's why I'm saying
 
02:05:36.109 --> 02:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
I want to wait before a draft goes out
 
02:05:39.229 --> 02:05:39.239 align:start position:0%
before to have enough in there yeah and
 
02:05:41.149 --> 02:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
again this is the the first draft I'm
 
02:05:42.830 --> 02:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
sure there'll be a lot of edits to it so
 
02:05:44.950 --> 02:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
if that's not in there it most certainly
 
02:05:48.189 --> 02:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
welcome in there I accept to I I want to
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh kudos to new futures for doing what
 
02:05:54.229 --> 02:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
we at ask which is be specific about
 
02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
what language you would like to see in
 
02:05:59.109 --> 02:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
it so I urge people to have opinions
 
02:06:01.109 --> 02:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
about what they think should be in the
 
02:06:03.149 --> 02:06:03.159 align:start position:0%
bill to do what new Futures do and that
 
02:06:05.069 --> 02:06:05.079 align:start position:0%
applies for virtually any type of
 
02:06:07.990 --> 02:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
hearing Bill legislation not just
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.589 --> 02:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.599 --> 02:06:19.510 align:start position:0%
 
on

02:06:19.510 --> 02:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:06:22.510 --> 02:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
choose that third dat the first week of
 
02:06:25.310 --> 02:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
November Mr chair I just want to clarify
 
02:06:28.270 --> 02:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
that that um October 24th is going to be
 
02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
exclusive public comment open open
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
comment correct is that am I
 
02:06:35.310 --> 02:06:35.320 align:start position:0%
understanding that correctly if we bring
 
02:06:37.870 --> 02:06:37.880 align:start position:0%
the atcs in
 
02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
on 19 24th the idea was public comment
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
meaning anybody can sign up the testify
 
02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
and provide information and and then if
 
02:06:46.750 --> 02:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
there's any time left over we can move
 
02:06:48.629 --> 02:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
into some sort of work session great
 
02:06:48.639 --> 02:06:52.910 align:start position:0%
into some sort of work session great
thank

02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:56.669 --> 02:06:56.679 align:start position:0%
you would the 20 would the 24th be a
 
02:06:58.109 --> 02:06:58.119 align:start position:0%
great good for the person from
 
02:06:59.350 --> 02:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
California coming
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
in I think we can that's that's enough
 
02:07:03.790 --> 02:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
I've noticed to bring
 
02:07:07.270 --> 02:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
in across country sure would the 24th
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:22.750 align:start position:0%
 
California

02:07:22.750 --> 02:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:25.470 --> 02:07:25.480 align:start position:0%
I think I think our deadline would be
 
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:33.629 --> 02:07:33.639 align:start position:0%
late Mr share is there are we not
 
02:07:35.910 --> 02:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to use people or to use zoom or
 
02:07:37.629 --> 02:07:37.639 align:start position:0%
whatever to get people to talk to us
 
02:07:39.950 --> 02:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
like it seems there's there are a lot of
 
02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
experts in this country the idea of
 
02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
having to fly people in is our only way
 
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
to talk to them seems maybe not
 
02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
realistic in this exact scenario what
 
02:07:48.790 --> 02:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
you're saying makes sense the as you
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
open the door you have doctors from
 
02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
every state call in which what they'll
 
02:07:53.390 --> 02:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
be allowed to do once once you open the
 
02:07:56.069 --> 02:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
floor like that so I I don't believe
 
02:07:57.950 --> 02:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
someone would be able to participate
 
02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
provide testimony remote they could
 
02:08:03.549 --> 02:08:03.559 align:start position:0%
provide a PowerPoint or uh written
 
02:08:06.870 --> 02:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
testimony I mean they can even send us a
 
02:08:08.270 --> 02:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
you know they can make their YouTube
 
02:08:09.310 --> 02:08:09.320 align:start position:0%
video and send it to the committee I
 
02:08:13.709 --> 02:08:13.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
information but if the just let us know
 
02:08:19.589 --> 02:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
if that works um we have so we can set
 
02:08:21.709 --> 02:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
the agenda in
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
advance Mr chair throw some dates out so
 
02:08:25.790 --> 02:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
we have without topics we have at least
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
have dates that
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
we I I would like I would like to say
 
02:08:34.030 --> 02:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
that we've started a trend Thursday
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
mornings let's just say commit that
 
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to do Thursday mornings from
 
02:08:39.629 --> 02:08:39.639 align:start position:0%
now on now we know not everyone's going
 
02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to do it but at least this
 
02:08:43.790 --> 02:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
means that everybody knows that that
 
02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
November they know that it's Thursday
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
morning so the next Thursday I'm able to
 
02:08:55.549 --> 02:08:55.559 align:start position:0%
do is is the 9th the nth the 16 so 28th
 
02:08:58.549 --> 02:08:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:01.149 --> 02:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
meeting I can be here the second if you
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:08.669 --> 02:09:08.679 align:start position:0%
something or your
 
02:09:11.229 --> 02:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
clerk up but I'm just saying it's it's
 
02:09:13.629 --> 02:09:13.639 align:start position:0%
that we've traded a when schedule mine I
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
seeway I know I I appreciate that we'll
 
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
put the ninth as the as the other as
 
02:09:21.229 --> 02:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
next dat after that we could do we could
 
02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:23.599 align:start position:0%
do Friday the 3D I understand we have
 
02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
the Precedence of Thursdays but nothing
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
stopping us from using any other day uh
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
we could do that Friday the 3D and then
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
from then on out be be Thursday mornings
 
02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
and that way everybody knows now that
 
02:09:35.669 --> 02:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
for the rest of the month we're gonna
 
02:09:37.790 --> 02:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to reserve Friday the 3D and
 
02:09:39.669 --> 02:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
November 9th if we want just please
 
02:09:41.709 --> 02:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
check the calendar one of those may get
 
02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
cancelled and then we have the
 
02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
16th and then I moved it back because of
 
02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
we skip a week because of than
 
02:09:50.709 --> 02:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving and we go to the 29th which
 
02:09:51.990 --> 02:09:52.000 align:start position:0%

final product ready written and voted on
 
02:09:56.910 --> 02:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
on the 28th rather I'm sorry Tuesday
 
02:09:58.270 --> 02:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
that gives us a couple days in case we
 
02:09:59.430 --> 02:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
have to hurry up and schedule something
 
02:10:01.750 --> 02:10:01.760 align:start position:0%

02:10:19.790 --> 02:10:19.800 align:start position:0%

them very helpful M Mr chair quick
 
02:10:46.350 --> 02:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
question if we have to get a substitute
 
02:10:47.950 --> 02:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
for ourselves because we're at another
 
02:10:50.270 --> 02:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
meeting is that is that something we
 
02:10:53.229 --> 02:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
do I don't believe you need a substitute
 
02:10:55.629 --> 02:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
uh if someone's running late just keep a
 
02:10:57.549 --> 02:10:57.559 align:start position:0%
surprise you know as you can tell he G
 
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%

02:11:02.470 --> 02:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
while yeah
 
02:11:05.669 --> 02:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
know the 28th would be a voting day and
 
02:11:07.189 --> 02:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
you would have to be present to vote on
 
02:11:09.870 --> 02:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
