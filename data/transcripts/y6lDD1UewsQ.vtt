00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 align:start position:0%
chairman yes representative tarki thanks
 
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 align:start position:0%
quick question I know um representative
 
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
Stringham had replied to an email Thread
 
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
about scheduling yes about afternoon so
 
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
for example that 9: a I believe it was
 
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
the March 5th 9:00 a.m. that was
 
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
scheduled um it didn't say an end time
 
00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
or if we were going to move into the
 
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon do you know on those morning
 
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 align:start position:0%
starts should we assume we will be
 
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
working after lunch also for scheduling
 
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
purposes yes excellent question and I'm
 
00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
in the same situation as you I don't
 
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
know the exact time frame I would plan
 
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
for after lunch but I don't I think it
 
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
will be an all day session but perhaps
 
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
um Mr White could give some clarity to
 
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
that as we go along with regard to the
 
00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
Medicaid part
 
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
two section if you have anything to
 
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 align:start position:0%
contribute to timing on that sure um C
 
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
currently we had scheduled uh tely As I
 
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
understood it scheduled that until
 
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
approximately 12:00 p.m. um for that
 
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
presentation and one point of clarity
 
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
the um March 12th I I currently have the
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 1 p.m. in my calendar is
 
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.270 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 1 p.m. in my calendar is
that

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
assistant um so I think we sorry if I
 
00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
could interrupt absolutely we ended up
 
00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 align:start position:0%
needing to schedule that for 10: a.m.
 
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 align:start position:0%
because there may be a full committee
 
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
public hearing that afternoon but that
 
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
has not yet been
 
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
scheduled that was my understanding as
 
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
well in the notice I received um it was
 
00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
Wednesday the 12th at 10:
 
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 align:start position:0%
a.m and that is the prescription drug
 
00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
affordability board that's the notice we
 
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
all received so uh we'll try to work on
 
00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 align:start position:0%
timing yes representative nil vanco on
 
00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
the weather what how early do they post
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
that do you you know because some of us
 
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
leave early to get here right you have
 
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
any idea when they you know how early
 
00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759 align:start position:0%
they post that uh I would think we'll
 
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
shoot for uh 8 AM you would get an email
 
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
by that time yeah frame okay thank
 
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
okay our presentation today as was duly
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
noted and published in our calendar and
 
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
outside of the room for today Wednesday
 
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
February 26th at 1M is a budget work
 
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
session on the division for children
 
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
youth and families we've all been given
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh the handout which should be online or
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
will be shortly I notice you know
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
speaking of timing representative tersi
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
that this presentation is a 33 page long
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh sort of as a scale the one on Friday
 
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560 align:start position:0%
was 70 pages long and that took us about
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
4 and 1 half hours to get through uh so
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
my thought is this may be an indication
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
as for timing but uh we will see it's my
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
intention today to let everybody speak
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
who wishes to speak and any members of
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
the public who wishes to speak after the
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
formal in presentation is certainly
 
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
welcome to do so so I would just ask
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
that our presenters make very clear who
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
they are and where in the budget what
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
page and account unit we're working from
 
00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 align:start position:0%
that would be very helpful before we
 
00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:34.759 align:start position:0%
begin any comments at all from members
 
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 align:start position:0%

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%

briefing book are those in excess of a
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
million doll State fiscal year so there
 
00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
will be some accounting units that fall
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
under that threshold that you won't
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily see within the budget
 
00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:38.519 align:start position:0%
briefing book and with that said I will
 
00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
turn the presentation over to Marie

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
some of our key accomplishments and
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
highlights you'll see in the top
 
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
rectangle regarding dcyf
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
Workforce uh vacancies and assessment
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
case workers and those are our case
 
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
workers that uh complete investigations
 
00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:13.959 align:start position:0%
of abuse and neglect uh we've seen a
 
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
decrease from 9% to 4% when we compare
 
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
December of 2023 to December of 2024 so
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
year similarly vacancies in our Juvenile
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
Justice officers has decreased from 4%
 
00:11:32.829 --> 00:11:32.839 align:start position:0%
to zero when we compare December of 2023
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
to December of
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
2024 vacancies in our youth counselor
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
positions which are the positions that

Services Center have decreased from
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
56% in December of

2022 to 21% in December of
 
00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:55.959 align:start position:0%
2023 and to 133% in December of 2024 so
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
we've seen significant decreases in the
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate of of our youth counselors
 
00:12:03.629 --> 00:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
Miss Nunan would you um Mind questions
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
in between your presentation be happy to
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
okay representative tarki for question
 
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very quickly I'm just I'm
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
pleased to see that the vacancy rate has
 
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
dropped significantly can you give us
 
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
your um view on what was the most
 
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
important factor
 
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
there um fortunately there has been um
 
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
some raises built in from the
 
00:12:23.949 --> 00:12:23.959 align:start position:0%
legislature which has been um supportive
 
00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
um of our of our staff and our client
 
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
facing positions um so that's been a
 
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
positive movement um additionally we
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
made some changes to the way that our
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
child protection positions and our youth
 
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
counselor positions are posted working
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
with the state to post them in what we
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
call a mass recruitment fashion so it
 
00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:44.839 align:start position:0%
eliminates the need for a potential
 
00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
applicant to apply for uh various
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
position numbers for the same position
 
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
and allows um a ghost position number a
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
phantom number to be posted uh online
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
and for hiring managers to be able to
 
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
peruse the array of available position
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
numbers and higher into what's available
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
rather than asking applicants to
 
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
repeatedly apply uh by position number
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
which was a strain for applicants so
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
those are a couple of areas additionally
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
at at
 
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
syc um we have uh fine-tuned our
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
programming uh we're putting forth a
 
00:13:23.949 --> 00:13:23.959 align:start position:0%
trauma informed model uh we have um some
 
00:13:25.949 --> 00:13:25.959 align:start position:0%
new Administration we have a a fairly
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
new director um a new deputy director
 
00:13:31.189 --> 00:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
position um some positions really
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
aligned toward making sure that we've
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
got programming there clinical supports
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
in place we've got additional clinical
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
staff so the programming and stability
 
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
at syc has really allowed uh for the
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
youth counselor position to be more
 
00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
stable uh and to minimize um uh or
 
00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:50.839 align:start position:0%
maximize retention you're
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
welcome and and in in addition to that
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
just just providing um more of a
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
budgetary perspective on that um for the
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
bium in June 30th
 
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
2023 um we did have a Personnel back of
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
the budget cut uh in excess of $22
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
million and prior to that um we also the
 
00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
state was under a hiring freeze during
 
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
the initial phases of the pandemic um in
 
00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:18.519 align:start position:0%
the current bium the back of the budget
 
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
cut was more Broad in the sense that we
 
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
could satisfy that reduction through um
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
through any other class line uh that
 
00:14:29.749 --> 00:14:29.759 align:start position:0%
didn't have a restriction on it um so
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
that that globally as a department that
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
opened up our ability um to hire for
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
those positions because we weren't uh in
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
in in addition to the many strategies
 
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
that Marie described we weren't unfund
 
00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:43.759 align:start position:0%
specific positions and had no
 
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
them representative Neno for a question
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
yeah very very quick question these are
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
all full-time positions that that we're
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
talking about here that's correct and uh
 
00:14:59.749 --> 00:14:59.759 align:start position:0%
any part-time position positions or
 
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
anything that's contracted out we do
 
00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
have some part-time positions um at syc
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
for the youth counselor position um
 
00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:11.079 align:start position:0%
those are harder to um recruit for we've
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
had some interest and wanted to have
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
them available so that we had the the
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
the best array of uh of candidates and
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
positions and options available but it
 
00:15:20.749 --> 00:15:20.759 align:start position:0%
is a bit harder to recruit for the
 
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
part-time positions okay thank you
 
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.030 align:start position:0%
part-time positions okay thank you
you're

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
welcome moving down to the second a
 
00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
rectangle serving Children and Families
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
earlier so this is really a Hallmark of
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
the work that dcyf is is is working
 
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
toward is moving toward as I talk about
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
our agency priorities over the next two
 
00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
years we're really shining a light on
 
00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
serving families at their earliest time
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
of need and a couple of highlights in
 
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
this area to date uh in the first bullet
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
is our community Navigator program at
 
00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:54.279 align:start position:0%
our Central intake which is our hotline
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
so if a reporter um someone with a
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
concern for a child calls our Central
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
intake there's a community Navigator
 
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
available so that if the call of concern
 
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
will not result in an open investigation
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
with DCF there is somebody that can
 
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
reach out to the family or to the
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
reporter to provide resources so this is
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
an early effort to connect families that
 
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
may have needs uh but for which any
 
00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:24.519 align:start position:0%
concern for abuse neglect has not come
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
to that full that full level they can
 
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
still receive some resources information
 
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:31.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to meet their family needs
 
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
before needing to come to DC's attention
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
so we've seen some increase in referrals
 
00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:40.759 align:start position:0%
um and we've had 807 referrals um since
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
August of 2023 so that's a significant
 
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
amount of families receiving um a touch
 
00:16:48.749 --> 00:16:48.759 align:start position:0%
Point uh outside of the DCF
 
00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
system in the second bullet community-
 
00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
based voluntary services this is also a
 
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
service uh with case management that
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
happens outside of DCF um
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
with community-based voluntary Services
 
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
these families have had an investigation
 
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
for child abuse or neglect at the
 
00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
conclusion or throughout the
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
investigation we conduct a risk
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
assessment and for families that come in
 
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
at moderate high or very high need we
 
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
can offer them a community- based
 
00:17:20.029 --> 00:17:20.039 align:start position:0%
voluntary service where we have a couple
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
of community providers who um depending
 
00:17:24.189 --> 00:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
on the area of the state the family is
 
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
from will will um provide case
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
management can provide for services can
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
ensure that they are going out meeting
 
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
with families again trying to eliminate
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
the potential of another call to dcyf
 
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
Central intake when there's been no
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
determined the third bullet down is our
 
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
transformation um through our Juvenile
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
Justice transformation uh We've
 
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
developed an assessment process where
 
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement prior to filing a
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
delinquency petition regarding a youth
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
will first call our Central intake our
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
hotline and request uh Juvenile Justice
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
assessment and we have some juvenile
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
probation and parole officers whose
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility it is to meet with youth
 
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
and families assess whether the youth's
 
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
needs can be met in the community um and
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
thus diverting them from the juvenile
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
justice system from coming into this
 
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
deep end of the system through diversion
 
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
programs other Community Resources so
 
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
our Juvenile Justice transformation
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
effort has been very successful um we're
 
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
we've seen a 30% reduction in juvenile
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
probations from calendar year 2019 to
 
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
2023 moving to the third rectangle
 
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels for a question
 
00:18:44.669 --> 00:18:44.679 align:start position:0%
sure thank you if you go on
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
um on on the uh
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
intake if someone was
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
suspected that there may be child abuse
 
00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
or that that there might be in the
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
future is that something that they would
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
call intake on and let me give you a
 
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
specific thing sure my school board
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
recently passed a policy that says that
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
a teacher could withhold information
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
from a parent if they suspected that
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
sharing that information with the parent
 
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.510 align:start position:0%
sharing that information with the parent
might

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
cause abuse of the child is that
 
00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
something that would be handled and how
 
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
how does the department handle that or
 
00:19:26.149 --> 00:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
do don't they get involved in it if
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
anyone in in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
everyone is a mandated reporter and
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
every citizen so if anyone suspects that
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
their a child is being abused neglected
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
they're mandated to call dcyf Central
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
intake our hotline will process those
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
reports um if there's a belief that by
 
00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
informing um a parent or caregiver that
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
the child could be in danger that could
 
00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
be a reason not to first talk with the
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
parents but in the majority of cases we
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
are hopeful that um educators are
 
00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
working with families talking with
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
parents about observations they're
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
making uh regarding their children
 
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
because there could be opportunities to
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
help support families before abuse
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
neglect happens so we certainly
 
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
encourage that collaboration between
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
Educators and the children that they
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
serve do th do those get reported to the
 
00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh to the department if if it's
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
suspected for you know if if Mrs Smith a
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
teacher thinks that uh she doesn't want
 
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
to share information because she
 
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
suspects that it might happen is that
 
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
something that would be reported to the
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
department yes if they if they are
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
concerned that there's abuse neglect
 
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
happening could be happening any Su any
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
suspicion whatsoever they should be
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
calling Central and okay because and I'm
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
just trying to separate that sure uh
 
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
from the second part that that it has
 
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
happened versus I think it might sure um
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
it would it would be it would be
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
challenging for a teacher to be able to
 
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
assert whether or not abuse or neglect
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
has happened in every instance so any
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
suspicion should be called in so that
 
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
DCF can assess that and make that
 
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
determination yeah I'm I'm more
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about the I think it might
 
00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
happen not that it has
 
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
happened okay thank you yeah you're
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
welcome representative priest for a
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chairman um
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
back to your Juvenile Justice
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
transformation and assessment do you
 
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
have any numbers for um calendar year
 
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
17 on slide 17 um there's uh Juvenile
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
Justice data um the pink line in
 
00:21:48.269 --> 00:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
particular shows the Juvenile Justice
 
00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:50.919 align:start position:0%
assessment the count of Youth um is is
 
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
on the left axis so the count of Youth
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
serve through the juvenile uh justice
 
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
assessment um is included on this on
 
00:21:59.950 --> 00:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
this uh depiction
 
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
so are we continuing to see a reduction
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
so what we're seeing on this slide on on
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
again on slide 17 um the Gold Line the
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
yellowish line is the count of Youth
 
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
served in home in Juvenile Justice right
 
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
the blue line is residential so what
 
00:22:19.269 --> 00:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
what I'm seeing here what we're seeing
 
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
at dcyf is a reduction steady slow but
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
steady reduction in our inhome Juvenile
 
00:22:27.269 --> 00:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
Justice cases while the residential
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
treatment has declined a bit it's
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
staying fairly fairly steady so what
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
this says to me is that those youth that
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
can be diverted through the and have a
 
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
JJ assessment are most likely the youth
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
that could have been served in home but
 
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
were able to decrease even the inhome
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
served families and that certainly saves
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
time for court law enforcement Personnel
 
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice System overall so we
 
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
are seeing an impact in the data great
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.789 --> 00:23:03.799 align:start position:0%
uh moving to the third rectangle on uh
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
Slide Five kinship
 
00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
care um kinship care is something we're
 
00:23:10.269 --> 00:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
really proud of I do have a data slide
 
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
um in in the subsequent Pages as well
 
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
but what we're seeing currently is that
 
00:23:18.269 --> 00:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
the initial outof home placement with is
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
with kin is happening 74% of the time
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
and that's up 45% um in this state
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so what this means is that
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
when a child um needs to come into out
 
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
of home care because it's no longer safe
 
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
in their in their family of origin we
 
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
first want to place in kinship care
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
which means it's someone known to the
 
00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:42.039 align:start position:0%
child it's a relative it's a coach it's
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
someone that has a relationship with a
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
child you may be familiar the
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
legislature supported us in passing new
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
kinship law so that's been very
 
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
successful for us and for families um so
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
we're seeing kinship care currently
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
surpassing kids in out of home foster
 
00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
care uh which is which is which is a win
 
00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:01.559 align:start position:0%
a win for kids a win for families um so
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
that's a a really important um
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
accomplishment the second bullet in
 
00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
kinship is that children served in
 
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
kinship care um again surpass those
 
00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:11.799 align:start position:0%
served in foster care and what we're
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
seeing in the early data is that
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
children placed in kinship care seem to
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
be more likely to reunify with their
 
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
birth families so that's important
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's that relationship between the
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
kinship in the in the home of origin
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
that the parents um working
 
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
collaboratively and reunification is
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
looking like it happens more frequently
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
uh more often when children are first in
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
kinship care representative walner for a
 
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.110 align:start position:0%
kinship care representative walner for a
question

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
you what kind of resources are Kip um
 
00:24:44.909 --> 00:24:44.919 align:start position:0%
placements provided I mean do they
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
receive a foster placement um payment
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
just like a foster family would what
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
kinds of things do we do for them yep
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
yep so we are processing um a rule and
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
an ability to
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
um be able to pay Foster um kinship
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
families the same stien as a foster care
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
parent uh once they're licensed so that
 
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
that's equal uh we also can provide the
 
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
same kinds of services so if the child
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
and family could benefit from an inhome
 
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
service to support any challenging
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
symptoms that the child is exhibiting
 
00:25:23.789 --> 00:25:23.799 align:start position:0%
any needs that the caregivers have to
 
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
provide for the for the child in their
 
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
home those same array of inhome services
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
are available as as they are for foster
 
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
families can I have a
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
followup I think I heard you say that um
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
when they are eligible to be licensed so
 
00:25:42.029 --> 00:25:42.039 align:start position:0%
the kinship um family goes through
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
licensing just like a foster family yes
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
there's some slight differences in the
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
licensing but there's a a license um and
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
that was legislatively put through um
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
recently and so it does allow those
 
00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
families to have a license it's a it's a
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
bit of a different license than the
 
00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
Foster families um but then allows for
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
that stiped as well great thank you
 
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative n vano followed
 
00:26:07.389 --> 00:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
by representative priest thank you madam
 
00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:09.919 align:start position:0%
chair a a quick question not not a lot
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
of detail but the front-end process of
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
what's the time frame involved for
 
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
identifying kinship uh uh Alternatives
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
and then the licensing process what what
 
00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:25.559 align:start position:0%
is the timeline on that look like um
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
things move very quickly at DCF um so
 
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
when we determine um that a child is in
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
danger and needs to be removed from
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
their home uh we're immediately talking
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
with caregivers with the child trying to
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
identify important people in a child's
 
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
life um it's certainly our preference to
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
place with kin um over foster care so
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
we're working immediately um even before
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
oftentimes um danger is identified to
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
try to talk with families about if your
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
child couldn't be with you who are the
 
00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
important people in in your child's life
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
um so we do some of that proactive
 
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
planning in our investigative process
 
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
and then the timeline for licensing um
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
it can be very quickly we have um the
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
ability to um do some initial steps
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
around safety some background checks
 
00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
some police checks some things that will
 
00:27:14.669 --> 00:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
happen very quickly so that in a matter
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
of days we could be providing payment to
 
00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
that Foster Family while they continue
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
to go through the rest of the
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
process okay and a very quick follow up
 
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
on I think uh uh representative walner
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh question so the the difference is it
 
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
exactly the same funding for for kinship
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
as it is for It Foster
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
you representative priest for a
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chairman um
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
with all of these key
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
accomplishments uh do you have or has it
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
been done any dollar assessment of the
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
money that has been saved to the agency
 
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
because of these new
 
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
programs like for instance transitioning
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
the uh children to Kin Care versus
 
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.430 align:start position:0%
the uh children to Kin Care versus
foster

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
foster
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
care so in in that example we're still
 
00:28:14.909 --> 00:28:14.919 align:start position:0%
paying families to be able to provide
 
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
for that care the same amount yes okay
 
00:28:21.549 --> 00:28:21.559 align:start position:0%
yes um you know I I think what we're
 
00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
what we're hoping to see over time is a
 
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
transition uh you know as I go through
 
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
our resident as I go through our
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
strategic priorities you'll see a focus
 
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
on trying to reduce Reliance on
 
00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:33.519 align:start position:0%
residential treatment so we believe once
 
00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:35.799 align:start position:0%
we can do some of that that we will see
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
that we can transition funds um into
 
00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
more community- Based Services What's
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
hard to predict is the intensity of
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
children's needs so we know that coming
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
you know in a postco world that we're
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
seeing youth with higher uh mental
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
health needs um and and just greater
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
Acuity and so we've not reached that
 
00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:57.559 align:start position:0%
reached that Tipping Point yet where
 
00:28:59.509 --> 00:28:59.519 align:start position:0%
we're a ble to see that reduction in
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
residential treatment but we do believe
 
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
over time
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
um that it's possible that we can
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
repurpose those funds into Community
 
00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:15.549 align:start position:0%
repurpose those funds into Community
Based

00:29:15.549 --> 00:29:15.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
care um the final rectangular box on
 
00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
Slide Five is just additional support
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
for transition aged Youth and so we have
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
our hope program which stands for
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
housing and opportunities to personally
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
Excel and through this service we're
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
seeing that voluntary foster care to 21
 
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
um is available uh for kids who were in
 
00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:39.919 align:start position:0%
our state custody at age 18 and who
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
volunteer to extend care um we've
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
provided that to 13 we have a service
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
called Youth Villages life set which is
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
life skills Education and Training and
 
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
we provided that opportunity to 205
 
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
youth in state fiscal year 2024 which
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
was up uh from State fiscal year
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
2023 and then we've continued our
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with housing authorities
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
for fostering youth Independence housing
 
00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:09.519 align:start position:0%
vouchers um and through this effort we
 
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
uh partner with local and state um
 
00:30:13.149 --> 00:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
agencies and we connect young adults
 
00:30:15.789 --> 00:30:15.799 align:start position:0%
underage 24 to vouchers so that they can
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
vouchers representative n van go for a
 
00:30:24.669 --> 00:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
question yes yes thank you madam chair
 
00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
so what are the overall uh demographic
 
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
of the populations you serve look like
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
how does you know if you if you have any
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
information on that so we serve children
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
um we can serve children through um our
 
00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
child protection Juvenile Justice
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
typically 0 through 18 and there are
 
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities to extend um as as I just
 
00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
shared for that um hope program we have
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
extended foster care so for youth who
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
would like some additional assistance
 
00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
launching into adulthood who were
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
involved in our system at age 18 we can
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
continue to do that up to age 23 we have
 
00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:04.039 align:start position:0%
some Services um and Community Resources
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
available through age 26 so we certainly
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
want to stick by youth to make sure that
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
we can launch them into adulthood um
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
into independent adults um and certainly
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
we serve um families uh adults all
 
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
across the state who are parents to
 
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
their children just just a quick
 
00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:22.519 align:start position:0%
followup and I was talking about I I
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
think more trying to get a feel for so
 
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
the split between the youth that you're
 
00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:29.559 align:start position:0%
you're Serv serving so in those various
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
categories it concentrated on the front
 
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:33.799 align:start position:0%
end concentrated on the higher end of
 
00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
the scale and then more importantly uh
 
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
the split between male female uh in in
 
00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:40.990 align:start position:0%
the split between male female uh in in
the

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:42.629 --> 00:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
demographics I don't have the
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
demographics with me today regarding
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
male and female uh youth um that your
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
sense of things that that um uh it's
 
00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
skewed one way or the other no I I don't
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
think I could answer that I I think
 
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps our Juvenile Justice population
 
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
um and and at our secure treatment
 
00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
facility is um probably 2third male uh
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
oneir female um but for a child
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
protection I would say it's probably
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
close to
 
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.629 --> 00:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
welcome moving on to slide six uh this
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
is where I have outlined our DF
 
00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
strategic priorities and it's really
 
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
important that I let you know the work
 
00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:32.919 align:start position:0%
that we're doing looking into the future
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
the improvements that we want to see in
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
our DCF system so within the center of
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
the slide you'll see a circle and in the
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
in that Circle and it's color
 
00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
coordinated but those are our four
 
00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
strategic priorities for 2025 and 2026
 
00:32:50.909 --> 00:32:50.919 align:start position:0%
and they're focused on our case practice
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
building our new secure treatment
 
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
facility developing our new electronic
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
case management system and focused on
 
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
ensuring we have a robust service
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
array in particular I I also want to
 
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
talk about the the the squares on the
 
00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
outside of the circle so following the
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
practice the the navy color so we have
 
00:33:13.149 --> 00:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
some strategies in place activities in
 
00:33:15.549 --> 00:33:15.559 align:start position:0%
place to focus on fine-tuning our case
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
practice and through those efforts We
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
Believe will reduce the percentage of
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
Youth and residential treatment and then
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
subsequently will increase the
 
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
percentage of foster youth who live in
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
family settings kinship relative and
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
Foster family
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
homes following around the circle to the
 
00:33:33.629 --> 00:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
right our new secure treatment facility
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
will be open by December of
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
2026 all employees will be trained in
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
our trauma informed care and the census
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
will not exceed 12 youth at any point in
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
time moving down to our electronic case
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
management system this new system it
 
00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
will be called Granite families we do
 
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
have a question Sor no problem is this
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
flow okay for you absolutely pleas stop
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
me representative tarki for a question
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
yes just a quick question on that
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
statement that the census will never
 
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
exceed 12 youth is how can you guarantee
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
that or what's your plan to make sure
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
that sure that's the case there's a lot
 
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
of work to be done to ensure that uh we
 
00:34:15.069 --> 00:34:15.079 align:start position:0%
know our legislative mandate is not to
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
exceed 12 um our Juvenile Justice
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
transformation effort has gone a long
 
00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
way to to show us that there is a
 
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
currently a reduction in use of um syc
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
and we have a group that's come together
 
00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
um involving a variety of Community
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
Resources um law enforcement courts um
 
00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
folks from DCF from children's
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health uh from the Pearle
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
board um we have prosecutors we have
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
defense Council present so we know that
 
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
this is going to take a community effort
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
to figure out what else is available for
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
youth in particular detained youth um
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
and even a subset of detained youth are
 
00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
this the subset of Youth um who are
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
detained after hours during the night
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
what else can we create that's available
 
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:02.200 align:start position:0%
for cool off periods um it could be that
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
something happened in the family home
 
00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
but perhaps with a little planning with
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
the right service with the right kind of
 
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
foster home we could eliminate the need
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
for after hours um youth being detained
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
at syc so we have some areas of focus
 
00:35:16.589 --> 00:35:16.599 align:start position:0%
but it will certainly take a
 
00:35:16.599 --> 00:35:23.910 align:start position:0%
but it will certainly take a
collaborative

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:26.440 align:start position:0%
effort um in the purple our electronic
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
case management system will be called
 
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
Granite families and we intend to have
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
that live by December of 26th it will
 
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
replace our um
 
00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
1997 uh case management system called
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
Bridges um which uh is certainly not an
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
up-to-date um technological um option
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
for us and so we anticipate lots of new
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
efficiencies and are excited to have a
 
00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
new system that will help our case
 
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
workers have a place uh to document the
 
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
work they do with families in an
 
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
efficient way so that they can spend
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh moving to the final area which is the
 
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
green section which is our service array
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
we hope to see an increase of children
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
served in their own homes um and
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
increase foster home availability for
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
children in particular we have a gold a
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
goal around um the 14 to 17 year old
 
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
population um which is that same
 
00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:22.599 align:start position:0%
population that's uh mostly at syc that
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
same population that might be over
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
represented in residential treatment so
 
00:36:29.309 --> 00:36:29.319 align:start position:0%
we want make sure that we have a a
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
robust array of um Foster family homes
 
00:36:34.309 --> 00:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
and we're still focused on kinship care
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
but for that 14 to 17y Old
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
population Miss dunan are we how are we
 
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
doing in terms of foster families um are
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
we at 100% are we at 90% if you had to
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
guess in terms of availability of those
 
00:36:52.309 --> 00:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
who are trained and ready to go as
 
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
Foster families where are
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
we so foster family availability is a is
 
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
a difficult question so uh we certainly
 
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
have um you know we've got almost 500
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
foster homes across the state who are
 
00:37:08.349 --> 00:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
available um with more beds than than
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
that number of homes what's challenging
 
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
about foster care is that there has to
 
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
be a match between the skills and
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
capacity of the family and the unique
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
needs of the child so it isn't a one for
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
one so we can't take any child and out
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
of home care and say that's one child
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
there's one bed here let's make that
 
00:37:29.309 --> 00:37:29.319 align:start position:0%
connection it has to be a family that's
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable that feels skilled that
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
feels confident and competent and their
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
capacity to serve whatever uh needs um
 
00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:38.599 align:start position:0%
come with the youth so I don't know that
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
I would ever say we're at 100% capacity
 
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
of our foster care availability
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
certainly we we're recruiting we have a
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
fabulous um employee who is who is
 
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
fairly new to dcyf and is doing a great
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
job in recruitment uh we also want to
 
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
make sure we're doing a good job in
 
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
retaining Foster family and caregivers
 
00:37:59.230 --> 00:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
by supporting them by giving them the
 
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
right Services by meeting with them
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
hearing them making sure they're a
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
partner at the table that's actually a
 
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
goal in our priorities um so do we have
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
availability yes is it always a Apples
 
00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
to Apples fit for the needs of
 
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
particular Children and Youth no and so
 
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
we always are going to need to keep
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
recruiting we've got large sibling
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
groups some people want to take smaller
 
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
children we've got teenagers available
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
some people want a sibling group of two
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
we've got sibling groups of four right
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
so it has to be the right match so I
 
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
don't know that would ever be at 100%
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
capacity thank you for the detailed
 
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:36.200 align:start position:0%
question representative Nano yesk
 
00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:38.839 align:start position:0%
detailed answer representative Neno very
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
quick uh question how often do you do
 
00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
you find mismatches in in that uh
 
00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
program where you match somebody with a
 
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
a foster I mean Foster or kinship either
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
either way what what kind of a mismatch
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
rate do you have and how how do you
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
address those I don't know that I have a
 
00:38:59.870 --> 00:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
percentage for you but certainly we have
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
um kids disrupt uh from Foster family
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
and and kinship settings uh we try to
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
look at those and and make sure we think
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
of it um you know from a quality
 
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
assurance aspect in terms of did we
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
provide the right service are there
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
different services available that might
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
have maintained that child in youth what
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
are we learning about that youth
 
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes youth come into care and we
 
00:39:23.309 --> 00:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
think we understand the youth's needs
 
00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
and as kids get comfortable um either we
 
00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:29.319 align:start position:0%
see symptoms exacerbate sometimes we see
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
them stabilize so it's always an
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to better understand what a
 
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
child's needs is and also to provide
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
training to foster care parents so
 
00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
disruptions certainly happen um and we
 
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:41.720 align:start position:0%
always hope that we learn from them and
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
and try to minimize that and know
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
exactly what the child would need the
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
next in the next home okay thank you
 
00:39:47.839 --> 00:39:49.309 align:start position:0%
next in the next home okay thank you
thank

00:39:49.309 --> 00:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
you representative walner for a question
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I've been sort of looking
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
ahead to in the uh uh presentation to
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
see if there is any mention of adoption
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
and can you remind us of what the um
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines are around when a child ends
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
up in a situation where they're uh
 
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
they're terminate their family is
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
terminated sure yep so for each child
 
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
that comes into out of Home Care um we
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
have legislative requirements that we
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
have 12 months to work with the with the
 
00:40:28.109 --> 00:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
family of origin to try to to rectify
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
and remediate the concerns that brought
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
the child to our attention so there are
 
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
um continual court hearing reviews uh
 
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
we're continuing to work a case plan
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
with the family we're meeting with the
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
child the family any service providers
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
um we're we're involved in treatment
 
00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
meetings IEP and educational meetings so
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
our case managers our case workers are
 
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
constantly working with families over
 
00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
the course of that 12 months um when a
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
child first comes into out of Home Care
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
reunification is the primary goal we're
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
also obligated to identify a concurrent
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
goal so sometimes that's adoption
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
depending on the the needs what we know
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
about the family how the the age of the
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
child what we um what we can anticipate
 
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
might happen um most often um adoption
 
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
is the concurrent goal because that's
 
00:41:20.829 --> 00:41:20.839 align:start position:0%
the most um permanent other option
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
available after
 
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
reunification and so over the course of
 
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
that 12 months we're working both
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
primary and concurrent goals um with the
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
Court's oversight when we get to about
 
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
nine months into the into the course of
 
00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
a case we'll start to really think about
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
is does it look like permanency is
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
imminent over the next three months
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
should we be doing more around the
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
concurrent goal and then at the 12-month
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
Mark there's a specific court hearing
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
called a permanency hearing and at that
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
time we're obligated to recommend to the
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
court that we um adopt an Alterna
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
alternative permanency goal and then
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
work toward that goal and at that point
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
it could be termination of parental
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
rights as recommended and then we would
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
adoption do you have a statistic of how
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
many children um in the past year have
 
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
gone into
 
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
adoption I don't have that on on the top
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
of my head I can get that for you um
 
00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
certainly more children reunify than
 
00:42:22.589 --> 00:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
than go to adoption but I can get that
 
00:42:38.549 --> 00:42:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
moving to slide
 
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
seven this is a visual of what we
 
00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
anticipate or where our goal will be as
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
a result of the priorities that I I
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
talked about in the prior slide and so
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
you'll see here that our our overarching
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
goal is to serve families with the
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
lightest touch possible and if we stop
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
at the bottom Circle which starts with
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
Central intake um I talked about that
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
Community Navigator program that's
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
available so we hope that we're able to
 
00:43:09.309 --> 00:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
stop a family's um I don't know if I
 
00:43:09.319 --> 00:43:15.630 align:start position:0%
stop a family's um I don't know if I
should

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
pause that's okay I just wanted to pause
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
I wasn't sure um you'll see our if if a
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
family comes to our attention at Central
 
00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
intake we hope that that's the only
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
involvement they have with our agency
 
00:43:28.549 --> 00:43:28.559 align:start position:0%
we're giving out referrals we're giving
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
out information we can refer the
 
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
reporter or their family to the
 
00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:33.800 align:start position:0%
community Navigator program so then
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
you'll see that stop sign we hope to
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
stop a family there if the information
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
requires us to do an investigation or an
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
assessment we can serve a family with
 
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
paid Services right through our
 
00:43:47.549 --> 00:43:47.559 align:start position:0%
investigative process and we hope that
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
they family will stop there at the
 
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
conclusion of our assessment I talked
 
00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
about those community- based voluntary
 
00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
services with outside case managers if
 
00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
that can be done again that could stop
 
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
the family from coming any more deeply
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
into our system than
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
necessary uh moving up to the third
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
circle if we do need to open a case if
 
00:44:08.549 --> 00:44:08.559 align:start position:0%
we can substantiate and and need to
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
substantiate abuse and neglect we hope
 
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
to serve that family in home with that
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
lightest touch possible keeping the
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
family intact providing those community-
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
Based Services to keep them
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
together if we have to have out of Home
 
00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:23.720 align:start position:0%
Care moving up to the second to the last
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
Circle we want to use kinship or foster
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
care options that communitybased care to
 
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
keep kids as close to home as possible
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
in community home settings um if that
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
can't be possible that Outer Circle
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
which is the deepest end of our system
 
00:44:41.549 --> 00:44:41.559 align:start position:0%
is residential treatment and you'll see
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
those arrows um on the on the left those
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
Navy arrows if we're using residential
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
that should be a shortterm episode of
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
treatment we want to step kids back down
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
to kinship or foster care and then step
 
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
them back down to their own homes where
 
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
we can maintain that family intact so
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
this is just serves as a visual to
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
outline for you um our goal to serve
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
families with that lightest touch
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
possible question representative tersi
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
for a question so knowing that um the
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
time in residential care is the goal is
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
very very short what is your average
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
stay then for children I don't have that
 
00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
today but I can certainly get that for
 
00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:20.200 align:start position:0%
you um today I would say it would be
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
longer than we would want it to be and
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
so that that's why these are goals
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
making sure we're assessing engaging
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
families we're we're talking with them
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
at the table we're understanding
 
00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
family's strengths and needs so that we
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
can build off those strengths work
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
through those needs um and get kids
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
moving through our system more quickly
 
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:37.720 align:start position:0%
but I can get that for you quick
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
followup would you say that it's days
 
00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
weeks or
 
00:45:43.549 --> 00:45:43.559 align:start position:0%
months I would say for the majority of
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
you the thing I'll say about Residential
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
Treatment too is that we know that that
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
will always be a necessary part of our
 
00:45:59.950 --> 00:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
service array Continuum those episodes
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
of treatment for those High Acuity youth
 
00:46:03.549 --> 00:46:03.559 align:start position:0%
that I I talked about that we're seeing
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
in a postco world so we anticipate
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
there'll be a continued need for
 
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
residential treatment but we want it to
 
00:46:12.549 --> 00:46:12.559 align:start position:0%
be treatment oriented as shortterm as
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
possible and that we're stepping kids
 
00:46:20.589 --> 00:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
can representative Stringham for a
 
00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
question yeah so would would you say
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
then people enter resid final treatment
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
and then they graduate out of it back to
 
00:46:30.599 --> 00:46:32.470 align:start position:0%
and then they graduate out of it back to
non-supported

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
non-supported
 
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
nonobserved or once they're in it are
 
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
they kind of in it so that would be our
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
goal is to make sure that we're stepping
 
00:46:41.309 --> 00:46:41.319 align:start position:0%
kids back through closing cases uh
 
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
reunifying families um there are some um
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
situations where youth have challenging
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
symptoms um we have some kids um who
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
have disabilities and will require
 
00:46:54.549 --> 00:46:54.559 align:start position:0%
long-term care we often work across the
 
00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
department with our long-term supports
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
and services
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
for some kids that might need adult care
 
00:47:02.109 --> 00:47:02.119 align:start position:0%
so it there is a a varying I I think I
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
kind of asked it backwards I'm kind of
 
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
meant you know once you're in home
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
treatment and you're finished with that
 
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
then the case is closed and you're no
 
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
longer you don't pick up the phone
 
00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:15.880 align:start position:0%
unless they call that's correct yep we
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
close out cases every day and uh connect
 
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
families with local Community Based
 
00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
Services and hope that they live
 
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
successful independent lives outside of
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
DCF represent res ative seaworth for a
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much um given
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
that you have this goal represented with
 
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
the circles here to keep um family and
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
children in the center by what
 
00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
methodology can you can you measure your
 
00:47:47.309 --> 00:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
success towards that goal so we have um
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
a full metrics
 
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't think I can provide to you um
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
we have a full metrics outlining all of
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
our activities around our strategic
 
00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
priorities with data points um for
 
00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
example residential treatment we hope
 
00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:02.599 align:start position:0%
that we'll see a reduction by 10% um
 
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
similarly we hope to see a 10% increase
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
um in the number of families served in
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
home uh we have percentages around um
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
numbers of foster home availability for
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
14 to 17 year olds so we have a whole
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
array of metrics that we'll use to
 
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
measure our success or our challenges
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
and we'll need to Pivot and and and
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
change up our strategy and figure out
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
that representative Daniels for a
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
question thank you after after
 
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
assessment you you need to take further
 
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
uh treatment like in home or or foster
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
care how long are those records kept if
 
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.789 --> 00:48:50.799 align:start position:0%
case I'm G to I want to get back to I I
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
I think perhaps it could if we had a
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
finding and we opened a case I believe
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
the records are currently kept
 
00:48:55.839 --> 00:48:57.470 align:start position:0%
the records are currently kept
indefinitely

00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
indefinitely
 
00:48:59.789 --> 00:48:59.799 align:start position:0%
and if it's unfounded if it's unfounded
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to correct myself um if
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
it's screened out it's retained for four
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
years um um and I think I will get back
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
to around if it's if it's if it's um if
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's unfounded let me get back to on
 
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
that so that I'm confident in the
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
response can you define what screened
 
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
outt means yes it means a call that
 
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
comes to our hotline um but is
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
determined did not meet criteria for an
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
investigation okay so you hold that for
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
four years that's correct but but if you
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
go through a case that's unfounded then
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's when you're going to get back to
 
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
me I'm going to get back to if it's
 
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
uh moving on to slide eight this is our
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
first Bureau that we'll review it's our
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
Bureau of field
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
services um and this is the Bureau that
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
most people uh think of when they think
 
00:50:16.789 --> 00:50:16.799 align:start position:0%
of DCF it's it's our it's our case
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
workers it's our Central intake hotline
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
it's our child protective services and
 
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
Services on slide
 
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
nine you'll see that we're going to move
 
00:50:33.069 --> 00:50:33.079 align:start position:0%
into the accounting unit
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
um and we're on page 847 of the
 
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
governor's budget at this point um and
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 1896 our dcyf emergency
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
funds um we use these for unexpected
 
00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
costs for families things that are
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
outside of our service array um so it
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
could be things like um a car repair or
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
a bill that needs to be paid in order to
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
allow the family to stay intact so it's
 
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
not a service provider coming in but
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
it's an unexpected cost um that is
 
00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
unable to be paid otherwise um in in
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
another part of the the community or the
 
00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
system but enables a family to stay
 
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
together by being able to pay
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
that uh moving into accounting unit
 
00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
2957 um this is our child protective
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
workers um so we've got almost 300 case
 
00:51:26.829 --> 00:51:26.839 align:start position:0%
workers across the state um our Child
 
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
Protection staff are mobile they're
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
field-based um they're meeting with
 
00:51:33.309 --> 00:51:33.319 align:start position:0%
families they're meeting with treatment
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
providers um education meetings Court
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
hearings so there's significant amounts
 
00:51:41.549 --> 00:51:41.559 align:start position:0%
of travel uh we're available 247 on call
 
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
to respond to imminent danger of
 
00:51:46.789 --> 00:51:46.799 align:start position:0%
children um so we've got our overtime
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
line there um you supporting supporting
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
Children and Youth uh 24 hours a day
 
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
it looks as though on page
 
00:52:03.309 --> 00:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
849 where that accounting unit is
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
described that there is a reduction of
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
positions 30 or so that's fairly
 
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
substantial uh any expansion you want to
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
make on that sure uh 29 of those
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
positions were moved to accounting unit
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
3443 and two positions were moved to
 
00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
2956 and and and we'll be we'll be going
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
through that where we can talk about the
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
the changes when we arrive at that
 
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
accounting unit if that works but um
 
00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
those positions and the Personnel cost
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
were were moved uh through there so
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
there was no positions abolished uh
 
00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:41.240 align:start position:0%
during this during this phase of the
 
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
question get this closer here we go on
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
you skipped over page
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
848 the director's office and I see that
 
00:52:59.390 --> 00:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
the personnel line is down
 
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
considerably and the um
 
00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
positions are also
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
down so we will get to the office of the
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
director in another slide but we did
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
sorry that's okay we and and we did
 
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
again move positions to a different
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
accounting unit so there was no
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
reduction there okay there's no
 
00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:21.789 align:start position:0%
reduction there okay there's no
reduction

00:53:21.789 --> 00:53:21.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
just um I'm going to move to accounting
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
unit 2958 which is on page age 850 Madam
 
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
chair representative noveno for a
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you if I if I look on um
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
849 or line 102 where it has contracts
 
00:53:40.589 --> 00:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
for program Services is that another
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
case of where the money's been shifted
 
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
someplace else yes those dollars have
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:57.549 --> 00:53:57.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:59.910 --> 00:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
I'm moving to page 850 which is
 
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 2958 we're still on
 
00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:03.549 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 2958 we're still on
slide

00:54:03.549 --> 00:54:03.559 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
9 and and you'll see in this accounting
 
00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.789 align:start position:0%
9 and and you'll see in this accounting
unit

00:54:08.789 --> 00:54:08.799 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
um starting in class line 636 and moving
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
down this is um the majority of our uh
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
funding for our outof home care so our
 
00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
foster care placement um Broken Out by
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
eligibility uh needs and requirements
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
for children how those are paid our
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
adoption subsidies for children who have
 
00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
been adopted our Residential Treatment
 
00:54:32.109 --> 00:54:32.119 align:start position:0%
dollars um so this in this accounting
 
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
unit is where you see um our placement
 
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
costs and of course as as I mentioned um
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
having foster care placement um is an
 
00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:43.720 align:start position:0%
incredibly important service array uh
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
component that we that we have in our
 
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
robust array as is residential treatment
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
and while we hope to minimize that we we
 
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:51.640 align:start position:0%
know that there'll always be a need for
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
representative walner for a
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
question well on 636 and
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
637 it seems like there is a Hu a pretty
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
big increase on line 637 from the last
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:21.069 align:start position:0%
 
wondered

00:55:21.069 --> 00:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
63 yeah so that's on page 850 of the
 
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
s um so there there's there's a couple
 
00:55:40.829 --> 00:55:40.839 align:start position:0%
of things well can I just provide sort
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
of a broader uh context here so this is
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
certainly a unique uh accounting unit um
 
00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
when comparing it to many of the
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
accounting units um we've we've
 
00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
discussed and scen so far we break out
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
each type of service um here where we we
 
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
break it down by title 4E or title 4 a
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
tanif or state general funds so that we
 
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
can more accurately track the the types
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
of expenses um that are allowable and I
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
think what what is unique about also
 
00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
unique about this is one of the things
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to do in the budget is
 
00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:17.799 align:start position:0%
look at the costs we've incurred and
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
look at the cost that we're going to
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
incur but those costs are driven by the
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
unique needs of the child so if a child
 
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
qualifies for 4E or they qualify for
 
00:56:34.589 --> 00:56:34.599 align:start position:0%
tanif um that or it's 100% General funds
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
we can't necessarily predict what the
 
00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
future needs of those children are going
 
00:56:41.069 --> 00:56:41.079 align:start position:0%
to be so one thing that you will see in
 
00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
the regular Department wide transfer
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
three times a year we bring forward an
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
item to the fiscal committee where we
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
often move funds within this accounting
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
unit to adjust for those changes
 
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
throughout the year so we start with an
 
00:56:57.309 --> 00:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
initial assumption based on experience
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
that we've seen in the past and then we
 
00:57:00.349 --> 00:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
make adjustments so I I just kind of
 
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
want to put a little um just a little
 
00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:05.799 align:start position:0%
sort of asterisk on on this conversation
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
but representative walner to answer your
 
00:57:11.029 --> 00:57:11.039 align:start position:0%
question directly um we did have a
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
prioritized need that was funded in the
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
governor's phase relative to enhanced
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
foster care rates and I can go back and
 
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
verify but I believe we are seeing a
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
portion of that show up here and then we
 
00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
also saw if you look at um State fiscal
 
00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:33.390 align:start position:0%
also saw if you look at um State fiscal
year

00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
26 we also found that the experience um
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
in state fiscal year 26 was almost
 
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
approximately what we had budgeted so I
 
00:57:46.829 --> 00:57:46.839 align:start position:0%
think there's anticipation as Marie was
 
00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
discussing earlier about us trying to
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
kind of move down that large Circle
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
toward towards the less restrictive
 
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're in hoping and
 
00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:56.430 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're in hoping and
anticipating

00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
anticipating
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
higher utilization here ver versus
 
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
run I think you just answered my next
 
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:11.039 align:start position:0%
question but um does this budget include
 
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
any rate increases for foster
 
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
families sure so we submitted two
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs requests um one was an
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
enhanced foster care rate and that that
 
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
was in included and then we also
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
included a prioritize need request for
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
increased foster care rates more
 
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
standard rates um in the first year of
 
00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:39.160 align:start position:0%
the banum the enhanced foster care rates
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
was uh almost $700,000 total uh and it
 
00:58:45.309 --> 00:58:45.319 align:start position:0%
was the same in the second year the
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
increased foster care rates prioritized
 
00:58:51.789 --> 00:58:51.799 align:start position:0%
need that was not funded was just shy of
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
a a million dollar in each state fiscal
 
00:58:55.119 --> 00:58:59.390 align:start position:0%
a a million dollar in each state fiscal
year

00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
representative priest for a question
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
followed by representative tarki thank
 
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
you madam chairman
 
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
um on page 850 toward the bottom um you
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
have estimated source of funds for Child
 
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
and Family Services uh I'm could you
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
give an explanation on the agency income
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
and why there is no agency income for
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:42.230 align:start position:0%
 
2027

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
2027
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
sure I I think I need to look further
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
into that and and get back to you uh
 
00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
just to give you a floral response but I
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
I'll see if I can do that actively as
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
we're sitting here today uh as a
 
00:59:56.589 --> 00:59:56.599 align:start position:0%
followup on the educational trust fund
 
00:59:58.510 --> 00:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
I mean it was my understanding that
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
those monies those funds are supposed to
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
be used for
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
educational purposes and you have like
 
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
three million in each year um can you
 
01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.750 align:start position:0%
three million in each year um can you
explain

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
explain
 
01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:13.910 align:start position:0%
explain
that

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
yes yes so there was a bill that was
 
01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
passed during the state fiscal year 2024
 
01:00:22.109 --> 01:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
legislative session uh Senate Bill
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
463 Senate Bill 463 made a $3 million
 
01:00:29.029 --> 01:00:29.039 align:start position:0%
appropriation for State fiscal year 25
 
01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
in the amount of $3 million directed
 
01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:34.119 align:start position:0%
from the education trust fund um when
 
01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
the agency prepared its budget we
 
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
continued this practice as it was
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
originally envisioned and passed by the
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
legislature um and I would defer to the
 
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
committee whether there's a policy
 
01:00:47.549 --> 01:00:47.559 align:start position:0%
change in that
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
direction okay thank
 
01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
you representative tki followed by
 
01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
representative Nano before I get to my
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
first question do you know what the
 
01:00:57.630 --> 01:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
policy was for cabel
 
01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:00.029 align:start position:0%
policy was for cabel
463

01:01:00.029 --> 01:01:00.039 align:start position:0%
463
 
01:01:02.589 --> 01:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
oh actually I believe I misspoke I
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
believe it was HB 1588 H I can uh hang
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
that so uh this one was to increase the
 
01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
age from 21 to 22 uh for kids um in in
 
01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
in DCF care um if they have special
 
01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
education services yep thank you sorry
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
about that okay and then my original
 
01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.549 align:start position:0%
about that okay and then my original
question

01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
um was somewhat unrelated but talking
 
01:01:47.549 --> 01:01:47.559 align:start position:0%
about this population of children um
 
01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:49.720 align:start position:0%
when it comes to their medical care do
 
01:01:52.269 --> 01:01:52.279 align:start position:0%
they all get enrolled in Medicaid
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
regardless of what their family
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
situation is or how is that handled
 
01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:01.240 align:start position:0%
sure so so typically
 
01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.910 align:start position:0%
sure so so typically
um

01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:06.269 --> 01:02:06.279 align:start position:0%
the most children typically qualify for
 
01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:10.279 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that come in and um I I have an
 
01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
individual here who's told me in the
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
past typically what they do is sign them
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
up initially because most of the time
 
01:02:18.269 --> 01:02:18.279 align:start position:0%
they will be qualifying for Medicaid um
 
01:02:20.349 --> 01:02:20.359 align:start position:0%
unless and and and then they go through
 
01:02:22.349 --> 01:02:22.359 align:start position:0%
the process to verify that and then if
 
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
if they don't then they don't but but a
 
01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:27.559 align:start position:0%
vast majority many of the children do
 
01:02:31.269 --> 01:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
okay so you're using family income so is
 
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
there a chance that with our discussion
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
on Friday about premiums that you we may
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
have children affected as they enter
 
01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:41.240 align:start position:0%
into your care with the increased
 
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:43.720 align:start position:0%
premiums or the establishment of
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
premiums for some
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
families I think I'd need to look into
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
the answer for that the the state is is
 
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
paying for for these children as they
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
come into our care so I think I need to
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
consult with a couple of different
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
people to understand what the
 
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
implications would be there okay but
 
01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
just to clarify though when you talk
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
about if they're eligible you're using
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
the parents or the Guardians income to
 
01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
see if they're eligible no I'm seeing
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
sure so so they would be an out of home
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
placement so the parents income wouldn't
 
01:03:32.349 --> 01:03:32.359 align:start position:0%
apply at that
 
01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
point okay thank
 
01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
you representative walner actually I'm
 
01:03:42.029 --> 01:03:42.039 align:start position:0%
sorry representative representative
 
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
novano followed by representative walner
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so a question on
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
it looks to me on the agency income that
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
there's a a pretty significant shift
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
between what part of it comes from
 
01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
federal funds and what
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh portion is coming from the general
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
fund is there is there you know some
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
there as as far as an increase in
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
general funds well so I'm looking at the
 
01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
federal funds going from you know in uh
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 adjusted from 19 to
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
2022 uh on the federal and a general
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
fund from 4 3 to 53 so I'm looking at a
 
01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
disproportionate uh shift in the
 
01:04:32.109 --> 01:04:32.119 align:start position:0%
proportion of funding coming from the
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
federal versus the general state general
 
01:04:39.549 --> 01:04:39.559 align:start position:0%
funds sure so
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
the the experience that we've had in
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
this panium was that we've had to move
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
almost $10 million of General funds into
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
this account and there there's a couple
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
of reasons for that but the experience
 
01:04:56.829 --> 01:04:56.839 align:start position:0%
that we've had is that we have had um
 
01:04:59.470 --> 01:04:59.480 align:start position:0%
fewer scenarios where we've been able to
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
leverage other Federal funding sources
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
and we've seen a a highing a higher
 
01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
utilization of 100% General funds and
 
01:05:09.269 --> 01:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
again that's based on the unique
 
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances of the child and so when
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
we prepared our agency budget what we
 
01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
were trying to do is look at what the
 
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
experience has been look at how the
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
costs have been incurred and look at
 
01:05:21.549 --> 01:05:21.559 align:start position:0%
what federal sources we've been able to
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
leverage and um For Better or For Worse
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
we've seen an increase in in general
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
fund utilization um and what we've tried
 
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
to do here is reflect
 
01:05:36.029 --> 01:05:36.039 align:start position:0%
that so just a quick followup so um so
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
you're saying so for the previous B any
 
01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
well from 23 22 23 uh the trend line
 
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
would look pretty dramatic in in that
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
respect it just looks like a pretty big
 
01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
shift uh on the Assumption and you know
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
um I I I can I can follow up with with
 
01:06:15.269 --> 01:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
additional analyses and details to kind
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
of give a more thorough explanation on
 
01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
that if if if that would work for the
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
committee yeah I I think that's right
 
01:06:23.549 --> 01:06:23.559 align:start position:0%
because I'm interested to know whether
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
there's a you know something that has do
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
with the the federal funding changing or
 
01:06:34.269 --> 01:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
uh what exactly accounts for the sure I
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
I I mean one of the things that that we
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
talked about last on on Friday evening
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
was where we have a loss of of uh
 
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
federal revenue because the residential
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
contracts are budgeted in three
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
different locations they're budgeted in
 
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
the 7948 account within Medicaid they're
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
budgeted within 2958 as well as another
 
01:06:55.549 --> 01:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
account within the division for
 
01:06:58.269 --> 01:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health and we had talked
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
about the the loss of federal Medicaid
 
01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
dollars um in in certain instances
 
01:07:07.950 --> 01:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
relative to qualified residential
 
01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities and institutions
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
for mental disease where essentially if
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's over 16 beds uh we are not able to
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
claim Medicaid dollars for certain
 
01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:21.640 align:start position:0%
Services there and so because these
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
because these contracts um they they
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
collectively there's 15 of them they
 
01:07:29.789 --> 01:07:29.799 align:start position:0%
exceed $100 million annually cuz they
 
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
cross the three different accounting
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
units I think it's difficult to look at
 
01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
one accounting unit in isolation so I
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
think what may be best is if we work on
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
providing the committee an analysis that
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
shows the dollars across all three
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
accounts and how they tie out that that
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
will probably get to your to your
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
question a little more clearly than an
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
isolated conversation about one
 
01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
accounting unit where a contract shares
 
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
three three
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
yeah just a quick very quick followup to
 
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
that we had uh I forget which
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
presentation it was we were talking
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
about doing a better job of making sure
 
01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
that we were recovering everything that
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
was available to us on the from the
 
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
federal level and it sounds to me like
 
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're dealing with you
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
know three different U accounting units
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
on this U uh creates the opportunity for
 
01:08:23.789 --> 01:08:23.799 align:start position:0%
not fully uh
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
recovering um the the the accounting
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
structure is is is fairly unrelated to
 
01:08:32.349 --> 01:08:32.359 align:start position:0%
whether we claim the dollars or not that
 
01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
happens at a much more detail level I
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
mean this is the state budget there's a
 
01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
lot of things that happen behind the
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
scenes here so the be because our
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
contracts are are shared across multiple
 
01:08:47.309 --> 01:08:47.319 align:start position:0%
division areas we try to account for
 
01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
those dollars in multiple division areas
 
01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
but I think it's but that makes your job
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
difficult when you're trying to
 
01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:56.759 align:start position:0%
understand why this particular line is
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
changing when you don't have in in
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
Insider Vision into the other accting
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
units that are located 100 Pages away in
 
01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
the budget okay thank you I look forward
 
01:09:07.789 --> 01:09:07.799 align:start position:0%
to the some structure that makes that
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
easier to understand what's going on
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
there thank you representative walner
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
and then representative Stringham yes so
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
in the lines
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me what is included in
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
the lines of um on this page where are
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
the residential plac
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
basements the not kinship or not Foster
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
family but the residential are they in
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
here yeah so so uh
 
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
643 and um 644 are two locations but but
 
01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:46.359 align:start position:0%
what I can do with that analysis is I
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
can show you each accounting unit in
 
01:09:50.669 --> 01:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
each class line that are factored into
 
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
the residential
 
01:09:56.910 --> 01:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
contracts um so that you can and you'll
 
01:09:58.830 --> 01:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
be able to see that in a more detailed
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
manner if if that's
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
helpful just yes that would be helpful
 
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
and maybe a breakdown of how many
 
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
those kinship foster and residential I
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
mean that probably is in your slide deck
 
01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
someplace I'm sure I've already missed
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
it um I have one other question last
 
01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
year I brought in a bill pertaining to
 
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
children who were in foster care who
 
01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
have social
 
01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
security and we were told that the
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
state takes of the um Social Security
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
payment when the child enters care where
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
would I find that
 
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
income in in the budget I I believe
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's the agency income but that's
 
01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
where I want to go back and just verify
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
that okay and I see that you're
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
projecting none for this
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
coming vium that that's where I need to
 
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
go back and have a conversation
 
01:10:58.590 --> 01:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
understand why that looks like that okay
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
one other about um House Bill
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
661 um there was a report that we're
 
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
going to hopefully see in this committee
 
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh and talk about but in the report they
 
01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
refer to um the state of New Hampshire
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
being able to maybe claim more 4E
 
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
funds and I wonder if there's been any
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
um if the department has looked into
 
01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
that and whether we're pursuing
 
01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
that thank you yes uh we are um we are
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
pursuing that we have an active uh group
 
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
of departmental employees um it's a
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
complicated um if this then that if this
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
then that um sort of uh flow chart that
 
01:11:50.669 --> 01:11:50.679 align:start position:0%
is required um with the qrps um that uh
 
01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
Nathan described the qu um the
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
residential treatment programs uh with
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
the families first uh prevention and
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
services act uh in 2018 there the qrtp
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
was established the IMD Institute of
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
Mental diseases were established um
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
again where uh Nathan referenced um
 
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
homes that have more than 16 youth but
 
01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
part of that also outlined a specific
 
01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:14.679 align:start position:0%
flowchart of things that all needed to
 
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
be lined up in order to draw down the
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
for ref funding and I wish it were as
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
simple as if we just do this one thing
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
but right from contemplating residential
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
care and and children need a
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
comprehensive assessment of treatment
 
01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
did it happen in this time frame in this
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
way what was the outcome of that you
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
know moving right into do we have the
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
right court order with the right date
 
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
within the right time frame do we have
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
the right documentation at the right
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
time so there's a complicated flow that
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
we are actively working through in order
 
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we can draw down those
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
funds great thank you representative
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
Stringham for a question yeah you had
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned the 10 million in general
 
01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
funds was that the entire uh division 42
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
or was that uh just um uh this
 
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
particular department number sure so it
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
was just shy of 10 million for this
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
particular accounting unit we also had
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
to move about $3.5 million to the syc
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
budget um as well um is is there one
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
place where the entire um 42
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
division um uh sums and and breakout is
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
somehow yes on uh page
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
you moving to
 
01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
moving to slide
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
10 um this is the part of the Bureau of
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
field services which is focused on
 
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice um rather than child
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
protection and I'm on page
 
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
861 accounting unit
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
7905 um so in this um accounting unit we
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
see the the field staff for Juvenile
 
01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
Justice um and we see
 
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
um we see that we have 107 staff we
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
actually have zero vacancies oh I see a
 
01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
question uh sorry representative uh uh
 
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
Neno um I'm trying to get my I'm trying
 
01:14:39.149 --> 01:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
to get my head around the um increases
 
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
in the in the budget
 
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
so this is now in a you know covid
 
01:14:47.629 --> 01:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
postco and I'm looking at the page where
 
01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
we talked about all the accomplishments
 
01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
and the progress we're making in the
 
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
various areas uh with the circles and
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
everything else else uh are and I think
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
when we looked at uh page 17 where we
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
showed the trend lines so it looks to me
 
01:15:08.910 --> 01:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
like the trends are down to
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
stable uh and yet the some of the the
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
budget numbers are
 
01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
increasing so it's just a you know some
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
explanation to help me get my head
 
01:15:24.189 --> 01:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
around uh what's going on with the the
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
trends and the progress we're making on
 
01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
on the key accomplishment areas and the
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
and the fact that the budgetary side of
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
it is um doesn't seem to totally reflect
 
01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
that sure so I I think what's important
 
01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
to start with is as I've already
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned um we've had to move quite a
 
01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
bit of money into the budget and make
 
01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
adjustments and um and when we talk
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
about the city use Services Center you
 
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
know the budget that we had to work with
 
01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
was based off of a budget that was to
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
close um HB 49 of the 2023 legislative
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
session was an expedited bill that um
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
prevented the closure uh I believe it
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
was in March of 2023 and so when we
 
01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
entered the house phase in the last
 
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
budget that that particular accounting
 
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
unit was based on a closed amount and
 
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
then we actually saw a million dollar
 
01:16:18.990 --> 01:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
reduction during the house phase so it's
 
01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
not necessarily an Apples to Apples
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
comparison when when you're when you're
 
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
looking at the at the current budgeted
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
amounts because it doesn't Express the
 
01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
specific need and so what we've tried to
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
do um you know both with the the changes
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
in the qrtp IMD issue as well as what
 
01:16:39.070 --> 01:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
we've seen and experience relative to
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
the needs with the Su new use Services
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
Center is make those adjustments we also
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
one important thing to understand about
 
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
the DCF budget it is heavily personnel
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
and there was uh you know the 10% and
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
then the subsequent 2% increase
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
in salary costs as a result of the raise
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
and then there's also been some
 
01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
increases and I believe in the range of
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
seven or more percent each year relative
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
to benefits and so when you have a a
 
01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
division area that is heavily Personnel
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
based or also going to see those adjust
 
01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
those increases but what you don't see
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
in the current operating budget is those
 
01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
pay raises were not included those pay
 
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
raises were included in hb2 so again
 
01:17:24.669 --> 01:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
it's you just need to recognize the fact
 
01:17:26.189 --> 01:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
that that if if you're looking at
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
chapter 106 laws of 2023 and the
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
operating budget there versus the
 
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
operating budget today it's not
 
01:17:35.709 --> 01:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
necessarily easy to draw that comparison
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
so so there's a couple of different
 
01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.830 align:start position:0%
so so there's a couple of different
drivers

01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
drivers
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
there I I think that may be an
 
01:17:43.149 --> 01:17:43.159 align:start position:0%
understatement that it's not easy to
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:54.990 --> 01:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
you staying in uh Bureau Field Services
 
01:17:58.110 --> 01:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
um accounting unit 7906 on page
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
862 um you'll see here
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
um that we are funding uh with mostly
 
01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
federal funds um a number of contracts
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
um our Child and Adolescent needs and
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
strengths um assessment tool which
 
01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
ensures that um is part of the
 
01:18:17.709 --> 01:18:17.719 align:start position:0%
assessment process in our Juvenile
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
Justice transformation and ensures that
 
01:18:21.870 --> 01:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
we're serving uh youth at the Right
 
01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
Touch um in community based care uh or
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
service whenever possible um our
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
restorative practices around ensuring
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
that youth have some accountability to
 
01:18:35.550 --> 01:18:35.560 align:start position:0%
their their victims um we have uh legal
 
01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
consultation here for uh youth
 
01:18:39.629 --> 01:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
contemplating the assessment outside of
 
01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
the system so that if they want to be
 
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
able to consult with an attorney before
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
agreeing uh to that process they're able
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
to do so um so some of the uh funds in
 
01:18:51.629 --> 01:18:51.639 align:start position:0%
7906 um cover those uh kinds of
 
01:18:51.639 --> 01:18:56.510 align:start position:0%
7906 um cover those uh kinds of
contracts

01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:58.830 --> 01:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh beginning on slide 11 uh we have some
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
data uh to to demonstrate some of the
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
work in in in that field services Bureau
 
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
so on page 11 you're seeing the total
 
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
calls to our Central intake
 
01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
line you're seeing there's a slight
 
01:19:13.470 --> 01:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
decrease in total calls for State fiscal
 
01:19:17.229 --> 01:19:17.239 align:start position:0%
year 2024 at the very top of that slide
 
01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
um the bottom section shows the outcome
 
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
of the call by screen in and that's the
 
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
pink line and those that are are those
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
are uh calls that are investigated for
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect uh by our case workers um
 
01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
those that are screened out which is the
 
01:19:36.990 --> 01:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
blue line and so those are not sent for
 
01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
investigation and additional information
 
01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
uh which is the um yellow uh line and
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
the additional information are calls
 
01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:47.560 align:start position:0%
received by Central intake that do not
 
01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
meet criteria for abuse neglect um but
 
01:19:52.629 --> 01:19:52.639 align:start position:0%
we are otherwise already involved with
 
01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
the family so that um information is
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
passed on to the casew worker just as
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
awareness so in that reddish color with
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
the report screened in um you'll also
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
see that there's a decrease in screened
 
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
in calls by over a thousand and so sub
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
subsequently you'll see the number of
 
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
screened out calls then has also
 
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
increased and and this is a good Trend
 
01:20:19.870 --> 01:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
this is positive we want less families
 
01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
being called into DCF um and getting
 
01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
into this deep end of the system uh we
 
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
want our system of care outside of our
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
system to be working for families to
 
01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
have alternatives to meeting their
 
01:20:32.669 --> 01:20:32.679 align:start position:0%
family needs um and not to have the only
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
path available um is is dcyf for them so
 
01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:38.440 align:start position:0%
this is evidence of the legislature
 
01:20:41.229 --> 01:20:41.239 align:start position:0%
support around the system of care um and
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
we're seeing we're seeing that that
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
happen representative Nell vano for a
 
01:20:48.669 --> 01:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
question yeah again again here I'm
 
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
seeing you know the positive results of
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know your key accomplishments in in
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
terms of to some of these uh measures
 
01:20:58.110 --> 01:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
and metrics but you know I'm having a
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
hard time relating it to what's
 
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
happening with the with the overall cost
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
structure but anyhow that you know we've
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
already covered that with some uh you
 
01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
know request for some additional
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
additional information it will help us
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
sort out the the fruit salad and maybe
 
01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
be able to picture apples oranges and
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
other things that are in
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
there moving to slide 12 um this shows a
 
01:21:25.709 --> 01:21:25.719 align:start position:0%
trend over calendar years to 24 of
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
screened in reports so again those calls
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
that come to intake that do meet
 
01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:31.719 align:start position:0%
criteria for investigation for abuse
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
neglect um and you'll see that um each
 
01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
year follows a similar Trend um lowers
 
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
um of screened in reports are are fewer
 
01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
in the summer months um you'll also note
 
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
the pink trend line for calendar year 24
 
01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
shows a decrease in screened in reports
 
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
by month um over the past
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
years representative tki for question a
 
01:21:54.189 --> 01:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
quick question looking on the seta would
 
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
you say that that's due to the child
 
01:21:58.870 --> 01:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
being in school and schools being such a
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
vital part of protection of children
 
01:22:05.709 --> 01:22:05.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
definitely moving to slide
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
13 once a call is screened in it sent on
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
for our investigators our our case
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
workers um at the district office level
 
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
to investigate and so you're seeing here
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
the average assessments assigned per
 
01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
cpsw from 2024 in December to December
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
of 2024
 
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a fairly steady Trend a
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
few dips here and there but fairly
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
steady our our case load goal is 12
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
active investigations per case worker um
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
and that goal was established back in
 
01:22:40.510 --> 01:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
2019 when we had received um a
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
additional uh case worker positions uh
 
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
We've not we've not quite reached that
 
01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
goal but um but we've we've hovered
 
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
occasions slide 14 shows the open cases
 
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
so once our investigators have made the
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
determination um if we need to open a
 
01:23:02.350 --> 01:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
case here is where we're looking at the
 
01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
data of open cases um so the top of
 
01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
slide 14 shows shows that number of open
 
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
cases for our family service case
 
01:23:11.669 --> 01:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
workers um you see a very minimal
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
increase in open cases since 2021 by
 
01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
less than 50 between State fiscal years
 
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
22 and
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
24 and so this reinforces something
 
01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
we're seeing which is that the families
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
coming to our ention have greater needs
 
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
right cuz we so we're seeing um uh fewer
 
01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
calls but we're not seeing necessarily
 
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
um a significant drop in cases so those
 
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
those calls coming to our attention um
 
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
are are families that have greater needs
 
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
um the bottom portion of this slide
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
shows the numbers of children served so
 
01:23:46.629 --> 01:23:46.639 align:start position:0%
the pink being the total served when you
 
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
combine in home and in placement the
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
blue breaking it down by children in
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
placement and the gold being children in
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
home and the green prevention cases are
 
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
those uh children being served um
 
01:24:03.390 --> 01:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
outside of DCF through our community-
 
01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
services on slide
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
15 you're showing um you're seeing a
 
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
promising Trend in the past in the past
 
01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh 90 days essentially since November of
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
2024 we've seen a 7% decrease in
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
children served in out of Home Care and
 
01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
then inversely a 7% increase in children
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
served in their own homes so that's a
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
trend that we want to see um and would
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.030 --> 01:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
direction on slide 16 you're seeing our
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
family service case load so these are
 
01:24:46.830 --> 01:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
cases so this is the trend of the
 
01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:51.719 align:start position:0%
average number of open cases per per
 
01:24:54.750 --> 01:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
case worker from December of 2021 to
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
December of 2024 and the goal here is 10
 
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
Again established in 2019 with our
 
01:25:03.310 --> 01:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 6 case worker positions at
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
that time um we're seeing stability over
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
time and typically about 12 to 13 cases
 
01:25:09.239 --> 01:25:14.950 align:start position:0%
time and typically about 12 to 13 cases
per

01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:17.229 --> 01:25:17.239 align:start position:0%
worker representative tarki for a
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
question thank you I'm looking at how
 
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
this goes back to the end of 21 and
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
while it's relatively St
 
01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
don't see really any reduction and over
 
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
the last few years I know that that was
 
01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully a goal so what is still
 
01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
holding you up in this well I think this
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
is this is um similar to what I
 
01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned where we're seeing fewer calls
 
01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
to intake um so what this says to me
 
01:25:44.109 --> 01:25:44.119 align:start position:0%
though is the calls that are coming in
 
01:25:47.109 --> 01:25:47.119 align:start position:0%
have greater needs um certainly we we
 
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
need legal criteria to open cases and
 
01:25:53.109 --> 01:25:53.119 align:start position:0%
Court oversight and so um the the needs
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
of families is greater than it than it
 
01:25:55.199 --> 01:26:02.390 align:start position:0%
of families is greater than it than it
was

01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
thanks slide 17 we did uh take a look at
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
already that was our Juvenile Justice um
 
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
youth served um in home and through our
 
01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
Treatment slide 18 shows the average
 
01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
number of cases assigned per juvenile
 
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
officer so the numbers stayed fairly
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
consistent despite that JJ assessment
 
01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:31.070 align:start position:0%
consistent despite that JJ assessment
process

01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
um and and again I think it's it's
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
similar that and and we saw that on the
 
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
last slide where uh we're seeing that
 
01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
dip in inhome cases for the assessment
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
process we also know that some of our
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
jpos are involved in in carrying those
 
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
assessment cases um and also carrying
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
permanency cases to ensure that uh our
 
01:26:53.629 --> 01:26:53.639 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice youth are um getting to
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
permanency as as quickly as possible so
 
01:26:57.109 --> 01:26:57.119 align:start position:0%
we're we're seeing fairly consistent
 
01:26:59.229 --> 01:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
numbers here as well representative
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
Daniels for a question yeah thank you on
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
an average how long does it take to
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
case it certainly dependent if it's an
 
01:27:11.109 --> 01:27:11.119 align:start position:0%
inhome or outof home case um so
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
typically about a year or less is is
 
01:27:16.350 --> 01:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
would be a potential Target for an
 
01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
inhome uh case where the family remains
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
together um but again there's attorneys
 
01:27:24.189 --> 01:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
involved um for Juvenile Justice
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
representing the youth there's a there's
 
01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
the court oversight process ultimately
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
orders the closure of a case once it's
 
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
open so it's dependent on a number of
 
01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:34.280 align:start position:0%
factors but a year could be a nice
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
Target thank
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
you representative Nano for a question
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much um a quick
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
question on of the cases you close how
 
01:27:48.270 --> 01:27:48.280 align:start position:0%
many do you have to
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
reopen I don't have that data with me is
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
I mean minimal or is it uh you know a
 
01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
handful or you
 
01:27:58.590 --> 01:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
know I think it's I think it's fairly
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's less than the number that come
 
01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
in um at the onset I I think it's it's
 
01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
fairly minimal um but I I don't have
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
that exact data with me but certainly
 
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
when we close a case we connect families
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
with their communities um with the
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
services that they can access
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
independent of dcyf um so more often
 
01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
than not they're they're able to
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
function independently without our
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
on slide 19 is the agency um count of
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
Youth and outof home
 
01:28:38.709 --> 01:28:38.719 align:start position:0%
care and you'll see the the pink line is
 
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
2024 um and overall we're looking at
 
01:28:47.310 --> 01:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
um uh from 2021 to 2024 is the
 
01:28:49.709 --> 01:28:49.719 align:start position:0%
span and so that that pink line being
 
01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
2024 you're seeing a promising Trend um
 
01:28:55.229 --> 01:28:55.239 align:start position:0%
and I showed this um in an earlier slide
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
with the with the child protection as
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
well in the decrease of the number of
 
01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
children served out of their homes since
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
data on slide 20 um this is our our
 
01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
kinship data that I that I um
 
01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
highlighted earlier and so um this is
 
01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
children where they're placed in outof
 
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
home care and also count of children is
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%
there on the access um so what's really
 
01:29:30.510 --> 01:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
exciting here is that gold kinship um
 
01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
care line and the pink is the foster
 
01:29:35.109 --> 01:29:35.119 align:start position:0%
care trend line and so you're you're
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
really starting to see a division um
 
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
since last fall between numbers of
 
01:29:42.270 --> 01:29:42.280 align:start position:0%
children served in kinship care um as
 
01:29:44.830 --> 01:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to foster care um and so we're
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
we're really excited to see the the the
 
01:29:49.229 --> 01:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
disparity growing there we we certainly
 
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
want more kids served in kinship care um
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
and then the blue trend line is showing
 
01:29:55.629 --> 01:29:55.639 align:start position:0%
the resident IAL treatment um line which
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
stable on slide 21 uh we're moving into
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
our syc budget our sunun use Services
 
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
budget um this is on page
 
01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
864 um on the governor's budget and
 
01:30:25.149 --> 01:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
so the new you Services Center is our is
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
our secure uh treatment facility for for
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
for youth in New Hampshire um we are
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
certainly seeing a decrease in our
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
census and I have um other slides for
 
01:30:41.229 --> 01:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
that coming up in a moment um and we're
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
building our new facility um which
 
01:30:47.149 --> 01:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
should be opened in Hamstead um by late
 
01:30:50.590 --> 01:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
summer early fall of 2026 um so that
 
01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
process is in place um the number of
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
kids serving there is certainly declined
 
01:30:57.390 --> 01:30:57.400 align:start position:0%
over time we're we're seeing typical
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
range of about 12 to 18 youth at any
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
given time um we ensure that we have an
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate Staffing pattern that allows
 
01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
for the safety of Youth and staff uh we
 
01:31:12.910 --> 01:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
tend to um during awake hours on on
 
01:31:15.149 --> 01:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
first shift we have 14 uh youth
 
01:31:18.189 --> 01:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
counselors um second shift we have
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
15 and um overnights we have 10 and on
 
01:31:24.590 --> 01:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
weekends we ensure the staff first and
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
second shift the awake shifts at 15
 
01:31:26.719 --> 01:31:27.629 align:start position:0%
second shift the awake shifts at 15
youth

01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
youth
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
counselors um we know that we'll always
 
01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
need the capacity to um spread youth um
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
to various units um for for many reasons
 
01:31:39.790 --> 01:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
uh we could have a youth needing a a
 
01:31:42.189 --> 01:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
period of Crisis stabilization uh we
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
certainly have new admissions coming in
 
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
um we could have a medical need to to
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
need to have youth be separated so we
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
need to make sure despite having perhaps
 
01:31:54.990 --> 01:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
12 to 18 youth that we have the staff
 
01:31:58.350 --> 01:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
available to spread um across the the
 
01:32:00.669 --> 01:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
various units as needed um we sometimes
 
01:32:02.590 --> 01:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
have court orders to keep youth um
 
01:32:05.669 --> 01:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
separated they could be um you know um
 
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
they could have the same charges uh they
 
01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
could have been brought in for similar
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
charges or the same charges in the same
 
01:32:13.229 --> 01:32:13.239 align:start position:0%
crime and so we need that capacity to be
 
01:32:15.709 --> 01:32:15.719 align:start position:0%
able to spread youth um ac across the
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:22.350 --> 01:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
needed representative Nano for a
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
question followed by representative
 
01:32:26.669 --> 01:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
Stringham yes thank you madam chair uh
 
01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
on uh page h64 uh budget Lines 102 103
 
01:32:35.070 --> 01:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
looks like a a fairly Hefty increase
 
01:32:37.229 --> 01:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
that another this this another case of
 
01:32:37.239 --> 01:32:38.149 align:start position:0%
that another this this another case of
money

01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
moving from someplace else or expenses
 
01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
moving from someplace else sure so one
 
01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
of the one of the things that we've had
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
to rely on is contracted agency staff
 
01:32:55.109 --> 01:32:55.119 align:start position:0%
and so you can see in the first state
 
01:32:56.189 --> 01:32:56.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
2024 what the actual expense is there um
 
01:33:02.430 --> 01:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
we've tried to account for that within
 
01:33:05.709 --> 01:33:05.719 align:start position:0%
the class 103 line this year so that we
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
can recognize those costs um there were
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
other increases as well just just while
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
we're on the topic I I can go through a
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
couple of those just so that they make a
 
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
little bit more sense um another uh
 
01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
fairly significant change is if you look
 
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
at instate travel
 
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
um you'll see in state fiscal year 24 it
 
01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:29.910 align:start position:0%
um you'll see in state fiscal year 24 it
was

01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
126,000 um and in the budget it was
 
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
$500 so so so we budgeted $500 but we
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
spent $67,000 sorry where am I looking
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh so so I'm looking I'm looking at the
 
01:33:46.189 --> 01:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
old budget right now for the $500 but
 
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
you would be looking at the instate
 
01:33:53.310 --> 01:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
travel line in class 70 so what what
 
01:33:55.109 --> 01:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
happened was there was a change within
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
the collective bargaining agreement
 
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
where if individuals are traveling um to
 
01:34:04.830 --> 01:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
cover an overtime shift that we pay
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
portal to portal miles for those
 
01:34:09.109 --> 01:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
individuals working at the Su use
 
01:34:11.470 --> 01:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
Services Center I believe it was also in
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 24 where we had to um
 
01:34:17.950 --> 01:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
where where this was extended to other
 
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
employees from the Department that were
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
coming to cover shifts where we didn't
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
have sufficient Staffing and and let
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
Marie talk about sort of the progress on
 
01:34:27.870 --> 01:34:27.880 align:start position:0%
the Staffing
 
01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
levels sure and you'll recall that was
 
01:34:31.870 --> 01:34:31.880 align:start position:0%
one of the highlights was the the
 
01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
decrease in vacancies for the youth
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
counselor position um so we've got 46
 
01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
full-time youth counselors um in total
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you uh just a few years
 
01:34:44.590 --> 01:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
back we had seven of those filled um
 
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
remember trying to contemplate how we're
 
01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
going to staff the facility with seven
 
01:34:51.550 --> 01:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
people um and so now our our our vacancy
 
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
um is down we have six vacant positions
 
01:34:56.350 --> 01:34:56.360 align:start position:0%
right now at syc um and so we've made
 
01:34:58.510 --> 01:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
significant significant progress but
 
01:35:01.109 --> 01:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
certainly we were required to uh pay
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
overtime for other people in the in the
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
department um in dcyf to come fill
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
shifts at syc and the collective
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement um called for pay
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
for them for their travel um and of
 
01:35:14.669 --> 01:35:14.679 align:start position:0%
course their overtime um was significant
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
as well so we've we've made significant
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
progress in that area so just a a quick
 
01:35:24.189 --> 01:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
followup so line line 103
 
01:35:27.310 --> 01:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
um what EXA you know just helped me
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
understand operation Services covers
 
01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:32.360 align:start position:0%
what and then there's a Frey you know
 
01:35:34.990 --> 01:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
again a significant jump up in the in
 
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
the um expenses double I guess
 
01:35:45.390 --> 01:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
uh sure so the the Staffing contract was
 
01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
budgeted at 1.3
 
01:35:52.350 --> 01:35:52.360 align:start position:0%
million uh tutoring was approximately uh
 
01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.709 align:start position:0%
million uh tutoring was approximately uh
300,000

01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
300,000
 
01:35:57.149 --> 01:35:57.159 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe that was budgeted
 
01:35:57.159 --> 01:35:58.109 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe that was budgeted
there

01:35:58.109 --> 01:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
before and I can I can get additional
 
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
details on the other contracts are are
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
included in that line I don't recall
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
them off the top of my head just looks
 
01:36:10.109 --> 01:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
like a pretty significant jump up
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
yep representative Stringham followed by
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative walner for
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
questions uh yeah thanks we're we're
 
01:36:19.709 --> 01:36:19.719 align:start position:0%
still looking at a an in um 103 a
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
population of about average of about 12
 
01:36:26.830 --> 01:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
right yes 12 to 18 with the goal of 12
 
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
and and are you anticipating a asking
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
for additional money in
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
2025 uh or is the 12.7 million likely
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
going to be adequate to get us to June
 
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
30th to start with um we're projecting
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the vicinity of $15 million
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
of expenses in the current
 
01:36:52.030 --> 01:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
banum in the second year of the banum or
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
in in in in state FIS year 25 thank you
 
01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:56.669 align:start position:0%
in in in in state FIS year 25 thank you
and

01:36:56.669 --> 01:36:56.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:00.030 --> 01:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
um I I'm you know just speaking broadly
 
01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:00.790 align:start position:0%
um I I'm you know just speaking broadly
this

01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:37:04.030 --> 01:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
is um support services for 12 children
 
01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's enough for 500 children who are
 
01:37:10.109 --> 01:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
uh just to pay for the school system
 
01:37:12.189 --> 01:37:12.199 align:start position:0%
including a quarter of that being
 
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
special needs support so um it it is um
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
a tremendous um uh investment that that
 
01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
we're making in these kids and I am
 
01:37:26.709 --> 01:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
concerned with the uh the rate of growth
 
01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
uh in this uh in these numbers and I'm
 
01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you if are there any
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
other um uh ideas or um things you have
 
01:37:41.550 --> 01:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
in mind um uh to bring these numbers
 
01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
down or to bring down the uh contract or
 
01:37:48.109 --> 01:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
overtime Services numbers down more than
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh than you have so
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
farh so we are implementing a trauma
 
01:37:56.709 --> 01:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
informed model called Target um that
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
will roll out um the all our clinicians
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
are all trained our millu staff will
 
01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
also be trained so that we're hoping to
 
01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
um have youth uh and staff focus on the
 
01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
trauma reactive symptoms and behaviors
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing of these youth um so
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
that is one idea that we hope will um
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
bring some stability and will also help
 
01:38:20.669 --> 01:38:20.679 align:start position:0%
with um recidivism once kids launch from
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
the from the facility but I did talk
 
01:38:25.390 --> 01:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
already about that multi- disciplinary
 
01:38:26.830 --> 01:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
group that's coming together to think
 
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
about alternatives to syc more
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
specifically with the detained youth um
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
but I do have to tell you that the youth
 
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
that are coming to syc are coming um
 
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
often with very very violent behaviors
 
01:38:43.589 --> 01:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
um assaultive behaviors um harming
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
others um other other youth their family
 
01:38:50.189 --> 01:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
members um and so you know this is the
 
01:38:52.990 --> 01:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
deepest deepest end of our system um and
 
01:38:55.390 --> 01:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
so while we hope that the system of care
 
01:38:57.709 --> 01:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
and all of the um outside of the agency
 
01:39:00.270 --> 01:39:00.280 align:start position:0%
work might help to catch some of these
 
01:39:02.669 --> 01:39:02.679 align:start position:0%
families uh we recognize that we will
 
01:39:05.870 --> 01:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
have a need for a right siiz center we
 
01:39:09.070 --> 01:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
know it's not 144 beds as it is now um
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
so we're we're again looking at that 12
 
01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
um and sometimes we're up to 18 with
 
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
with some ability to divert we are
 
01:39:17.790 --> 01:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
diverting lots of kids with our
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
diversion program and our JJ assessment
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
from stepping into that uh even
 
01:39:24.589 --> 01:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
tiptoeing into the deeper part of our
 
01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
system right once kids get into the
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
system sometimes behaviors exacerbate
 
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
and then they keep going deeper and
 
01:39:32.109 --> 01:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
deeper so uh we've been able to stop
 
01:39:34.229 --> 01:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
there but we do recognize that the youth
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
coming to the center's attention
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
currently um are coming with some pretty
 
01:39:40.109 --> 01:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
significant behavioral
 
01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
challenges thank you if if we could jump
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
to um uh 31 which which deals with this
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
new new uh use Center um it talks about
 
01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's labeled H hb2 budget area
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
for consideration uh one thing was uh uh
 
01:39:56.639 --> 01:39:57.510 align:start position:0%
for consideration uh one thing was uh uh
this

01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
legislature um uh authorized purchase of
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
a body scanner is that something that
 
01:40:05.709 --> 01:40:05.719 align:start position:0%
happened or did not happen and any
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
comment on the on the 1 million um
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
budget cut that's also listed in
 
01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
there so the body scanner has been
 
01:40:16.030 --> 01:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
purchased so we do have it on site at
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
the facility so what we're currently
 
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
working through um is ensuring we have
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
the right policies and operating
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
procedures for parental consent youth
 
01:40:27.229 --> 01:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
consent um how males females might
 
01:40:29.470 --> 01:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
differ um regarding their ability to go
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
through a scanning system what we would
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
do if if if kids do not consent if
 
01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
parents do not consent so we're in the
 
01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
process of creating a policy but we do
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
have the scanner on site but sounds like
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
it's not being used yet it's not being
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
used yet thank
 
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
walner thank you in previous budgets we
 
01:40:52.750 --> 01:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
always had in theu new Youth Services
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
Center we always had a lot of um
 
01:40:56.830 --> 01:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
positions for
 
01:40:59.709 --> 01:40:59.719 align:start position:0%
Education where how are we doing the
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
education now for these
 
01:41:05.589 --> 01:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
kids the education is currently a
 
01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:09.320 align:start position:0%
contract um I think that is class line
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
74 currently in accounting unit
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
6643 um and we do have a a contractor
 
01:41:18.589 --> 01:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
providing a tutoring model to our youth
 
01:41:20.709 --> 01:41:20.719 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a program that connects with
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
the child's School District so the the
 
01:41:25.870 --> 01:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
child use to receive the educational um
 
01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
Services of their individual School uh
 
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
District through a tutoring model at the
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
facility and and and and just to clarify
 
01:41:35.310 --> 01:41:35.320 align:start position:0%
currently it's in class 74 it's being
 
01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
moved to to the class 103 and that's
 
01:41:41.709 --> 01:41:41.719 align:start position:0%
$300,000 annually oh okay thank you I
 
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
wondered about that so when this is sort
 
01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
of looking out into the future but when
 
01:41:50.189 --> 01:41:50.199 align:start position:0%
we move to the new
 
01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
facility do what do you think think the
 
01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
budget will look like I mean are you
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
anticipating that the budget will be
 
01:42:03.589 --> 01:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
same Nathan may want to clarify some of
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
my responses but we know and we
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
anticipate that there is going to be
 
01:42:13.229 --> 01:42:13.239 align:start position:0%
some capacity for shared services um on
 
01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
the Hamstead campus with Hamstead
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
hospital um as we all know there's been
 
01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
a new contract and Dartmouth is
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
currently overseeing um the Hamstead
 
01:42:24.910 --> 01:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
Hospital part of the of the campus and
 
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
so we are needing to work through what
 
01:42:28.990 --> 01:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
those shared services will be we have
 
01:42:31.149 --> 01:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
some ideas we need to regroup with the
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
new leadership at Hamstead hospital so
 
01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
we anticipate being able to see some
 
01:42:37.229 --> 01:42:37.239 align:start position:0%
cost savings but we have not been able
 
01:42:39.149 --> 01:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
to identify what those are yet until we
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
can work that out with with the new
 
01:42:47.070 --> 01:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
contractor do you anticipate any um
 
01:42:50.189 --> 01:42:50.199 align:start position:0%
Staffing reductions that that it would
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
cost less in the new facility
 
01:42:54.669 --> 01:42:54.679 align:start position:0%
I think that that's possible it would
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
not be youth counselor so youth
 
01:42:57.669 --> 01:42:57.679 align:start position:0%
counselor staff would need to be
 
01:42:59.470 --> 01:42:59.480 align:start position:0%
consistent um because we would not be
 
01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
sharing right there there separate
 
01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
facilities on a shared campus so we
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
would not be sharing our youth counselor
 
01:43:07.950 --> 01:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
staff but perhaps kitchen staff or
 
01:43:10.229 --> 01:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
maintenance staff um there's also the
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
contemplation that perhaps um for
 
01:43:16.030 --> 01:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
example a new um you know a larger
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
kitchen or a larger laundry area is
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
needed so we might need more staff
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
because of that because we're combining
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
efforts so we're it's possible that we
 
01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
could see some staffing shifts and and
 
01:43:27.790 --> 01:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
it's just unknown
 
01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
yet and and and just just to add a
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of background um so the the
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
department um had brought forward an
 
01:43:39.189 --> 01:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
item to GNC to lease Hamstead Hospital
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment Facility to
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth and there were there were four
 
01:43:45.310 --> 01:43:45.320 align:start position:0%
separate agreement types within that
 
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
sort of larger package and and one of
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
those was a was a transition Services
 
01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
agreement where basically the state
 
01:43:55.870 --> 01:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
would continue continue to provide um or
 
01:43:58.390 --> 01:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
provide for the contracted services that
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
the state was receiving and then
 
01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth reimburses us for those costs
 
01:44:05.070 --> 01:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
plus a small admin cost so we're we're
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
still working out for I just want to
 
01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
provide this for context we're still
 
01:44:11.070 --> 01:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
working with Dartmouth and they're still
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
making their long-term strategic
 
01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
decisions on which of those contracts
 
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to keep what they're going
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
to absorb whether they're going to go
 
01:44:20.830 --> 01:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
out to Bid And so they're working on
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
that transition component which is why
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
we don't yet have an answer for what the
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
shared services will look like until
 
01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
they kind of make their own operational
 
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
decisions so that we can evaluate what
 
01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
can be shared at that point in time okay
 
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
and one more question I have is around
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
medical payments to Providers do we have
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
nurses on staff 24 hours a day yes we do
 
01:44:48.910 --> 01:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
so we have a nurse for every shift we do
 
01:44:51.030 --> 01:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
have nursing on staff and so these these
 
01:44:53.589 --> 01:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
payments are to providers
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
um that you have to take the children to
 
01:44:58.750 --> 01:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
the doctor or correct it could be Labs
 
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
um clinical Labs drawn needed um maybe
 
01:45:03.790 --> 01:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
x-rays if an x-ray needed to happen for
 
01:45:05.709 --> 01:45:05.719 align:start position:0%
a youth for some reason but yes so it
 
01:45:07.709 --> 01:45:07.719 align:start position:0%
would be those kinds of offsite things
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
we also have a contract um for a
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
hygienist and a dentist who come on site
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide that kind of care
 
01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
right in the facility so that's also
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
included here okay and how many nurses
 
01:45:21.629 --> 01:45:21.639 align:start position:0%
do we have on
 
01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
staff I don't I don't know that number
 
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
exactly I can get that for you all right
 
01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:26.950 align:start position:0%
exactly I can get that for you all right
thank

01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
you representative tersi followed by
 
01:45:33.629 --> 01:45:33.639 align:start position:0%
representative Nano thank you I um when
 
01:45:36.270 --> 01:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
we talk about this group of children
 
01:45:39.149 --> 01:45:39.159 align:start position:0%
with such high extreme needs um it
 
01:45:41.950 --> 01:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
brought to mind the conversation around
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
out of state placements is that going to
 
01:45:47.149 --> 01:45:47.159 align:start position:0%
come or is that embedded in this group
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
of children in the budget that's not the
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
right way to communicate that
 
01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
but so our res presidential treatment as
 
01:45:55.629 --> 01:45:55.639 align:start position:0%
we discuss in field services includes
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
the instate and out of state okay so we
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
already went past that all right but I'm
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that you
 
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
have I guess I sort of missed my
 
01:46:07.709 --> 01:46:07.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at the numbers um
 
01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
just quickly how many children do you
 
01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
have out of state right now we have
 
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
about um I would say close to 60
 
01:46:18.189 --> 01:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
children out of state um 6 z um but 50
 
01:46:19.950 --> 01:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
of those would be in the New England
 
01:46:23.189 --> 01:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
area um with about eight um out of of
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
what we call out of region so out of New
 
01:46:27.709 --> 01:46:27.719 align:start position:0%
England okay and
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
um your site visits and um check-ins has
 
01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
that changed at all or um budget wise
 
01:46:38.589 --> 01:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
did you account for any of those changes
 
01:46:39.870 --> 01:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
you might have
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
needed yes so um Senate Bill 417 um
 
01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:46.719 align:start position:0%
provided significant changes um to the
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
the work that DCF does with our our
 
01:46:52.030 --> 01:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
monthly visits and our um preference for
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
how we place children ensuring the least
 
01:46:57.070 --> 01:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
restrictive um setting possible first um
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
so we do have prioritized need um okay
 
01:47:01.550 --> 01:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to pass that to Nathan to talk
 
01:47:05.070 --> 01:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
about for 417 sure so we we we had a
 
01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
couple of prioritized needs um SP 417
 
01:47:13.189 --> 01:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
created um a total of 10 positions eight
 
01:47:16.589 --> 01:47:16.599 align:start position:0%
cpsws and two jpos to address those
 
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
needs as well as travel dollars um we do
 
01:47:21.629 --> 01:47:21.639 align:start position:0%
have some of the travel money that was
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
added during the governor's phase um the
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
positions were not um explicitly funded
 
01:47:30.990 --> 01:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
wi within within the accounting units
 
01:47:35.830 --> 01:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
process thank
 
01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
you I thank you madam chair this is a
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
kind of a general question and you know
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
partly a demographics uh type question
 
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
what impact if any and uh what on on
 
01:47:55.390 --> 01:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
your on the clientele uh is related to
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
um Refugee families or immigrant
 
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
families is that part in parcel of and
 
01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:09.990 --> 01:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
that so we don't have data specific to
 
01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
the refugee population but certainly We
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
Serve All Families that come to our
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
attention um I know we've gotten some
 
01:48:18.589 --> 01:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
questions recently with some of the uh
 
01:48:20.350 --> 01:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
Federal changes whether we're seeing any
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
kind of increase um in in that
 
01:48:24.750 --> 01:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
population of family and we're we're not
 
01:48:27.550 --> 01:48:27.560 align:start position:0%
we're not seeing any any new information
 
01:48:29.310 --> 01:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
or new families coming to our attention
 
01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
at this time as a result of any federal
 
01:48:34.750 --> 01:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
changes okay thank you representative
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
priest for a
 
01:48:39.589 --> 01:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
question yes uh M chairman um thank you
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um the settlement
 
01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
that is going on now with the children
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
that have been housed in the senuna
 
01:48:55.229 --> 01:48:55.239 align:start position:0%
youth service is there a line item of
 
01:48:59.310 --> 01:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
potential settlement fees or how how are
 
01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
you handling it so that that's handled
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Justice I I I
 
01:49:07.030 --> 01:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
believe in in Prior legislative session
 
01:49:08.910 --> 01:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
a trust fund was established I think at
 
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
the time $100 million was put into there
 
01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
and and that's administered um Again by
 
01:49:16.430 --> 01:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Justice DHHS is not
 
01:49:18.070 --> 01:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
involved in the distribution of those
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
funds nor do we oversee
 
01:49:22.990 --> 01:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
them okay thank you
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
one thing I wanted to say additionally
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
for um regarding the children place out
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
of out of state and specifically in the
 
01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
New England uh region is that we often U
 
01:49:36.350 --> 01:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
find that some of the bordering um towns
 
01:49:38.669 --> 01:49:38.679 align:start position:0%
um actually have programs that are in
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
closer proximity to the family homes
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
than a northern uh program say for a
 
01:49:46.109 --> 01:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
keen or a Nashua family so I just did
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
want to make that distinction and that's
 
01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
why we monitor closely um New England
 
01:49:53.470 --> 01:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
versus outof region placements um and
 
01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
representative wner to answer your
 
01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
question um to the number of nurses at
 
01:49:59.229 --> 01:49:59.239 align:start position:0%
the syc there's seven
 
01:50:01.270 --> 01:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
nurses thank
 
01:50:04.589 --> 01:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
you representative priest for a question
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and thank you
 
01:50:10.430 --> 01:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question again um on the
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
total number of positions um are these
 
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
employees that are being moved to I mean
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
it's an increase of 10 new positions on
 
01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
page uh
 
01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:27.750 align:start position:0%
page uh
865

01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
865
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
um down toward the end so so th those
 
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
are the 10 positions I referred to
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
earlier they were established but when
 
01:50:38.830 --> 01:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
we look globally at at the funding I I
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
believe those are not funded
 
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
sufficiently so that's the the s417
 
01:50:47.669 --> 01:50:47.679 align:start position:0%
positions that were created that's the
 
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
eight cpsws and two
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
jpos sorry uh child protective service
 
01:51:00.430 --> 01:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:04.589 --> 01:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
you I'm moving to slide 22 and in slide
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
22 shows um the trend line and this is
 
01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
over a significant period of time since
 
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
2020 to 2024 to just show um the
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
significant decrease in the census at
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
syc over time um you know from from this
 
01:51:23.069 --> 01:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
144 bed facility down towards um 12 18
 
01:51:29.790 --> 01:51:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:32.709 --> 01:51:32.719 align:start position:0%
currently I'm moving to slide 23 and
 
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
this is the office of the director this
 
01:51:37.069 --> 01:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
is um back to the beginning of of the of
 
01:51:42.589 --> 01:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
848 and in in this budget um we're
 
01:51:47.790 --> 01:51:47.800 align:start position:0%
seeing the director and deputy director
 
01:51:50.069 --> 01:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
our constituent relations program which
 
01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%

01:51:56.069 --> 01:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
team of employees um who can manage

moved to other accounting units um so
 
01:52:28.990 --> 01:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
that's where you might see a decrease in
 
01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:35.990 align:start position:0%
that's where you might see a decrease in
the

01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%

01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
sub by substances and we also have our
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
community Navigator contract that I
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
referenced at Central intake to um
 
01:53:32.830 --> 01:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
support families and people concerned
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
about families uh with with um pointing
 
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
them in the right direction outside of
 
01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
the agency when
 
01:53:39.199 --> 01:53:41.149 align:start position:0%
the agency when
possible

01:53:41.149 --> 01:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:53:44.910 --> 01:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
um in accounting unit 2297 which is on
 
01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:48.069 align:start position:0%
um in accounting unit 2297 which is on
page

01:53:48.069 --> 01:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.310 --> 01:53:51.320 align:start position:0%
854 just just a very quick just a very
 
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
quick question on um the contracts for
 
01:53:58.910 --> 01:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh program services for fiscal year 2025
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
are we running pretty much uh according
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:10.149 --> 01:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
below so so there's two contracts there
 
01:54:12.109 --> 01:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
the the ladak contract and the community
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
Navigator contract um I I I would have
 
01:54:18.109 --> 01:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
to go back to the invoicing detail and
 
01:54:19.629 --> 01:54:19.639 align:start position:0%
statement of Appropriations to
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
understand where we're at these these
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
are 100%
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
um federal funds it's a Child Abuse
 
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
Prevention and treatment act so so
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
they're designated for specific purposes
 
01:54:32.830 --> 01:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
and specific uses but but I'd have to go
 
01:54:35.629 --> 01:54:35.639 align:start position:0%
back and and see where we're at today
 
01:54:38.669 --> 01:54:38.679 align:start position:0%
and and and recognizing that I'm I'm
 
01:54:39.990 --> 01:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
pretty certain these are cost
 
01:54:42.430 --> 01:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and we often will see
 
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
delays in the invoicing that we receive
 
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
in excess of a month or two months or 3
 
01:54:51.629 --> 01:54:51.639 align:start position:0%
months so um a point in time today may
 
01:54:53.669 --> 01:54:53.679 align:start position:0%
not show you the full picture of what
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
the state fiscal year expenditure need
 
01:54:58.430 --> 01:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
represents so the state lays out the
 
01:55:00.589 --> 01:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
money and then later gets reimbursed for
 
01:55:06.669 --> 01:55:06.679 align:start position:0%
it uh no so so the opposite so um by
 
01:55:08.830 --> 01:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
default many of our contracts are are
 
01:55:12.069 --> 01:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
cost reimbursement in the sense that the
 
01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
um provider the vendor the contractor
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
they incur a cost and they submitted
 
01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
invoice with detailed uh expenses and
 
01:55:22.350 --> 01:55:22.360 align:start position:0%
supporting documentation we review it
 
01:55:24.030 --> 01:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
and then once we make a determination
 
01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
that the services were provided and and
 
01:55:28.629 --> 01:55:28.639 align:start position:0%
or allowable then we go ahead and make
 
01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
the payment okay so just a
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of which way the
 
01:55:34.149 --> 01:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
reimbursement was working yes we we do
 
01:55:39.069 --> 01:55:39.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
you moving to accounting unit 2297 which
 
01:55:45.790 --> 01:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
is on page 854 of the governor's budget
 
01:55:48.830 --> 01:55:48.840 align:start position:0%

successful representative Nano for a
 
02:01:35.310 --> 02:01:35.320 align:start position:0%
question again this is probably the same
 
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
kind of a question they're all zeros in
 
02:01:38.669 --> 02:01:38.679 align:start position:0%
here when I'm looking at the governor's
 
02:01:40.589 --> 02:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
uh budget and this is something that has
 
02:01:43.629 --> 02:01:43.639 align:start position:0%
shifted from someplace else I guess yeah
 
02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
so so we we moved funds um that that we
 
02:01:48.149 --> 02:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
the positions and the funding that we
 
02:01:49.550 --> 02:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
were referring to earlier so there's
 
02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
four separate accounts 2956 2 957 2973
 
02:01:57.990 --> 02:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
and 2961 from which these dollars came
 
02:01:59.470 --> 02:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
we we can do something similar and
 
02:02:01.229 --> 02:02:01.239 align:start position:0%
provide a crosswalk so it's clear to the
 
02:02:03.030 --> 02:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
committee sort of how the dollars moved
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
around yeah that that would I mean
 
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
definitely help uh sure help get my head
 
02:02:12.669 --> 02:02:12.679 align:start position:0%
around the numbers absolutely thank you
 
02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth for a question
 
02:02:18.069 --> 02:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um could you give a
 
02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
a quick summary so this is close to 5050
 
02:02:24.990 --> 02:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
with the Federal Federal funding how is
 
02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
the federal funding determined in this
 
02:02:35.149 --> 02:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
category so the the Personnel um would
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
likely be cost allocated um it would be
 
02:02:40.510 --> 02:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
in in in this case I'm assuming many of
 
02:02:42.510 --> 02:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
these individuals be uh either
 
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
conducting a random moment study or
 
02:02:48.510 --> 02:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
random Time study to uh document how
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
their time is spent and uh most likely
 
02:02:54.350 --> 02:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
it would be fore eligible and and so
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
that's kind of uh I think early on we
 
02:02:57.390 --> 02:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about cost
 
02:02:59.390 --> 02:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
allocation and it's kind of a our budget
 
02:03:00.750 --> 02:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
is a Point of Departure we make
 
02:03:02.430 --> 02:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
assumptions around what we would expect
 
02:03:04.750 --> 02:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
so most of the time there we' expect
 
02:03:07.470 --> 02:03:07.480 align:start position:0%
50/50 um depending upon the nature of
 
02:03:10.990 --> 02:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
any unique contracts that might change
 
02:03:12.830 --> 02:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
um which is why you wouldn't necessarily
 
02:03:16.750 --> 02:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
see a 5050 split across all funds
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
because it would the the cost would need
 
02:03:33.390 --> 02:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.470 --> 02:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
moving to slide
 
02:03:38.229 --> 02:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
26 uh this is a new Bureau professional
 
02:03:40.589 --> 02:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
and strategic development and we're
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
looking at accounting unit 3220 on page
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
857 of the governor's
 
02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
budget and so in this accounting unit um
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
we're seeing our our employee training
 
02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
contract uh sits here and so we do have
 
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
a robust training model for our new
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
staff um we call it Core Academy um it
 
02:04:03.310 --> 02:04:03.320 align:start position:0%
trains our child protective workers our
 
02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
jpos our jenal probation and pearl
 
02:04:08.229 --> 02:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
officers um and our youth counselors um
 
02:04:11.669 --> 02:04:11.679 align:start position:0%
it's about an 8-week program um taking
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
probably uh closer to three months uh
 
02:04:16.510 --> 02:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
because of some time off to to do some
 
02:04:18.510 --> 02:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
work back at their office shadowing
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
other employees um it's also training
 
02:04:23.910 --> 02:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
for for uh it provides ongoing training
 
02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
beyond the core training it also
 
02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
provides um training for our Residential
 
02:04:30.549 --> 02:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
Treatment providers and our caregivers
 
02:04:33.189 --> 02:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
so it it provides um all all of our
 
02:04:33.199 --> 02:04:35.189 align:start position:0%
so it it provides um all all of our
training

02:04:35.189 --> 02:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
training
 
02:04:35.199 --> 02:04:36.790 align:start position:0%
training
needs

02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
needs
 
02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
um a very quick question could you could
 
02:04:42.910 --> 02:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
you kind of roughly characterize uh what
 
02:04:46.189 --> 02:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
kinds of training absolutely yes so um
 
02:04:48.149 --> 02:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
for our child protective service workers
 
02:04:50.030 --> 02:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
um the investigative training there are
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
certain tracks there's some training
 
02:04:54.109 --> 02:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
that are you um Carry forward to all of
 
02:04:55.669 --> 02:04:55.679 align:start position:0%
our client facing position and then
 
02:04:57.629 --> 02:04:57.639 align:start position:0%
there's certain tracks so for our
 
02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
investigators there would be um
 
02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
trainings around
 
02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
interviewing um engaging with families
 
02:05:05.950 --> 02:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
and making sure that we have the ability
 
02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
to sit and partner with families and
 
02:05:08.910 --> 02:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
listen to them and understand their
 
02:05:11.229 --> 02:05:11.239 align:start position:0%
needs um that would be a training that
 
02:05:13.470 --> 02:05:13.480 align:start position:0%
would be unique across all of them uh
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
for our youth counselors um they'd
 
02:05:17.390 --> 02:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
receive um special training on being in
 
02:05:19.830 --> 02:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
the milu on their units um how to
 
02:05:22.990 --> 02:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
deescalate um a youth whose um you know
 
02:05:25.629 --> 02:05:25.639 align:start position:0%
symptoms may be um exacerbated and and
 
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
may be having some challenging behaviors
 
02:05:30.430 --> 02:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
uh for our family service our ongoing
 
02:05:32.709 --> 02:05:32.719 align:start position:0%
case workers in child protection they
 
02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
would have specific training around case
 
02:05:37.870 --> 02:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
planning with children um all of the
 
02:05:40.830 --> 02:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
areas have training unique to the legal
 
02:05:42.990 --> 02:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
aspects of their jobs what to expect in
 
02:05:45.390 --> 02:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
court um how they might write particular
 
02:05:47.950 --> 02:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
reports or or information so we'll have
 
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
different uh trainers come in with the
 
02:05:51.709 --> 02:05:51.719 align:start position:0%
specialty in those particular areas in
 
02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
order to enhance our staff um initial
 
02:05:58.229 --> 02:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
education thank you for that thank
 
02:06:01.709 --> 02:06:01.719 align:start position:0%
you representative priest for a question
 
02:06:03.149 --> 02:06:03.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Madame chairman and thank you
 
02:06:05.629 --> 02:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
for taking my question again as a
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
clarification uh this new align item
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
3220 is supposed to take care of all the
 
02:06:18.109 --> 02:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
training needs for this division is that
 
02:06:21.069 --> 02:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
correct there was um a reference to the
 
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
a training contract in a prior um in the
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
kinship as well but yes the bulk of our
 
02:06:28.229 --> 02:06:28.239 align:start position:0%
our training happens here okay good
 
02:06:28.239 --> 02:06:37.549 align:start position:0%
our training happens here okay good
thank

02:06:37.549 --> 02:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
you uh we also have some contracts in
 
02:06:43.030 --> 02:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit um we have a a
 
02:06:44.830 --> 02:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
contract for a program that we call risk
 
02:06:47.390 --> 02:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
and safety consultation um which is
 
02:06:50.990 --> 02:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
meant to um be a quality assurance
 
02:06:55.549 --> 02:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
control over our most intensive
 
02:06:59.350 --> 02:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
investigations um so those that require
 
02:07:02.310 --> 02:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
um the most care the most investigative
 
02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
processes to ensure that we have a group
 
02:07:07.629 --> 02:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
of Staff um also reviewing we it's a
 
02:07:09.870 --> 02:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
very small team but we have a small team
 
02:07:12.750 --> 02:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
reviewing alongside um our district
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
offices to ensure that nothing safety
 
02:07:17.310 --> 02:07:17.320 align:start position:0%
related is overlooked so it's a coaching
 
02:07:19.149 --> 02:07:19.159 align:start position:0%
mod model and a quality improvement
 
02:07:21.549 --> 02:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
model so you'll see that contract um
 
02:07:25.750 --> 02:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
sits in here um we also do have
 
02:07:29.069 --> 02:07:29.079 align:start position:0%
um our can's contract sits here as well
 
02:07:30.549 --> 02:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
which is our Child and Adolescent needs
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
and strengths tool that our Juvenile
 
02:07:34.910 --> 02:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
Justice assessment team is using um to
 
02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
assess uh the needs and and strengths of
 
02:07:39.950 --> 02:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
Youth to be able to then ensure we can
 
02:07:41.109 --> 02:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
meet those needs we're going to be
 
02:07:42.990 --> 02:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
carrying that over to a child protective
 
02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
staff as well so those that those
 
02:07:48.910 --> 02:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:51.990 --> 02:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
here in addition to training um in in
 
02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
this unit we um as I mentioned we have
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
the risk and safety consultation that
 
02:07:59.069 --> 02:07:59.079 align:start position:0%
those coaches uh for our investigators
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
we also have um implementation science
 
02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
staff who are focused on um delivering
 
02:08:05.430 --> 02:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
special projects our strategic
 
02:08:08.109 --> 02:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
priorities for example monitoring uh
 
02:08:09.709 --> 02:08:09.719 align:start position:0%
reviewing the data that comes out of
 
02:08:11.149 --> 02:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
that making sure that we're staying on
 
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:22.109 --> 02:08:22.119 align:start position:0%
Bureau moving to slide 27 on page 8
 
02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
58 this is accounting unit 3221 this is
 
02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
our Bureau of evaluation analytics and
 
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
Reporting this is a small team um that
 
02:08:34.430 --> 02:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
comprises the dcyf data analytics um
 
02:08:36.310 --> 02:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
Team our quality assurance and
 
02:08:43.390 --> 02:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:46.549 --> 02:08:46.559 align:start position:0%
reporting so in class line
 
02:08:51.470 --> 02:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
um 26 I I I wanted to point out um this
 
02:08:55.470 --> 02:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
this is our um a data analytics um
 
02:08:59.669 --> 02:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
service that um scours the dcyf data
 
02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
each day so every single morning we can
 
02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
come in and be able to re review a
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
dashboard our case workers can look at
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
things uh regarding their casework uh
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
which clients might need to be seen um
 
02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
any number of data points regarding
 
02:09:14.549 --> 02:09:14.559 align:start position:0%
permanency and out of home care and
 
02:09:16.990 --> 02:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
face-to-face contact UM with with
 
02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
children and families so it provides um
 
02:09:22.069 --> 02:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
a a dashboard of avail able um
 
02:09:23.910 --> 02:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
information that helps not only field
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
workers but all levels of the agency
 
02:09:27.709 --> 02:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
monitor practice and and see where we
 
02:09:40.910 --> 02:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:51.510 --> 02:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
860 this is a new accounting unit um so
 
02:09:54.430 --> 02:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
many of these staff were originally in
 
02:09:56.390 --> 02:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
that if you remember there were 35 Staff
 
02:09:59.910 --> 02:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
in the director's office um previously
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
um so this is a a new accounting unit
 
02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
which is comprised of our general
 
02:10:07.069 --> 02:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
Council um which includes our policy
 
02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
inform form development and our child
 
02:10:11.149 --> 02:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect central registry as
 
02:10:13.950 --> 02:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
well as our business Information Systems
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
um group of Staff which um over SI case
 
02:10:19.069 --> 02:10:19.079 align:start position:0%
management system our our Legacy system
 
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
that we currently have as well as will
 
02:10:23.669 --> 02:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
um focus on the the build um and roll
 
02:10:25.189 --> 02:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
out of our new electronic case
 
02:10:30.310 --> 02:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:32.950 --> 02:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
support this is and I'm sorry I think I
 
02:10:34.109 --> 02:10:34.119 align:start position:0%
failed to mention this is accounting
 
02:10:37.629 --> 02:10:37.639 align:start position:0%
unit 3444 on page
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
860 and there's a few contracts um
 
02:10:43.390 --> 02:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
overseen here um in the um Information
 
02:10:48.350 --> 02:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
Systems group um in particular our syc
 
02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
case management system bizstream um is
 
02:10:55.189 --> 02:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
this contract sits here um as does a
 
02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
couple other contracts uh we're
 
02:10:59.629 --> 02:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
developing a contract for video storage
 
02:11:03.030 --> 02:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
and viewing um so kids who have
 
02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
experienced um um significant uh neglect
 
02:11:11.189 --> 02:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
and abuse often um receive their initial
 
02:11:13.549 --> 02:11:13.559 align:start position:0%
um child interview at a Child Advocacy
 
02:11:15.549 --> 02:11:15.559 align:start position:0%
Center uh when a crime could have been
 
02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
committed um where there's forensically
 
02:11:20.030 --> 02:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh trained interviewers and law
 
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement um perhaps county attorney's
 
02:11:25.790 --> 02:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
office um dcyf staff can all uh
 
02:11:28.069 --> 02:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
participate in the child interview um at
 
02:11:31.030 --> 02:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
the same time to minimize Reliance on um
 
02:11:33.470 --> 02:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
or uh minimize dup duplicative
 
02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
interviews of of a child victim and so
 
02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
those interviews are videotaped and and
 
02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
we're needing to ensure that we have uh
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
storage that we have um the software
 
02:11:45.470 --> 02:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
available to view um those interviews
 
02:11:47.229 --> 02:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
that are coming to us through the job
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
advocacy centers um and so we have a
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
contract here to ensure that that we
 
02:11:54.270 --> 02:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
don't lose that important um evidence as
 
02:11:56.669 --> 02:11:56.679 align:start position:0%
we're trying to protect children um so
 
02:11:58.750 --> 02:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
those are a couple of the contracts um
 
02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:09.549 --> 02:12:09.559 align:start position:0%
unit moving to slide
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
29 um we did talk um a bit about this
 
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
already this is um the cable uh 463 and
 
02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:21.310 align:start position:0%
already this is um the cable uh 463 and
417

02:12:21.310 --> 02:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh 4117 is the oversight of Residential
 
02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
Treatment um which impacts enhanced
 
02:12:29.629 --> 02:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
oversight um by our child protective
 
02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
service workers um and the courts and um
 
02:12:34.990 --> 02:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
outlines the order of preference of how
 
02:12:37.390 --> 02:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
children's uh placement is
 
02:12:40.669 --> 02:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
contemplated um Senate Bill
 
02:12:46.069 --> 02:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
463 um is a new bill that would um
 
02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
require that children in residential
 
02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
treatment um will have court appointed
 
02:12:53.790 --> 02:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
Council um that will represent their
 
02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
expressed interest um again for any
 
02:12:58.350 --> 02:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
child in residential treatment and that
 
02:13:00.270 --> 02:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
could be expanded to any other child
 
02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
interested in in in that representation
 
02:13:04.350 --> 02:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
and and our field staff will be
 
02:13:06.189 --> 02:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
informing the children of their right
 
02:13:09.229 --> 02:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
notifying Court um and and that will
 
02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
have a phased in approach
 
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
um but that was um defrayed by in the
 
02:13:18.750 --> 02:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
governor's budget representative walner
 
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
for a
 
02:13:22.229 --> 02:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
question you
 
02:13:26.109 --> 02:13:26.119 align:start position:0%
you so Senate Bill 463 spent a lot of
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
time in this committee last
 
02:13:28.159 --> 02:13:29.950 align:start position:0%
time in this committee last
year

02:13:29.950 --> 02:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:13:33.990 --> 02:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:35.950 align:start position:0%
 
me

02:13:35.950 --> 02:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:13:39.629 --> 02:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
what on these lines the
 
02:13:43.109 --> 02:13:43.119 align:start position:0%
um I I guess you have it on two pages
 
02:13:45.470 --> 02:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
right it's both
 
02:13:50.109 --> 02:13:50.119 align:start position:0%
on page 29 and then again on page 30
 
02:13:51.950 --> 02:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative wner it it looks like
 
02:13:54.549 --> 02:13:54.559 align:start position:0%
there was a printing er error um I I
 
02:13:57.910 --> 02:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
would dis it looks like page 29 was from
 
02:13:59.870 --> 02:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
an earlier version as we were updating
 
02:14:02.069 --> 02:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
it so I I would go ahead and strike out
 
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
on your document page 29 as the accurate
 
02:14:08.189 --> 02:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
numbers are located on page 30 apologize
 
02:14:10.030 --> 02:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
for that okay because I was trying to
 
02:14:12.229 --> 02:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
figure out are these two different two
 
02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
different things but okay um so I guess
 
02:14:17.790 --> 02:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
is what exactly does the department need
 
02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
funding to do and um because this is not
 
02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
the attorneys this is not the children's
 
02:14:31.229 --> 02:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:34.229 --> 02:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
children so our fiscal note contemplated
 
02:14:38.189 --> 02:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
uh an additional 14 cpsws so so what we
 
02:14:40.390 --> 02:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
know and appreciate and and we believe
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
that kids Express rights um deserve to
 
02:14:45.709 --> 02:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
be um brought to the attention of the
 
02:14:47.629 --> 02:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
court and all the parties we also know
 
02:14:50.069 --> 02:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
that there'll be additional um needs on
 
02:14:53.350 --> 02:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
the on the on on the behalf of our of
 
02:14:56.149 --> 02:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
our child protective uh case workers um
 
02:14:58.629 --> 02:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
having meetings with kids to inform them
 
02:15:00.310 --> 02:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
of their rights filling out forms for
 
02:15:02.350 --> 02:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
kids that are going to
 
02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
um for all of the kids in residential
 
02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
treatment plus other kids um who uh
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
request um an attorney we know that um
 
02:15:13.510 --> 02:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
because this is for residential
 
02:15:17.750 --> 02:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
treatment um to contemplate that most
 
02:15:20.470 --> 02:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
youth will have the expressed wish to
 
02:15:22.229 --> 02:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
remain in residential treatment is
 
02:15:25.629 --> 02:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
unlikely um we anticipate there'll be um
 
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
motions um hearings um additional work
 
02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
being done with with those attorneys to
 
02:15:33.109 --> 02:15:33.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are able to meet those
 
02:15:33.119 --> 02:15:37.549 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are able to meet those
youth

02:15:37.549 --> 02:15:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
needs so can you I guess I I have a hard
 
02:15:42.709 --> 02:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
time understanding what
 
02:15:46.109 --> 02:15:46.119 align:start position:0%
14 new positions would do I mean you're
 
02:15:48.430 --> 02:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
you're informing the children they're
 
02:15:50.709 --> 02:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
already they're already have I assume
 
02:15:53.310 --> 02:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
they already have a social worker yes
 
02:15:55.990 --> 02:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
they already have a social worker how
 
02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
much time would this add if say they
 
02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
were no CPA no for no new 14 how much
 
02:16:06.589 --> 02:16:06.599 align:start position:0%
time would this add do you think to the
 
02:16:10.709 --> 02:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
average social workers work with their
 
02:16:13.589 --> 02:16:13.599 align:start position:0%
clients I think it it's it's it will be
 
02:16:15.549 --> 02:16:15.559 align:start position:0%
the court hearings and and the motions
 
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
and working with the attorneys that
 
02:16:19.950 --> 02:16:19.960 align:start position:0%
would be um most of the time um yes
 
02:16:22.030 --> 02:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
there'd be forms and and discussions
 
02:16:24.310 --> 02:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
that need to be held but we anticipate
 
02:16:26.270 --> 02:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
the majority of the time will be spent
 
02:16:29.390 --> 02:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
court or in working with those attorneys
 
02:16:34.629 --> 02:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
around again the expressed wishes of
 
02:16:36.910 --> 02:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
those of those youth
 
02:16:41.429 --> 02:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
impacted so the 14 amounts to about one
 
02:16:44.309 --> 02:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
new cpsw per area with a couple of our
 
02:16:46.709 --> 02:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
larger offices receiving two but so it
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
would be one additional cpsw to spread
 
02:16:51.790 --> 02:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
the casework respon
 
02:16:54.070 --> 02:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility so presently since the
 
02:16:57.509 --> 02:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
children don't get a
 
02:17:00.589 --> 02:17:00.599 align:start position:0%
lawyer that work doesn't get
 
02:17:05.070 --> 02:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
done or are the cpsws having
 
02:17:08.469 --> 02:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
to do some of that work in
 
02:17:11.509 --> 02:17:11.519 align:start position:0%
court well they currently all of the
 
02:17:13.230 --> 02:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
children receive a guardian at lium
 
02:17:14.750 --> 02:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
which could be a casa or an attorney
 
02:17:17.549 --> 02:17:17.559 align:start position:0%
guard Guardian lium um and and those
 
02:17:19.509 --> 02:17:19.519 align:start position:0%
people are um looking into the best
 
02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
interest of the children and might not
 
02:17:23.509 --> 02:17:23.519 align:start position:0%
align with the child's
 
02:17:27.750 --> 02:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
interest so this with with the council
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
that would be coming on board it's the
 
02:17:32.469 --> 02:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
express interest so what the child is
 
02:17:34.589 --> 02:17:34.599 align:start position:0%
saying they want regardless of what
 
02:17:36.030 --> 02:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
someone else thinks is their best
 
02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
interest so we'll have a guardian of
 
02:17:44.070 --> 02:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
lium per for each child and also um a
 
02:17:46.389 --> 02:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
cour a court appointed attorney um
 
02:17:49.150 --> 02:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
talking about what the child wishes so
 
02:17:51.629 --> 02:17:51.639 align:start position:0%
we anticipate with the residential
 
02:17:53.709 --> 02:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
treatment that there there will be
 
02:17:57.150 --> 02:17:57.160 align:start position:0%
additional um many additional steps to
 
02:17:58.990 --> 02:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
be taken uh with a child protective
 
02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
worker with that attorney with perhaps
 
02:18:03.509 --> 02:18:03.519 align:start position:0%
court with motions with filings and
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
discuss discussion around what else we
 
02:18:08.389 --> 02:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
could do to meet that child's needs um
 
02:18:10.750 --> 02:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
that would be new than than is currently
 
02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:12.669 align:start position:0%
that would be new than than is currently
happening

02:18:12.669 --> 02:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
happening
 
02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
today so presently though the social
 
02:18:18.389 --> 02:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
worker must be meeting with the casus
 
02:18:20.910 --> 02:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
and the guardian at Liams right yes so
 
02:18:24.629 --> 02:18:24.639 align:start position:0%
they're already involved in doing some
 
02:18:27.950 --> 02:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
of that kind of oversight making sure
 
02:18:31.070 --> 02:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
that everyone's I guess doing what
 
02:18:33.389 --> 02:18:33.399 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be doing that's
 
02:18:35.469 --> 02:18:35.479 align:start position:0%
correct that falls to the social worker
 
02:18:38.709 --> 02:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
at this time yes it does okay I guess I
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
still have a really hard time
 
02:18:43.030 --> 02:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
understanding how having the child have
 
02:18:43.950 --> 02:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
their own
 
02:18:46.429 --> 02:18:46.439 align:start position:0%
lawyer is going
 
02:18:48.910 --> 02:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
to cause it to be more work for the
 
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
social worker but I'll take your word
 
02:18:53.190 --> 02:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
for it that at least the department
 
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
thinks it it would increase the uh the
 
02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:59.070 align:start position:0%
thinks it it would increase the uh the
need

02:18:59.070 --> 02:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:04.910 --> 02:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
um so this was all it was also in the
 
02:19:08.190 --> 02:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
legislation it was going to be phased in
 
02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
so it would be
 
02:19:14.549 --> 02:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
just a few children and then added I
 
02:19:16.589 --> 02:19:16.599 align:start position:0%
think it was by age that's correct that
 
02:19:19.669 --> 02:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
they were going to be phased in and even
 
02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
at at even with the phase in you still
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
feel like you still need 14 additional
 
02:19:28.990 --> 02:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
workers yes we we do believe best
 
02:19:30.950 --> 02:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
interest and express interest are going
 
02:19:33.990 --> 02:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
to be two very different things and so
 
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
we anticipate needing needing another
 
02:19:38.230 --> 02:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
staff in each office uh due to the
 
02:19:40.429 --> 02:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
additional work that will be on each of
 
02:19:40.439 --> 02:19:41.309 align:start position:0%
additional work that will be on each of
our

02:19:41.309 --> 02:19:41.319 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:19:44.750 --> 02:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
staff thank you representative Stringham
 
02:19:46.669 --> 02:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
for a question yeah I'm sure we have a
 
02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
few weeks to go over it but it seemed to
 
02:19:51.150 --> 02:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
me that I U my memory of of the
 
02:19:53.309 --> 02:19:53.319 align:start position:0%
discussion we had on this that they
 
02:19:56.590 --> 02:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
thought there was at least equal
 
02:19:59.309 --> 02:19:59.319 align:start position:0%
offsetting um expenses in another
 
02:20:02.389 --> 02:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
category by by adding the staff and I
 
02:20:03.950 --> 02:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
don't know if you can speak to that or
 
02:20:06.750 --> 02:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
whether we'll just wait and uh see if my
 
02:20:09.510 --> 02:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
memory is accurate and uh in in the
 
02:20:10.950 --> 02:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
process of working on the budget over
 
02:20:13.349 --> 02:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
the next few weeks I don't think I can
 
02:20:15.950 --> 02:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
speaked to that I'm
 
02:20:19.469 --> 02:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
sorry and and and just for General uh
 
02:20:22.830 --> 02:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
awareness um s SP 463 it was passed
 
02:20:25.710 --> 02:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
during the legislative session of 2024
 
02:20:29.630 --> 02:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
but it had a July 1 of 2025 start date
 
02:20:32.710 --> 02:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
so starting in the next B anym and so
 
02:20:34.750 --> 02:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
there's um there's two components to the
 
02:20:38.590 --> 02:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
prioritize need one is the cpsws here
 
02:20:41.349 --> 02:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
and then there's also there was a um
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
prioritized need relative to dcyf
 
02:20:47.790 --> 02:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
attorneys five dcyf attorneys but those
 
02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
attorneys are actually budgeted in legal
 
02:20:52.790 --> 02:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
and Regulatory Affair so when Melissa sa
 
02:20:55.950 --> 02:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
SE was here maybe almost two weeks ago
 
02:20:58.950 --> 02:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
now um that that that would impact her
 
02:21:00.870 --> 02:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
budget area and and those were the costs
 
02:21:03.150 --> 02:21:03.160 align:start position:0%
that were recognized in the Department's
 
02:21:05.510 --> 02:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
analysis that showed up in the um in the
 
02:21:08.550 --> 02:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
lb's fiscal note uh on that bill but
 
02:21:10.110 --> 02:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
that bill made no
 
02:21:13.110 --> 02:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation and currently in the draft
 
02:21:16.950 --> 02:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
hb2 um that uh that particular effective
 
02:21:19.150 --> 02:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
date has been delayed until the start of
 
02:21:37.510 --> 02:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:39.870 --> 02:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
anym moving to slide
 
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
32 can can we I have questions on slide
 
02:21:46.510 --> 02:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
30 sorry oh sure just looking down the
 
02:21:51.710 --> 02:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs there on slide 30 um
 
02:21:53.429 --> 02:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
can you just maybe we touched on this
 
02:21:56.950 --> 02:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
and I apologize that $9 million in 27
 
02:21:58.349 --> 02:21:58.359 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid loss of funding for
 
02:22:02.790 --> 02:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
residential what is that sure so
 
02:22:05.990 --> 02:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
we we included in our original agency
 
02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
budget request an $18 million general
 
02:22:10.870 --> 02:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
fund request for the loss of the
 
02:22:12.710 --> 02:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid dollars and that goes back to
 
02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
the discussion relative to the the qrtp
 
02:22:18.510 --> 02:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
IMD where we're no longer um going to be
 
02:22:21.230 --> 02:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
able to claim those Medicaid funds
 
02:22:23.389 --> 02:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
that's been partially funded in in the
 
02:22:25.950 --> 02:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
in the governor's recommended budget um
 
02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
so so the $9 million is the anticipated
 
02:22:32.030 --> 02:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
um remaining amount that that that we
 
02:22:37.510 --> 02:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
request representative Stringham for a
 
02:22:41.309 --> 02:22:41.319 align:start position:0%
question can you comment on the
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
residential rate increase and Foster
 
02:22:45.950 --> 02:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
Care rate increases what percentage that
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
I I can I can go back and get you what
 
02:22:58.670 --> 02:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
percentage that may represent I think
 
02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
what's important to understand is that
 
02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean a 4% increase for
 
02:23:07.710 --> 02:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
everybody um that number was based on an
 
02:23:10.190 --> 02:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
analysis where we collected uh cost
 
02:23:12.510 --> 02:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
report data from the residential
 
02:23:14.950 --> 02:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
treatment providers and we looked at
 
02:23:17.469 --> 02:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
what the costs were to deliver the
 
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
services and and so that number
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
represents that level of analysis and so
 
02:23:25.150 --> 02:23:25.160 align:start position:0%
there would be variations between each
 
02:23:27.710 --> 02:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
of those residential providers um so
 
02:23:29.870 --> 02:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's not a it's not necessarily a fixed
 
02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
rate we can provide that to okay um for
 
02:23:42.110 --> 02:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
the Foster Care uh rate increases and
 
02:23:44.389 --> 02:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
and again we we realize there's costs
 
02:23:46.910 --> 02:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
here but these both residential and
 
02:23:49.150 --> 02:23:49.160 align:start position:0%
Foster Care are essential services to
 
02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
our service array um to ensure that kids
 
02:23:54.110 --> 02:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
receive the treatment kids we have
 
02:23:56.190 --> 02:23:56.200 align:start position:0%
places for kids to go who require out of
 
02:23:58.110 --> 02:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
home care because their their their home
 
02:23:59.790 --> 02:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
is dangerous right so that's when we
 
02:24:01.870 --> 02:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
remove when we determine that a child is
 
02:24:03.910 --> 02:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
not safe in their home so we we need
 
02:24:06.190 --> 02:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
these available options um to be able to
 
02:24:08.389 --> 02:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
serve New Hampshire's children um in
 
02:24:10.870 --> 02:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
regard to the foster care rate increases
 
02:24:13.870 --> 02:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
um there is a calculation um regarding
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
cost of living uh cost to raise a child
 
02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
so there there is a a method that we um
 
02:24:21.429 --> 02:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
calculated in order to um consider what
 
02:24:24.070 --> 02:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
kind of foster care raises should happen
 
02:24:27.190 --> 02:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
um on an annual basis um to to ensure
 
02:24:28.670 --> 02:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
that people can care for for the
 
02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
children that placed in their home and
 
02:24:33.790 --> 02:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
so I do have the daily foster care rates
 
02:24:36.710 --> 02:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
um in the anticipated rate per day um
 
02:24:40.070 --> 02:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
and just in general um for State fiscal
 
02:24:44.389 --> 02:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
year 2025 um they range from about $34 a
 
02:24:47.429 --> 02:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
day um up to about $50 a day depending
 
02:24:50.429 --> 02:24:50.439 align:start position:0%
on the the age um of the child and then
 
02:24:52.510 --> 02:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
we also have other specialized kinds of
 
02:24:55.550 --> 02:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
rates um emergency or crisis um care
 
02:24:57.710 --> 02:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
that a family may provide to us so we
 
02:24:59.510 --> 02:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
can provide you these rates so that you
 
02:25:02.030 --> 02:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
can see the the rate increases over time
 
02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:14.830 --> 02:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
established I follow up um um the
 
02:25:16.510 --> 02:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
residential rate increase which is a
 
02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
cost based
 
02:25:21.590 --> 02:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so um if if if we don't
 
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
provide this amount the we would have to
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh necessarily reduce the number of of
 
02:25:30.349 --> 02:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
uh residential units that we have
 
02:25:33.349 --> 02:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
available to meet the budget so what
 
02:25:35.950 --> 02:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
what it would mean is
 
02:25:38.830 --> 02:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
um pot potentially a couple of different
 
02:25:41.190 --> 02:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
things one is we hold the daily
 
02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate steady with with no
 
02:25:47.190 --> 02:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
change um so for the current state
 
02:25:49.750 --> 02:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year there were no increases
 
02:25:51.349 --> 02:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
because there there was no money
 
02:25:53.429 --> 02:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
budgeted for that purpose if the
 
02:25:55.389 --> 02:25:55.399 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs request is not
 
02:25:58.110 --> 02:25:58.120 align:start position:0%
approved then um we wouldn't have money
 
02:26:02.110 --> 02:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
to provide rate increases for 26 or
 
02:26:05.910 --> 02:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
27 and similarly for foster care the the
 
02:26:07.870 --> 02:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
prioritize need would cover the
 
02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
anticipated rate increases that we um
 
02:26:13.269 --> 02:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
have calculated for foster
 
02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
care representative walner for question
 
02:26:18.150 --> 02:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
did I understand you to just say there
 
02:26:21.710 --> 02:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
was no rate increase for Foster care or
 
02:26:24.870 --> 02:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment Residential Care
 
02:26:29.269 --> 02:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
in this bium the one no there there was
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
so the the the first year for
 
02:26:33.550 --> 02:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
residential there there was a rate
 
02:26:35.790 --> 02:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
increase but in the second year of the
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
bayum we didn't have funds sufficient to
 
02:26:41.150 --> 02:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
provide that rate increase in the second
 
02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
year so they got one rate increase
 
02:26:45.150 --> 02:26:45.160 align:start position:0%
during the the bium yes for for
 
02:26:47.670 --> 02:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
residential yes and what about foster
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
care did they have a rate increase
 
02:26:53.269 --> 02:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
yes I believe they did one rate rate
 
02:26:53.279 --> 02:26:58.110 align:start position:0%
yes I believe they did one rate rate
increase

02:26:58.110 --> 02:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
okay and and to your question U
 
02:27:02.349 --> 02:27:02.359 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham regarding
 
02:27:05.429 --> 02:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
residential treatment so certainly we we
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
hear from providers um the challenges
 
02:27:10.469 --> 02:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
that they have to meet their budget um
 
02:27:13.150 --> 02:27:13.160 align:start position:0%
and so it it does concern us that not
 
02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
being able to provide the funding that
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
they need to run their program could
 
02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
minimize the the number of programs or
 
02:27:20.910 --> 02:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
beds that we have would could cause us
 
02:27:23.590 --> 02:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
to need uh additional beds out of out of
 
02:27:26.349 --> 02:27:26.359 align:start position:0%
state um out of state programs are
 
02:27:28.030 --> 02:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
certainly more costly we're sending
 
02:27:30.110 --> 02:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
staff out to visit these programs on a
 
02:27:33.389 --> 02:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
monthly basis to meet uh with kids in in
 
02:27:35.910 --> 02:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
in the program areas um who serve them
 
02:27:38.190 --> 02:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
so you know we certainly hope that we
 
02:27:40.750 --> 02:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
can at a minimum keep the programs that
 
02:27:46.030 --> 02:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:49.230 --> 02:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
state representative n valeno for a
 
02:27:51.830 --> 02:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
question n
 
02:27:54.510 --> 02:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
I uh this is just kind of a curiosity
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
question we send kids to other states
 
02:27:59.830 --> 02:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
and other states have their own programs
 
02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
for handling this what what interaction
 
02:28:04.870 --> 02:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
or is there any potential for you know
 
02:28:07.469 --> 02:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
instead of doing the travel there um
 
02:28:08.710 --> 02:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
cooperating with other states
 
02:28:11.309 --> 02:28:11.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursing them and and everybody saves
 
02:28:14.990 --> 02:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
money by having it handled you know in
 
02:28:17.590 --> 02:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
the location where the where the child
 
02:28:20.389 --> 02:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
is actually located
 
02:28:21.990 --> 02:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
there is actually a process for that
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
called the interstate compact for the
 
02:28:25.269 --> 02:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
placement of children and it allows for
 
02:28:27.550 --> 02:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
that reciprocity and that capacity for
 
02:28:29.910 --> 02:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
other states to monitor the children in
 
02:28:32.269 --> 02:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
their state um with the passage of
 
02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 417 uh we are now
 
02:28:38.469 --> 02:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
legislatively required to go out the the
 
02:28:40.469 --> 02:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
person that knows the child to do to do
 
02:28:42.590 --> 02:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
those visits directly so that is a
 
02:28:44.670 --> 02:28:44.680 align:start position:0%
direct impact of that legislation so we
 
02:28:47.269 --> 02:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
will always be traveling to meet with
 
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
the children in our Care on a monthly
 
02:28:52.150 --> 02:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
basis so so if I understand we're not
 
02:28:55.349 --> 02:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
really taking full advantage of the
 
02:28:57.910 --> 02:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
compact as it relates to to Residential
 
02:29:02.590 --> 02:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:05.429 --> 02:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
you representative tki I was just for
 
02:29:10.830 --> 02:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
the representative um s SP 417 was um
 
02:29:14.230 --> 02:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
came out of an unfortunate situation of
 
02:29:15.750 --> 02:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire children that were in an
 
02:29:18.230 --> 02:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
out of-state placement that was unsafe
 
02:29:21.710 --> 02:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
to them and inhumane and and um so the
 
02:29:23.710 --> 02:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
legislation was filed to protect the
 
02:29:25.510 --> 02:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
children and make sure that they have
 
02:29:29.710 --> 02:29:29.720 align:start position:0%
more regular um visits from um people
 
02:29:30.990 --> 02:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
here in the granite state who were
 
02:29:33.269 --> 02:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
looking out for their
 
02:29:35.790 --> 02:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
Care thank you that's kind of
 
02:29:37.469 --> 02:29:37.479 align:start position:0%
educational for me because I'm new to
 
02:29:37.479 --> 02:29:42.670 align:start position:0%
educational for me because I'm new to
the

02:29:42.670 --> 02:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:46.030 --> 02:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
uh um moving to slide 32 which is
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
essentially the the the last detailed
 
02:29:51.590 --> 02:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
slide that I have here um this is simply
 
02:29:53.830 --> 02:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
a depiction of some of the service
 
02:29:55.910 --> 02:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
delivery impacts and and how that
 
02:29:58.870 --> 02:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
affects our case workers um at DCF and
 
02:30:01.750 --> 02:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
so ultimately case workers are
 
02:30:04.389 --> 02:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
responsible for for the needs of the the
 
02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
children and families on their case load
 
02:30:10.309 --> 02:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
and so when we have um fiscal impacts
 
02:30:13.070 --> 02:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
that that impact things like foster care
 
02:30:15.070 --> 02:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
and foster parents and and residential
 
02:30:17.590 --> 02:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
rates and transportation um cuts or
 
02:30:20.750 --> 02:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
inability to provide the rate that um
 
02:30:23.070 --> 02:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
that meets the the provider needs that
 
02:30:25.950 --> 02:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
does fall on on the casew worker um in a
 
02:30:27.550 --> 02:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
recent example our transportation
 
02:30:29.469 --> 02:30:29.479 align:start position:0%
provider needed to to cut back some of
 
02:30:31.150 --> 02:30:31.160 align:start position:0%
the work that they did so what that
 
02:30:33.309 --> 02:30:33.319 align:start position:0%
means is our case workers are getting up
 
02:30:35.710 --> 02:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
before work they're traveling to pick up
 
02:30:38.429 --> 02:30:38.439 align:start position:0%
children um drive them to school um
 
02:30:41.269 --> 02:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
drive them to family time and visits um
 
02:30:44.630 --> 02:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
if we have foster parents and um that
 
02:30:46.670 --> 02:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
that we can't retain or they're impacted
 
02:30:49.349 --> 02:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
by finances it means fewer foster homes
 
02:30:52.190 --> 02:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
it means our staff traveling to visit
 
02:30:53.990 --> 02:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
children further and further away
 
02:30:56.230 --> 02:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
whether that's in residential um or
 
02:30:58.950 --> 02:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
foster care um so really I I just wanted
 
02:31:01.510 --> 02:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
to make the connection between sometimes
 
02:31:03.550 --> 02:31:03.560 align:start position:0%
just not having some of
 
02:31:05.630 --> 02:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
this it doesn't mean it's just simply
 
02:31:07.110 --> 02:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
not available it means it has to get
 
02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
picked up somewhere and the majority of
 
02:31:10.349 --> 02:31:10.359 align:start position:0%
these things get picked up by our case
 
02:31:12.670 --> 02:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
workers um who are extremely dedicated
 
02:31:14.790 --> 02:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
passionate about the work that they do
 
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
um again we're available 24 hours a day
 
02:31:19.750 --> 02:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
7 days a week uh meeting the needs of
 
02:31:23.590 --> 02:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
our our most vulnerable population um
 
02:31:25.230 --> 02:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
and so I just I wanted to be able to
 
02:31:27.950 --> 02:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
highlight that here uh to just um show
 
02:31:29.710 --> 02:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
how that does impact the work we do and
 
02:31:31.469 --> 02:31:31.479 align:start position:0%
ultimately when when our case workers
 
02:31:33.550 --> 02:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
are doing some more of those ancillary
 
02:31:35.309 --> 02:31:35.319 align:start position:0%
um aspects of the work they're they're
 
02:31:37.349 --> 02:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
ultimately spending less time uh doing
 
02:31:39.389 --> 02:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
their case work uh with with Children
 
02:31:39.399 --> 02:31:42.190 align:start position:0%
their case work uh with with Children
and

02:31:42.190 --> 02:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:44.429 --> 02:31:44.439 align:start position:0%
Families representative Daniels for
 
02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
question thank you can visitations be
 
02:31:50.510 --> 02:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:53.950 --> 02:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
so we do some off um so in addition to
 
02:31:56.309 --> 02:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
our monthly face-to-face contact which
 
02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
which must happen we do um in between we
 
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
can do some kinds of virtual contact uh
 
02:32:04.349 --> 02:32:04.359 align:start position:0%
phone contact or video conference
 
02:32:06.469 --> 02:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
certainly support families um who can't
 
02:32:09.110 --> 02:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
make um a meeting to be able to do so
 
02:32:11.910 --> 02:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
remotely but we are required um inperson
 
02:32:16.429 --> 02:32:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:18.630 --> 02:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
monthly representative Stringham for a
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
question I'm and thank you for for this
 
02:32:23.110 --> 02:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
slide and of course all the all the work
 
02:32:26.150 --> 02:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
that uh you and your staff do uh for the
 
02:32:28.990 --> 02:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
children in our state and and I had
 
02:32:31.150 --> 02:32:31.160 align:start position:0%
written down this question to ask you
 
02:32:34.230 --> 02:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
what you thought uh the state of mind
 
02:32:36.269 --> 02:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
and of the case workers are are they
 
02:32:38.870 --> 02:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
feeling overburdened are they on the
 
02:32:42.590 --> 02:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
brink of being burned out or are they uh
 
02:32:44.750 --> 02:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know kind of in a happier place
 
02:32:48.110 --> 02:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
how would you overall um
 
02:32:51.110 --> 02:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
characterize uh where we we are in here
 
02:32:53.309 --> 02:32:53.319 align:start position:0%
and uh if you have any
 
02:32:56.030 --> 02:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations um you know outside of
 
02:32:57.630 --> 02:32:57.640 align:start position:0%
what's in the budget already it'd be
 
02:33:00.150 --> 02:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
interested as well yeah thank you for
 
02:33:02.030 --> 02:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
that question
 
02:33:05.110 --> 02:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
um I child welfare work Child Protection
 
02:33:07.550 --> 02:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice is is challenging it's
 
02:33:10.349 --> 02:33:10.359 align:start position:0%
tough the secondary trauma is intense um
 
02:33:12.590 --> 02:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
the things that they see experience read
 
02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
talk to kids about um it's very very
 
02:33:20.349 --> 02:33:20.359 align:start position:0%
difficult and challenging um
 
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday I was in a a meeting with our
 
02:33:24.110 --> 02:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
our management team so group of our
 
02:33:26.309 --> 02:33:26.319 align:start position:0%
senior supervisors administrators and I
 
02:33:28.309 --> 02:33:28.319 align:start position:0%
was hearing them talk to me as I'm
 
02:33:29.990 --> 02:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
talking about our priorities about how
 
02:33:33.389 --> 02:33:33.399 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed their staff are um all good
 
02:33:35.550 --> 02:33:35.560 align:start position:0%
things Senate Bill 417 is very
 
02:33:38.429 --> 02:33:38.439 align:start position:0%
complicated requires a lot of their time
 
02:33:41.190 --> 02:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh we've had countless new forms and
 
02:33:42.990 --> 02:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
processes and standard operating
 
02:33:45.030 --> 02:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
procedures you know as a result of
 
02:33:46.670 --> 02:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
something that seems like really good
 
02:33:48.469 --> 02:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
legislation and and we do want to
 
02:33:50.070 --> 02:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
protect kids we want to be there for
 
02:33:52.309 --> 02:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
kids but each and every one thing that
 
02:33:54.830 --> 02:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
happens has a immense ripple effect on
 
02:33:57.790 --> 02:33:57.800 align:start position:0%
our staff so our our staff our staff are
 
02:34:00.469 --> 02:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed um we try to support the
 
02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
best we can um we we have that safety
 
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
culture team that I mentioned in the
 
02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
director's office budget trying to
 
02:34:09.630 --> 02:34:09.640 align:start position:0%
support their secondary trauma needs um
 
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
what we know is any bit of negative
 
02:34:15.070 --> 02:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
media attention whether it's YDC
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
litigation whether it's other litigation
 
02:34:19.429 --> 02:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
whether it's a story from 10 years ago
 
02:34:20.950 --> 02:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
um what what that does and the impact
 
02:34:23.349 --> 02:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
that that has on our staff um is pretty
 
02:34:26.950 --> 02:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
intense um it erodes Family Trust it
 
02:34:28.790 --> 02:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
erodes the way that people communicate
 
02:34:30.830 --> 02:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
with us it erodes the way Community
 
02:34:33.429 --> 02:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
Partners communicate with us um our
 
02:34:36.790 --> 02:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
staff get threatened all of the time um
 
02:34:39.830 --> 02:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
we were at a pretty a pretty um High we
 
02:34:42.950 --> 02:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
we have documented 50 threats uh to our
 
02:34:45.630 --> 02:34:45.640 align:start position:0%
staff in calendar year 2024 so we track
 
02:34:47.870 --> 02:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
that we try to support them we offer
 
02:34:51.429 --> 02:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
them um help um but it's it it is a very
 
02:34:53.870 --> 02:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
challenging job and uh while we've made
 
02:34:56.309 --> 02:34:56.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of progress on our retention um
 
02:34:57.870 --> 02:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
that just speaks to the commitment of
 
02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
our team um and their ability to to
 
02:35:02.630 --> 02:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
stick with it and to want to do better
 
02:35:05.670 --> 02:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
for kids and families and so we remain
 
02:35:07.630 --> 02:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
fully committed we remain wanting to
 
02:35:09.150 --> 02:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
always do better we have a lot of work
 
02:35:12.429 --> 02:35:12.439 align:start position:0%
to do we acknowledge that um it's nice
 
02:35:14.110 --> 02:35:14.120 align:start position:0%
to also acknowledge some of the good
 
02:35:16.150 --> 02:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
work that we do for our staff to feel
 
02:35:18.349 --> 02:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
like people know that the commitment
 
02:35:19.870 --> 02:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
that they have the good work that they
 
02:35:23.750 --> 02:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
do the 247 operation that we maintain um
 
02:35:26.110 --> 02:35:26.120 align:start position:0%
so overall I appreciate your your
 
02:35:28.670 --> 02:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
question it's it's tough at es and flows
 
02:35:31.389 --> 02:35:31.399 align:start position:0%
depending um on the temperature in in
 
02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
the community um and on uh the new
 
02:35:36.030 --> 02:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
practices that that roll out and and
 
02:35:38.670 --> 02:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
come to fruition but um we remain a
 
02:35:44.269 --> 02:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:47.550 --> 02:35:47.560 align:start position:0%
people representative Nano for question
 
02:35:50.670 --> 02:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
yeah first of all I'd like to uh uh
 
02:35:52.750 --> 02:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
commend you for the uh presentation that
 
02:35:54.990 --> 02:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
you given today very uh informative very
 
02:35:57.030 --> 02:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
detailed thank you U you know subject to
 
02:35:59.349 --> 02:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
getting some of the simplification on
 
02:36:01.630 --> 02:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
where the money was moving around but
 
02:36:03.790 --> 02:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if uh you know you made
 
02:36:06.349 --> 02:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
mention of the fact that you've got a a
 
02:36:08.870 --> 02:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
whole array of complex rules regulations
 
02:36:10.870 --> 02:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
and everything is there anything that U
 
02:36:13.710 --> 02:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
you know U you might do to recommend the
 
02:36:18.429 --> 02:36:18.439 align:start position:0%
legislature places where we could um uh
 
02:36:20.950 --> 02:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
reduce the without harming without
 
02:36:23.830 --> 02:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
harming any of the uh quality of the
 
02:36:26.150 --> 02:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
services that you could you from your
 
02:36:27.590 --> 02:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
side of it could say say some of these
 
02:36:30.590 --> 02:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
rules these regulations and
 
02:36:33.070 --> 02:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
administrative aspects of this could be
 
02:36:35.950 --> 02:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
streamlined or simplified that would at
 
02:36:40.510 --> 02:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
one and the same time uh improve the
 
02:36:42.790 --> 02:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
operations quality and maybe even
 
02:36:46.510 --> 02:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
contribute to uh the
 
02:36:48.750 --> 02:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
morale I can give some more thought to
 
02:36:51.150 --> 02:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
that you know I think we appreciate the
 
02:36:52.830 --> 02:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility even in some of our
 
02:36:55.630 --> 02:36:55.640 align:start position:0%
contracts um it it it it would be nice
 
02:36:58.510 --> 02:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
to know that if we do really significant
 
02:37:00.830 --> 02:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
active contract management so knowing
 
02:37:02.630 --> 02:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
that we could have the ability to say
 
02:37:04.750 --> 02:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
you know this contract isn't living up
 
02:37:06.710 --> 02:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
maybe to the the benefits that we would
 
02:37:08.429 --> 02:37:08.439 align:start position:0%
have hoped for for families so be able
 
02:37:10.349 --> 02:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
to Pivot that money and and apply it in
 
02:37:13.110 --> 02:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
a way that is um for the services that
 
02:37:15.429 --> 02:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
work right that flexibility is is
 
02:37:17.550 --> 02:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
greatly appreciated I think anything
 
02:37:21.510 --> 02:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
that we can also do around prevention
 
02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
so serving families outside of the
 
02:37:29.429 --> 02:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
DCF agency is is where and it's not to
 
02:37:31.590 --> 02:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
divert the the work that dcyf needs to
 
02:37:33.469 --> 02:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
do I know the work that we need to do
 
02:37:34.910 --> 02:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
you you probably all see the work that
 
02:37:38.670 --> 02:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
we need to do but there has to be equal
 
02:37:41.630 --> 02:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
attention on the outside of the system
 
02:37:43.269 --> 02:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
the education system the medical
 
02:37:45.469 --> 02:37:45.479 align:start position:0%
providers the folks that see families
 
02:37:47.830 --> 02:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
and kids every single day that can catch
 
02:37:50.710 --> 02:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
that kid that they notice in school uh
 
02:37:52.790 --> 02:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
drifting off that that that they're
 
02:37:54.910 --> 02:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
knowing is staying up late you know
 
02:37:56.550 --> 02:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps something's going on in the home
 
02:37:59.750 --> 02:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
so there's there's such an array of 211
 
02:38:01.469 --> 02:38:01.479 align:start position:0%
and other services Family Resource
 
02:38:03.510 --> 02:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
Centers um places that we can point
 
02:38:05.910 --> 02:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
families and and and catch them before
 
02:38:08.710 --> 02:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
they get to the the place of um you know
 
02:38:11.150 --> 02:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
an unfortunate uh neglect or abusive
 
02:38:13.389 --> 02:38:13.399 align:start position:0%
situation happening we know abuse often
 
02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
happens in the context of everyday
 
02:38:17.429 --> 02:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
events we know most families don't wake
 
02:38:18.870 --> 02:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
up and say I'm going to abuse my child
 
02:38:20.870 --> 02:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
today right there's things that happen
 
02:38:23.790 --> 02:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
and and families are complex systems and
 
02:38:27.269 --> 02:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
so I think as a as a community as a as a
 
02:38:29.750 --> 02:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
as a group of citizens in New Hampshire
 
02:38:31.990 --> 02:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
um to the extent that we can consider
 
02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
how we um divert attention um to the
 
02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
earlier point in our communities um and
 
02:38:41.150 --> 02:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
away from our system is is really where
 
02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
I I hope to see a large focus of our
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
work I I just make one other uh further
 
02:38:50.389 --> 02:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
comment is that certainly I have a
 
02:38:53.790 --> 02:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
vested interest I have 15 grandkids and
 
02:38:56.910 --> 02:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
have five uh adult children that are
 
02:38:59.190 --> 02:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
that are married so I have some
 
02:39:02.510 --> 02:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
familiarity with the issues and the uh
 
02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
and the challenges uh that are presented
 
02:39:09.190 --> 02:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
so I you know you're doing great work
 
02:39:12.950 --> 02:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
and uh hopefully we can uh help you do
 
02:39:14.990 --> 02:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
it in a more efficient cost effective
 
02:39:18.550 --> 02:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
and and uh timely manner thank you
 
02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative Daniel for a question
 
02:39:23.070 --> 02:39:23.080 align:start position:0%
thank you compared to the intake numbers
 
02:39:24.630 --> 02:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
there are significant numbers of
 
02:39:27.750 --> 02:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
screened out things have you given any
 
02:39:30.190 --> 02:39:30.200 align:start position:0%
thought as to how you might be able to
 
02:39:33.469 --> 02:39:33.479 align:start position:0%
educate people so that you don't get the
 
02:39:35.670 --> 02:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
the the calls that don't amount to
 
02:39:38.150 --> 02:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
anything and thereby save time for the
 
02:39:41.550 --> 02:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
workers that's a great question thank
 
02:39:44.030 --> 02:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
you um we actually were working through
 
02:39:45.750 --> 02:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
a program where we were trying to
 
02:39:48.550 --> 02:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
consider how to provide the community it
 
02:39:50.670 --> 02:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
was a community Response Guide um how to
 
02:39:52.590 --> 02:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
provide the community alternatives to
 
02:39:55.550 --> 02:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
reporting um there was mixed reaction uh
 
02:39:57.429 --> 02:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
from many of our community stakeholders
 
02:39:58.990 --> 02:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
being concerned that people would begin
 
02:40:01.510 --> 02:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
to under report um but I think there is
 
02:40:04.830 --> 02:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
an Avenue to potentially consider um how
 
02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:05.830 align:start position:0%
an Avenue to potentially consider um how
to

02:40:05.830 --> 02:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:40:08.790 --> 02:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
have um in in this model it was going to
 
02:40:10.670 --> 02:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
be almost like a decision-making tree
 
02:40:13.870 --> 02:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
but less in my opinion less about should
 
02:40:16.070 --> 02:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
I report to DCF if I'm thinking I should
 
02:40:19.349 --> 02:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
report to DCF I should report to DCF uh
 
02:40:21.429 --> 02:40:21.439 align:start position:0%
what we know because we surveyed um some
 
02:40:23.790 --> 02:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
of our reporters is that um it was
 
02:40:26.710 --> 02:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
something like 70% of reporters called
 
02:40:29.269 --> 02:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
in a report to DCF not because they
 
02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
actually suspected abuse neglect but
 
02:40:32.670 --> 02:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
because they knew a family needed help
 
02:40:34.990 --> 02:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
and they didn't know what else to do and
 
02:40:37.150 --> 02:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
so um the the effort that we were doing
 
02:40:39.750 --> 02:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
was trying to be a a a Community
 
02:40:42.790 --> 02:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
Education a a response guide to say I
 
02:40:44.389 --> 02:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
this family needs help let me walk
 
02:40:46.830 --> 02:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
through this online tool maybe the
 
02:40:49.630 --> 02:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
outcome will be a report to DCF Maybe it
 
02:40:51.429 --> 02:40:51.439 align:start position:0%
will be something else it could be again
 
02:40:55.830 --> 02:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
211 a a a pantry um a hotline number a
 
02:40:57.750 --> 02:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
lot of a lot of people realize that
 
02:40:59.150 --> 02:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
something's happening but they don't
 
02:41:02.710 --> 02:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
know what to do about it to help um so
 
02:41:05.590 --> 02:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
we have um our community Response Guide
 
02:41:08.429 --> 02:41:08.439 align:start position:0%
was was was was not funded again it was
 
02:41:12.469 --> 02:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
not um it was not appreciated by all
 
02:41:15.269 --> 02:41:15.279 align:start position:0%
members of our um oversight bodies Our
 
02:41:17.750 --> 02:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
communities um and so you know that that
 
02:41:19.269 --> 02:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
was reduced um in the government
 
02:41:20.990 --> 02:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
govern's budget and and I think that's
 
02:41:24.910 --> 02:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
okay um one thing that I can point to
 
02:41:27.469 --> 02:41:27.479 align:start position:0%
though is the that that is kind of a
 
02:41:29.750 --> 02:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
more intense um service that we often
 
02:41:31.510 --> 02:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
see some of these families go to some of
 
02:41:33.790 --> 02:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
our families go to is um our children's
 
02:41:36.230 --> 02:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health System of care which I
 
02:41:38.070 --> 02:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
believe you'll receive a presentation on
 
02:41:41.070 --> 02:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
this tomorrow um through our um division
 
02:41:44.269 --> 02:41:44.279 align:start position:0%
of Behavioral Health and so that is um a
 
02:41:46.389 --> 02:41:46.399 align:start position:0%
way for families to get the help that
 
02:41:48.670 --> 02:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
they need outside of the system could
 
02:41:50.070 --> 02:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
even include include Residential
 
02:41:51.870 --> 02:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
Treatment again as an episode of
 
02:41:54.830 --> 02:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
treatment so we're trying to provide all
 
02:41:57.870 --> 02:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
layers of capacity you know your very
 
02:41:59.790 --> 02:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
basic support in your communities the
 
02:42:01.590 --> 02:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
funding the department does to Family
 
02:42:04.710 --> 02:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
Resource Centers um to a system of care
 
02:42:06.710 --> 02:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
that exists with paid Services
 
02:42:09.309 --> 02:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment outside of DCF for
 
02:42:11.630 --> 02:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
families that really need help and then
 
02:42:13.750 --> 02:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
when you come to DCF this Bast AR Ray of
 
02:42:16.429 --> 02:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
services so we're trying to catch um the
 
02:42:18.750 --> 02:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
various various levels um and I think
 
02:42:21.710 --> 02:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
when I think the work still to be done
 
02:42:23.710 --> 02:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
with communities and and we're going to
 
02:42:26.349 --> 02:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
be a partner here um to do this is is
 
02:42:29.910 --> 02:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
that just that very early on uh work to
 
02:42:32.590 --> 02:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
catch um again I I'm sorry to call out
 
02:42:34.110 --> 02:42:34.120 align:start position:0%
Educators and medical providers but
 
02:42:36.070 --> 02:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
those are the typical people that see
 
02:42:39.190 --> 02:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
kids you know from from preschool you
 
02:42:41.950 --> 02:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
know right up through age 18 and how to
 
02:42:44.670 --> 02:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're communicating
 
02:42:48.110 --> 02:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
enough where those other resources are
 
02:42:50.309 --> 02:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
um so that families do not pick up the
 
02:42:51.670 --> 02:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
phone and we don't have those screen
 
02:42:54.150 --> 02:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
outs that are taking time away um you
 
02:42:55.910 --> 02:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
know from from from calls that could
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
come in um the only thing I'll say about
 
02:42:59.950 --> 02:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
screen outs though is that it it does
 
02:43:01.670 --> 02:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
point to that Community Navigator
 
02:43:05.230 --> 02:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
program um so I I don't want it to
 
02:43:06.750 --> 02:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
appear that those families got nothing
 
02:43:09.510 --> 02:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
from dcyf so we can refer them to that
 
02:43:11.429 --> 02:43:11.439 align:start position:0%
program where the family and the
 
02:43:13.389 --> 02:43:13.399 align:start position:0%
provider get education about what could
 
02:43:15.710 --> 02:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
be available you don't need our service
 
02:43:17.510 --> 02:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
but here's some other things that could
 
02:43:19.269 --> 02:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
be helpful so that that next call
 
02:43:22.429 --> 02:43:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:25.230 --> 02:43:25.240 align:start position:0%

zero in on is the um s SP 463 or right
 
02:45:55.190 --> 02:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
to council for children in the foster
 
02:45:58.269 --> 02:45:58.279 align:start position:0%
care system that was um exclude or
 
02:46:02.349 --> 02:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
postponed in the draft Governor's hb2
 
02:46:04.590 --> 02:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
and I just want to remind this committee
 
02:46:08.830 --> 02:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
that um well first of all um this bill
 
02:46:12.230 --> 02:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
passed on a Voice vote on both the
 
02:46:14.550 --> 02:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
Senate side and the and the house side
 
02:46:16.950 --> 02:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
and it came out of this committee um
 
02:46:19.309 --> 02:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
with a unanimous recommendation ought to
 
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
pass with an
 
02:46:23.349 --> 02:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
amendment and what that Amendment did
 
02:46:25.389 --> 02:46:25.399 align:start position:0%
when it when it was when it passed out
 
02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
of the Senate um there were um 14 cpsw
 
02:46:32.870 --> 02:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
positions in the bill but this committee
 
02:46:35.990 --> 02:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
did not buy that any of those positions
 
02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:36.990 align:start position:0%
did not buy that any of those positions
were

02:46:36.990 --> 02:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:46:40.950 --> 02:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
necessary and so um there was an
 
02:46:43.630 --> 02:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
amendment to the Senate bill that did a
 
02:46:46.830 --> 02:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
couple things um it addressed the um
 
02:46:48.590 --> 02:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
what this committee I think perceived as
 
02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:49.670 align:start position:0%
what this committee I think perceived as
an

02:46:49.670 --> 02:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:46:52.710 --> 02:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
overinflated um request for additional
 
02:46:54.630 --> 02:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
staff and it took out all that staff
 
02:46:57.190 --> 02:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
there were other concerns that had to do
 
02:46:59.389 --> 02:46:59.399 align:start position:0%
with um concerns about whether there
 
02:47:01.469 --> 02:47:01.479 align:start position:0%
would be enough attorneys to represent
 
02:47:03.510 --> 02:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
these children and so the other thing
 
02:47:06.349 --> 02:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
that the amended version ultimately did
 
02:47:08.190 --> 02:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
was establish a phase in schedule
 
02:47:11.070 --> 02:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
because I think there was a concern that
 
02:47:11.080 --> 02:47:11.950 align:start position:0%
because I think there was a concern that
if

02:47:11.950 --> 02:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:47:15.790 --> 02:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
this law became effective on July 1 that
 
02:47:17.190 --> 02:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden there would be around
 
02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
120 children would all be entitled to
 
02:47:22.750 --> 02:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
council at the same time and so the
 
02:47:26.429 --> 02:47:26.439 align:start position:0%
amendment actually included a phas in um
 
02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
by age of child for every three months
 
02:47:33.670 --> 02:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
um so these concerns were addressed this
 
02:47:37.630 --> 02:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
committee met three times um on this
 
02:47:40.429 --> 02:47:40.439 align:start position:0%
particular bill um and had really
 
02:47:41.910 --> 02:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
lengthy discussions some of you are
 
02:47:43.710 --> 02:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
probably having PTSD about it right
 
02:47:45.710 --> 02:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
because you were here there was a lot of
 
02:47:47.389 --> 02:47:47.399 align:start position:0%
discussion there was actually another
 
02:47:49.910 --> 02:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that passed and then didn't
 
02:47:53.070 --> 02:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
and you all spent a lot of time and the
 
02:47:55.389 --> 02:47:55.399 align:start position:0%
reason I think you spent a lot of time
 
02:47:58.389 --> 02:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
um is although you are a I understand
 
02:48:00.190 --> 02:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
you are a fiscal committee or finance
 
02:48:02.590 --> 02:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
committee I think that you are also
 
02:48:04.830 --> 02:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
impressed with the fact that New
 
02:48:07.269 --> 02:48:07.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is an outlier in this country
 
02:48:09.110 --> 02:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
when it comes to representation for
 
02:48:11.469 --> 02:48:11.479 align:start position:0%
Children and Youth who are in the foster
 
02:48:14.910 --> 02:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
care system we guarantee Council for
 
02:48:16.870 --> 02:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
kids in the Juvenile Justice System
 
02:48:19.790 --> 02:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
chins and kids who are in the
 
02:48:22.349 --> 02:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
delinquency system but we are one of
 
02:48:24.710 --> 02:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
only six states in the country that
 
02:48:28.150 --> 02:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
never under any circumstances provide a
 
02:48:30.550 --> 02:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
right to counsel for children who are in
 
02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
the foster care system who I remind you
 
02:48:36.590 --> 02:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
are in the system not because of
 
02:48:38.950 --> 02:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
something that they did in particular
 
02:48:40.429 --> 02:48:40.439 align:start position:0%
which you know lands kids in the
 
02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice System but because
 
02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
their parents allegedly or maybe were
 
02:48:49.550 --> 02:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
proven to have abused or neglected them
 
02:48:53.469 --> 02:48:53.479 align:start position:0%
and um and so that's that made us an
 
02:48:55.309 --> 02:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
outlier and this is something that the
 
02:48:57.110 --> 02:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
committee seemed really committed in the
 
02:49:00.150 --> 02:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
whole house and the whole Senate and our
 
02:49:02.550 --> 02:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
governor thought was important at the
 
02:49:07.469 --> 02:49:07.479 align:start position:0%
time so um that said remembering that
 
02:49:09.870 --> 02:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
I'm in a finance committee something to
 
02:49:11.550 --> 02:49:11.560 align:start position:0%
remember here is that the there there
 
02:49:13.429 --> 02:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
are a couple of financial factors here
 
02:49:16.630 --> 02:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
too one is that as you heard the
 
02:49:19.150 --> 02:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
department has a goal to re reduce its
 
02:49:21.229 --> 02:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
Reliance on residential
 
02:49:24.910 --> 02:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
placement and in doing so if they're
 
02:49:26.910 --> 02:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
successful and I really hope they are
 
02:49:28.469 --> 02:49:28.479 align:start position:0%
that will reduce the number of children
 
02:49:30.269 --> 02:49:30.279 align:start position:0%
who are entitled to counsel right
 
02:49:31.790 --> 02:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
because we will be referring fewer
 
02:49:34.710 --> 02:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
children for residential um Cong when I
 
02:49:36.510 --> 02:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
say residential I'm only talking about
 
02:49:38.110 --> 02:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
residential treatment or congregate
 
02:49:40.269 --> 02:49:40.279 align:start position:0%
settings okay it will reduce the number
 
02:49:41.750 --> 02:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
of children who would then be entitled
 
02:49:44.630 --> 02:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
to councel under this law right because
 
02:49:46.269 --> 02:49:46.279 align:start position:0%
fewer kids who are at risk fewer kids
 
02:49:47.950 --> 02:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
were replaced fewer kids entitled to
 
02:49:50.469 --> 02:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
attorneys the other thing is that some
 
02:49:54.349 --> 02:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
of these kids who have attorneys who are
 
02:49:56.670 --> 02:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
probably expressing their interest to
 
02:50:00.070 --> 02:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
not be taken out of their homes and put
 
02:50:02.510 --> 02:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
in an Institutional kind of setting some
 
02:50:06.190 --> 02:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
of them are going to win right and even
 
02:50:08.790 --> 02:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
if a few of them win that's going to
 
02:50:11.190 --> 02:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
save the state hundreds of thousands
 
02:50:13.349 --> 02:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
probably over a million or millions of
 
02:50:15.710 --> 02:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
dollars because these places are not
 
02:50:17.990 --> 02:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
cheap you know they can be a few
 
02:50:21.030 --> 02:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
hundred, a year for some of them I Lisa
 
02:50:22.630 --> 02:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
would probably know some of them maybe
 
02:50:22.640 --> 02:50:24.070 align:start position:0%
would probably know some of them maybe
more

02:50:24.070 --> 02:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:50:26.830 --> 02:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
so this this does two things right it
 
02:50:29.990 --> 02:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
accomplishes a really important policy
 
02:50:32.910 --> 02:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
matter um and provides a voice for some
 
02:50:34.790 --> 02:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
of our most vulnerable kids who are
 
02:50:37.830 --> 02:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
looking at really you know ter you don't
 
02:50:40.469 --> 02:50:40.479 align:start position:0%
grow up like whatever normal means for a
 
02:50:42.309 --> 02:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
teenager if you are in any kind of
 
02:50:44.110 --> 02:50:44.120 align:start position:0%
institutional setting if you're ripped
 
02:50:45.750 --> 02:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
out of your community your school your
 
02:50:48.030 --> 02:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
friends right so IT addresses that but
 
02:50:50.830 --> 02:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
it also has some potential cost savings
 
02:50:52.870 --> 02:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
and the committee really like I said
 
02:50:55.590 --> 02:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
didn't see the need for all the staff
 
02:50:57.910 --> 02:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
that um the dep department has
 
02:50:57.920 --> 02:51:00.150 align:start position:0%
that um the dep department has
requested

02:51:00.150 --> 02:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
requested
 
02:51:02.309 --> 02:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
so real good thank you for that
 
02:51:04.670 --> 02:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
refresher very helpful in terms of um
 
02:51:07.429 --> 02:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
remembering how this went through
 
02:51:10.670 --> 02:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
anything to add yes please sure the
 
02:51:11.910 --> 02:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
children's Law Center provides
 
02:51:13.990 --> 02:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
representation to children in chins
 
02:51:16.070 --> 02:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
delinquency and abuse and neglect cases
 
02:51:18.590 --> 02:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
so I um actively represent children
 
02:51:21.389 --> 02:51:21.399 align:start position:0%
children who are placed in uh
 
02:51:24.070 --> 02:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
institutional settings um and argue that
 
02:51:25.670 --> 02:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
they be returned to family based
 
02:51:30.349 --> 02:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
settings I am extremely skeptical of um
 
02:51:34.910 --> 02:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
the utility uh the efficacy um and the
 
02:51:37.429 --> 02:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
benefit to Children of institutional
 
02:51:40.309 --> 02:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
placement and you are you are you are
 
02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
right to ask for data on many different
 
02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
things um but but that is one thing I
 
02:51:48.790 --> 02:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
would also seek because we don't don't
 
02:51:51.710 --> 02:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
have outcome data in New Hampshire on
 
02:51:54.990 --> 02:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
the benefits to Children placed in these
 
02:51:57.790 --> 02:51:57.800 align:start position:0%
institutions and as uh one of the
 
02:52:00.229 --> 02:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
representatives mentioned placement out
 
02:52:03.550 --> 02:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
of state we have found to be in fact
 
02:52:06.670 --> 02:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
harmful to children and so these kids
 
02:52:10.429 --> 02:52:10.439 align:start position:0%
need counsel now it is unfortunate that
 
02:52:12.870 --> 02:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire has become so
 
02:52:15.110 --> 02:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
dependent on institutional placement I
 
02:52:17.550 --> 02:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
think it has one of the worst records in
 
02:52:20.469 --> 02:52:20.479 align:start position:0%
the country for sending children uh out
 
02:52:22.910 --> 02:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
of their communities and institutional
 
02:52:25.630 --> 02:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
and into institutional placement um so
 
02:52:27.670 --> 02:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
there's a real human cost to this right
 
02:52:29.910 --> 02:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
it it is not beneficial for children's
 
02:52:33.670 --> 02:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
psychological emotional um developmental
 
02:52:36.830 --> 02:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh development um and if we set up kids
 
02:52:39.070 --> 02:52:39.080 align:start position:0%
up for failure now then there's a cost
 
02:52:41.150 --> 02:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire down the line because
 
02:52:43.510 --> 02:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
these are the kids who will leave
 
02:52:45.950 --> 02:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
institutional care uh without high
 
02:52:48.950 --> 02:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
school diplomas um without job skills
 
02:52:53.070 --> 02:52:53.080 align:start position:0%
and uh at higher risk to um to be
 
02:52:54.910 --> 02:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
involved in the adult criminal legal
 
02:52:58.550 --> 02:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
system which you all know is extremely
 
02:53:02.030 --> 02:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
expensive um the the the uh
 
02:53:05.710 --> 02:53:05.720 align:start position:0%
division has said Miss Newton uh said
 
02:53:09.670 --> 02:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
that it would be Court related work that
 
02:53:14.110 --> 02:53:14.120 align:start position:0%
would require additional uh CPS W time
 
02:53:18.550 --> 02:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
it it is hard for me to see that um the
 
02:53:21.950 --> 02:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
work that the cpsws do now should they
 
02:53:24.510 --> 02:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
should already be doing the work of
 
02:53:28.630 --> 02:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
understanding why a child should be they
 
02:53:30.429 --> 02:53:30.439 align:start position:0%
should know their justification for
 
02:53:33.790 --> 02:53:33.800 align:start position:0%
placing a child in institutional care
 
02:53:36.469 --> 02:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
and and so that work should be done the
 
02:53:38.550 --> 02:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
other thing about the number of hearings
 
02:53:40.030 --> 02:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:53:43.510 --> 02:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
sb47 has essentially spelled out when
 
02:53:45.950 --> 02:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
hearings about institutional placement
 
02:53:49.229 --> 02:53:49.239 align:start position:0%
uh can occur and in fact judges are not
 
02:53:53.389 --> 02:53:53.399 align:start position:0%
required to have hearings they they if a
 
02:53:57.030 --> 02:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
a child's lawyer files a motion asking
 
02:53:59.550 --> 02:53:59.560 align:start position:0%
uh saying to a judge that institutional
 
02:54:03.229 --> 02:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
placement is uh not necessary in the
 
02:54:05.510 --> 02:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
case or won't serve the child the judge
 
02:54:07.269 --> 02:54:07.279 align:start position:0%
does not have to have a hearing on that
 
02:54:09.349 --> 02:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
the judge can simply review the matter
 
02:54:12.590 --> 02:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
so that's RSA 169
 
02:54:15.590 --> 02:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
f84 uh I encourage the the the committee
 
02:54:17.910 --> 02:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
to to take a a look at that so these
 
02:54:17.920 --> 02:54:19.030 align:start position:0%
to to take a a look at that so these
hearing

02:54:19.030 --> 02:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:54:21.349 --> 02:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
will coincide with regular review
 
02:54:22.870 --> 02:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
hearings there may be some additional
 
02:54:25.030 --> 02:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
hearings that is possible I'm not saying
 
02:54:28.150 --> 02:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
that it's not but but I I I do not see
 
02:54:31.229 --> 02:54:31.239 align:start position:0%
how that would require 14 additional
 
02:54:35.110 --> 02:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
cpsw staff even the one per office um
 
02:54:38.070 --> 02:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
that Miss Nunan talked
 
02:54:42.590 --> 02:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
about um I think you know
 
02:54:45.830 --> 02:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
the the other thing to think about as uh
 
02:54:47.710 --> 02:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
as Karen mentioned is the cost of
 
02:54:50.110 --> 02:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
Institution placement you know we send
 
02:54:53.389 --> 02:54:53.399 align:start position:0%
we have a level system from level level
 
02:54:58.070 --> 02:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
two uh which is um very unintensive not
 
02:55:00.510 --> 02:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
restrictive uh residential placement up
 
02:55:03.269 --> 02:55:03.279 align:start position:0%
to level five which is the prtf I just
 
02:55:06.870 --> 02:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
pulled some dollars uh dollar statistics
 
02:55:10.910 --> 02:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
from DCF contracts and uh for a level
 
02:55:13.550 --> 02:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
two placement and and a that that level
 
02:55:16.150 --> 02:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
two child should be served in the
 
02:55:18.950 --> 02:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
community their behavior can be
 
02:55:22.229 --> 02:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
addressed in the community at Spalding
 
02:55:26.510 --> 02:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
um Community uh residential it's
 
02:55:29.190 --> 02:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
$789 a day that's almost
 
02:55:32.710 --> 02:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
$300,000 a year for a single child even
 
02:55:35.510 --> 02:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
with a federal offset of $4 49% you're
 
02:55:38.389 --> 02:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
looking assuming assuming that happens
 
02:55:41.070 --> 02:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
that there is an almost 50% Federal
 
02:55:43.349 --> 02:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
offset you're looking at
 
02:55:46.349 --> 02:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
$141,000 for a single child for a year
 
02:55:48.670 --> 02:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
so lawyers can do two things they can
 
02:55:50.389 --> 02:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
keep children out of residential
 
02:55:54.429 --> 02:55:54.439 align:start position:0%
placement as Karen um remarked and then
 
02:55:56.150 --> 02:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
if a child is sent to residential
 
02:55:58.670 --> 02:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
placement they can get them home sooner
 
02:56:01.550 --> 02:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
or get them Ste down into less expensive
 
02:56:04.710 --> 02:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
care in a family based setting
 
02:56:06.590 --> 02:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
sooner thank you very much for that
 
02:56:09.630 --> 02:56:09.640 align:start position:0%
information any questions for our guests
 
02:56:11.229 --> 02:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:56:13.910 --> 02:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
noveno yeah if I if I hear what you're
 
02:56:16.910 --> 02:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
saying I you know and and maybe rephrase
 
02:56:19.630 --> 02:56:19.640 align:start position:0%
this because I stood Miss nunan's
 
02:56:23.110 --> 02:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
presentation to say the focus was on
 
02:56:26.710 --> 02:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
directionally reducing the out of uh you
 
02:56:29.150 --> 02:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
know the institutional placement which I
 
02:56:31.750 --> 02:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
think is consistent uh with what you're
 
02:56:36.150 --> 02:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
saying and so uh what else uh could
 
02:56:42.830 --> 02:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
could be done to you know um uh kind of
 
02:56:44.870 --> 02:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh augment that effort that already
 
02:56:47.429 --> 02:56:47.439 align:start position:0%
exists you know the everybody realizes
 
02:56:51.110 --> 02:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
the costs and and and I would agree with
 
02:56:52.790 --> 02:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
the sentiment that
 
02:56:57.429 --> 02:56:57.439 align:start position:0%
probably uh has some detrimental aspects
 
02:56:59.550 --> 02:56:59.560 align:start position:0%
uh to it for a lot of lot of different
 
02:57:02.710 --> 02:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
reasons not to go into them but what uh
 
02:57:06.229 --> 02:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
would you suggest that uh DCF ought to
 
02:57:06.239 --> 02:57:07.110 align:start position:0%
would you suggest that uh DCF ought to
be

02:57:07.110 --> 02:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:57:12.429 --> 02:57:12.439 align:start position:0%
doing uh to kind of uh okay help with
 
02:57:15.870 --> 02:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:18.550 --> 02:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
objectives yes well investment in the
 
02:57:20.910 --> 02:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
children's system of care and the
 
02:57:23.349 --> 02:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
problem is that that this state is so
 
02:57:25.670 --> 02:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
stuck so addicted to residential
 
02:57:28.229 --> 02:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
placement and so committed to funding it
 
02:57:30.670 --> 02:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
I mean I think um there the
 
02:57:33.790 --> 02:57:33.800 align:start position:0%
DCF asked presented a contract to the
 
02:57:36.510 --> 02:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
executive Council in June or July of
 
02:57:40.150 --> 02:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
2024 um that sought approval of $365
 
02:57:42.950 --> 02:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
million for a two-year period right and
 
02:57:44.910 --> 02:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
probably some federal offset there it's
 
02:57:49.110 --> 02:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
a huge price tag for around 300 50 kids
 
02:57:51.550 --> 02:57:51.560 align:start position:0%
at any point in time maybe 4 to 500 a
 
02:57:54.389 --> 02:57:54.399 align:start position:0%
year and so unless we take that money
 
02:57:58.070 --> 02:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
now um and invest it in foster care in
 
02:58:00.910 --> 02:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
ISO foster care so Therapeutic Foster
 
02:58:03.229 --> 02:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
Care um invested in other community-
 
02:58:05.590 --> 02:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
Based Services we support intercept for
 
02:58:07.630 --> 02:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
example which is a Youth Villages
 
02:58:11.150 --> 02:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
services that dcyf seeks funding again
 
02:58:13.510 --> 02:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
for this year uh we support the funding
 
02:58:17.070 --> 02:58:17.080 align:start position:0%
of um of CMEs uh Care Management
 
02:58:19.269 --> 02:58:19.279 align:start position:0%
entities which is is uh something that
 
02:58:21.990 --> 02:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
135f the children's system of care
 
02:58:25.790 --> 02:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
called for several years ago um but that
 
02:58:28.510 --> 02:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
money you you can't keep
 
02:58:33.389 --> 02:58:33.399 align:start position:0%
funding the obscenely high price tag of
 
02:58:33.399 --> 02:58:36.269 align:start position:0%
funding the obscenely high price tag of
institutional

02:58:36.269 --> 02:58:36.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:38.950 --> 02:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
care yeah I just make the comment I mean
 
02:58:41.070 --> 02:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
I'm as I said I'm a relatively new
 
02:58:44.830 --> 02:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
legislature not new to a lot of the
 
02:58:47.389 --> 02:58:47.399 align:start position:0%
related issues on this and I would say
 
02:58:49.870 --> 02:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
that uh I think we're all on the same
 
02:58:52.670 --> 02:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
page uh it's just a question of you know
 
02:58:55.150 --> 02:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
how do we and and I don't know whether
 
02:58:57.550 --> 02:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
you know how to take this the fact that
 
02:59:01.950 --> 02:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
I'm addicted to uh making the most cost
 
02:59:05.349 --> 02:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
effective uh decisions on providing the
 
02:59:07.790 --> 02:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
best services and so that's what I'm
 
02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
addicted to from the financial
 
02:59:11.349 --> 02:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
standpoint and so the question is how
 
02:59:13.269 --> 02:59:13.279 align:start position:0%
can if we're all on the same page then
 
02:59:15.150 --> 02:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
all we're talking about is what's the
 
02:59:17.830 --> 02:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
best means of achieving uh the goals
 
02:59:21.710 --> 02:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
that satisfy the the basic remit of uh
 
02:59:23.030 --> 02:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh what we're doing here in health and
 
02:59:26.070 --> 02:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
human services and and do it in the most
 
02:59:29.070 --> 02:59:29.080 align:start position:0%
cost effective way so anyhow thanks uh
 
02:59:31.830 --> 02:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
thanks for your input thank you
 
02:59:33.830 --> 02:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative tarki I was just going to
 
02:59:37.229 --> 02:59:37.239 align:start position:0%
ask um when we are going to be
 
02:59:39.590 --> 02:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
discussing the system of care and these
 
02:59:42.070 --> 02:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
prevention um services so that we can
 
02:59:44.590 --> 02:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
really dig into the topic excellent
 
02:59:45.910 --> 02:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
question in fact I was just pulling out
 
02:59:48.269 --> 02:59:48.279 align:start position:0%
my schedule I believe that is is
 
02:59:51.110 --> 02:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative oh excuse me Mr
 
02:59:54.229 --> 02:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
Ripple so get the Bureau of Behavioral
 
02:59:56.750 --> 02:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
Health tomorrow um so it would be part
 
02:59:57.670 --> 02:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
of that
 
03:00:01.670 --> 03:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
conversation okay as early as
 
03:00:04.030 --> 03:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow another consideration in terms
 
03:00:06.110 --> 03:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
of the financial investment that the
 
03:00:07.990 --> 03:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
state is making in residential cares I
 
03:00:11.510 --> 03:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
think you heard earlier that um we're
 
03:00:14.550 --> 03:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
currently the state is able to collect
 
03:00:17.030 --> 03:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
Federal matching funds Medicaid funds
 
03:00:20.269 --> 03:00:20.279 align:start position:0%
for facility that they're called IMDB's
 
03:00:21.950 --> 03:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
institutions for mental disease I hate
 
03:00:24.110 --> 03:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
that name but anyway that serve more
 
03:00:26.790 --> 03:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
than 16 children but that's under a a
 
03:00:30.110 --> 03:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
kind of Tim limited waiver that the
 
03:00:33.429 --> 03:00:33.439 align:start position:0%
state was able to obtain from CMS and
 
03:00:37.469 --> 03:00:37.479 align:start position:0%
that is going to expire so um so for in
 
03:00:39.349 --> 03:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
terms of like the amount that the state
 
03:00:41.670 --> 03:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
is investing in residential treatment
 
03:00:43.630 --> 03:00:43.640 align:start position:0%
for children who are at these larger
 
03:00:46.309 --> 03:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
facilities the federal match at least
 
03:00:48.710 --> 03:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid match is not going to be
 
03:00:51.190 --> 03:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
available um and I think the department
 
03:00:52.790 --> 03:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
will know exactly what the timeline is
 
03:00:54.269 --> 03:00:54.279 align:start position:0%
and I think that's included in the
 
03:00:55.870 --> 03:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
budget and explains some of the
 
03:00:57.910 --> 03:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
difference and why the federal
 
03:00:59.670 --> 03:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursement went down because that
 
03:01:03.150 --> 03:01:03.160 align:start position:0%
will not be available but Medicaid does
 
03:01:06.510 --> 03:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
pay for community- based medical
 
03:01:10.670 --> 03:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:13.830 --> 03:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
therapy anything further from the
 
03:01:16.229 --> 03:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
committee thank you both very much thank
 
03:01:21.630 --> 03:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:25.110 --> 03:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
anything further from those here from
 
03:01:25.120 --> 03:01:26.630 align:start position:0%
anything further from those here from
the

03:01:26.630 --> 03:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:01:30.510 --> 03:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
public all right with that then we will
 
03:01:33.070 --> 03:01:33.080 align:start position:0%
start to wind down our work session
 
03:01:34.550 --> 03:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
precisely 4
 
03:01:37.030 --> 03:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
o'clock a reminder we're back here
