00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
we're being trying to be extra careful
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
on sound this time we had a little
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
problem sport i think representative
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
mcguire is just suggesting we might be
 
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
able to use it to pick
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
to spread it more evenly in front of the
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
all right terrific um before we begin um
 
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.589 align:start position:0%
all right terrific um before we begin um
i'm

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
going to ask uh representative mcdonald
 
00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
to take attendance and uh this committee
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet very frequently and we
 
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
haven't met recently so this is also a
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
way for us to all say good morning to
 
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
each other by remembering who we are
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
mcdonald if you could take the roll call
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
for attendance thank you madam chairman

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for doing that um
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
the first uh item that is
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
going to be mentioned is that since we
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
met the census data has been released i
 
00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
think when we met we anticipated it was
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
going to be released on a monday it was
 
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
actually released the thursday before
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
that information has been
 
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
put on the new hampshire
 
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
website the new hampshire government
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
website if you go to the
 
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
committee on redistricting site through
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
the house of representatives there is a
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
icon for census data if you click on
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
that it takes you to another length
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
nothing is simple no matter what they
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
tell you and you click on that and that
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
will take you to the osi government red
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
page which has the census data that
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
census data there is compiled with
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
county numbers and community numbers and
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk a little bit later
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
about those numbers
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
but if you can if you're interested in
 
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
seeing those numbers that's where you
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
should go to see them if you try to do
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
it through the census webpage quite
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
frankly it's an exercise in frustration
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
and when they have multiple videos to
 
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
tell you how to use their own web page
 
00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
you know you're in trouble so i would
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
suggest that you go to the website
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
through our
 
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
website at the location through our
 
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
website to take a look at it um in
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
regards to the the numbers that are on
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
there committee members have been
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
provided with uh this morning
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
and an email sent late last night i
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
apologize to committee members uh the
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
county population data that has been
 
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.670 align:start position:0%
county population data that has been
released

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
released
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
this is important for this committee
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
because our work is really focused on
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
the county breakout of population
 
00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:25.110 align:start position:0%
the county breakout of population
and

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
it shows this is to allocate the number
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
of representatives
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
of 400 per population
 
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
which works out to 3
 
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.910 align:start position:0%
which works out to 3
43.8225

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
as to persons per rep
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
and i expect that we're going to have
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
some discussion on grounding because
 
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839 align:start position:0%
this is actually a math exercise
 
00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:55.190 align:start position:0%
this is actually a math exercise
and

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to see i think when we go
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
through data that the math matters
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
so what you have in front of you is the
 
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
2020 county population which works out
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
to our state total of 1
 
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.430 align:start position:0%
to our state total of 1
377

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
377
 
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.069 align:start position:0%
377
529

00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
529
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
and as a percentage of the state
 
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.230 align:start position:0%
and as a percentage of the state
population

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
not a surprise hillsborough is the
 
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.910 align:start position:0%
not a surprise hillsborough is the
largest

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
largest
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
and the smallest for population is
 
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.110 align:start position:0%
and the smallest for population is
co-ops

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
co-ops
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
there is also a column on the county
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
as to that that the committee is looking
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
at as to what would be the perfect
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
persons per rep and what that would work
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
out to be
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
then there is a rounded number on the
 
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.710 align:start position:0%
then there is a rounded number on the
committee

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.230 align:start position:0%

worksheet

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
worksheet
 
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.190 align:start position:0%
worksheet
and

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
that totals the 400 representatives
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
which works out to an allocation for
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
example of hillsborough of 123
 
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.069 align:start position:0%
example of hillsborough of 123
and

00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
coast again the lowest county of nine
 
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.389 align:start position:0%
coast again the lowest county of nine
reps

00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
reps
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
and just for a minute representative um
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
ross he was you were sort of uh
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
rounding work
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
can you take a quick look at this and
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
tell me sort of how many decimal points
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
i press the button yeah yeah um is that
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
better yes
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
so it's taken out on the sheet it's
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
taken out to 10 decimal points and it
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
uses a strict rounding so um point you
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
know 1.49 is not two 1.49 is one
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's i took it out to the
 
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
point where it was insignificant for the
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
purposes of rounding um actually it's
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
well beyond that i think i only need to
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
go out um i think four or five in some
 
00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.550 align:start position:0%
go out um i think four or five in some
cases

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
but it's it's to show all the math so
 
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's as transparent as possible
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
and the last column on the sheet that
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
we're reviewing compares the
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
rounded allocation to what is currently
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
the location and again this is math and
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
for purposes of discussion
 
00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
later um it shows that
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
cheshire koas and grafton
 
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
would be losing a rep under the current
 
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
allocation and hillsborough rockingham
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
and stratford would be gaining a wrap
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
and that is somewhat consistent with
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
what you've heard
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
publicly in articles that i've seen
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
published is that the population seems
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
to have shifted south and to the east
 
00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:00.230 align:start position:0%
to have shifted south and to the east
so

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
those numbers are available on
 
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.470 align:start position:0%
those numbers are available on
support

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
yep representative smith
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
i wish my grandson was here because he
 
00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
let me skip and i'll come back when i
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
have the question more organized all
 
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
right we're going to come back to this
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
later i wanted to lay this out because
 
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
of course the foundation for anything we
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
do is numbers
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
um and anything we do has to do with
 
00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.269 align:start position:0%
um and anything we do has to do with
maps

00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
maps
 
00:14:57.279 --> 00:14:58.710 align:start position:0%
maps
and

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
we have with us this morning is we have
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
with us this morning joel anderson
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
joel anderson is a former 30 some odd
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
year employee
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
he retired earlier this year thank you
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
for joining us joe joel
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
worked with the house 10 years ago when
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
developing the software that was used
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
for the mapping program
 
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.069 align:start position:0%
for the mapping program
and

00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
joel came in
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
last month
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
to do a demonstration
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
um here as to the software as to how it
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
would work
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
and the decision has been made for for
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
us to proceed with using this software
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
which allows us to deal with the
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
floatarial issue that's provided for in
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
our constitution and that we need to do
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
it uses the method the same method of
 
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
math as a component method as compared
 
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
to another method that had been used
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
a couple of decades ago and can't be
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
used anymore
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
and i want to thank joel for
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
agreeing to come back as a part-time
 
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
employee of
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to be part-time i don't know
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
that it's been part-time the last few
 
00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:09.509 align:start position:0%
that it's been part-time the last few
days

00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
of the general court and
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
he is here to give us a demonstration
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
and we are also going to talk about
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
these thumb drives that you all have at
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
the end of the presentation so welcome
 
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.230 align:start position:0%
the end of the presentation so welcome
joel

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
uh glad to be here um
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
looking forward to serving the the
 
00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:31.189 align:start position:0%
looking forward to serving the the
committee

00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
and helping them with this
 
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.389 align:start position:0%
and helping them with this
this

00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
mapping tool that you could use to draw
 
00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:37.590 align:start position:0%
mapping tool that you could use to draw
maps

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
maps
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
but you can use the
 
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.230 align:start position:0%
but you can use the
question

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it's there for
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
amplification do you have the red button
 
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.710 align:start position:0%
amplification do you have the red button
impressed

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
impressed
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i do and if it becomes a problem
 
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.910 align:start position:0%
yeah i do and if it becomes a problem
um

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
okay there we go let's get it out of
 
00:16:55.519 --> 00:16:56.550 align:start position:0%
okay there we go let's get it out of
track

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
track
 
00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.749 align:start position:0%
track
um

00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
you you've already heard a little
 
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
history let me interrupt you i'm gonna
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
request that the doors not be blocked
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of room on the other side
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
of the room for people to stand if they
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
want to take pictures um there is a
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
tripod with the camera set up in in
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
front of one half of the door so i'm
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
going to ask the gentleman in front of
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
the other half to please move i want the
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
entrances to the room uh kept open thank
 
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.189 align:start position:0%
entrances to the room uh kept open thank
you

00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
sorry for the interruption no problem no
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
problem um
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
so the just a quick history on on this
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
software it's um it was developed by me
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
10 years ago because we didn't have any
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
software at the time
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
to do our mapping
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
there weren't any commercial products
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
available that new hampshire could use
 
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that we have
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
materials and that's a rare thing
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
maybe not used by any other state i
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
think there may be a few localities that
 
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
use it now and then but
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
anyway um in terms of commercial
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
software wasn't available so i um i
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
decided i thought that i might be able
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
to uh develop some
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
some software that could do it for us
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
and um so i did some preliminary work on
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
it looked like it would work and um so i
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
went and went
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
ahead and developed the whole thing
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
um i'm not a professional programmer
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
just so you all know i just kind of
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
picked it up on myself on my own
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
and uh so
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
i do well enough but there's a lot of
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
technicalities that i may not be
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
that knowledgeable about
 
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.350 align:start position:0%
that knowledgeable about
um

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.150 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
why don't we go ahead
 
00:18:33.919 --> 00:18:35.990 align:start position:0%
why don't we go ahead
and

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
start up the software
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
so that you can see it
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
i should be
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
looks like the post disabled participant
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:06.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
okay well let's see it
 
00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
can't share my screen right now via zoom
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
so i can just do you want me to just go
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.960 --> 00:20:24.710 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
great question so
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
every everybody hates fliterials but
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
they're a mathematical necessity to
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
comply with the federal one-man one-vote
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
rule where we have to have districts as
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
close to perfect population as we can
 
00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:04.950 align:start position:0%
close to perfect population as we can
get

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
but new hampshire being unique that we
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
have so many little pieces to put
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
together and we can't cross county lines
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
it isn't always possible to put towns
 
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
together for multi-seat districts that
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
are perfect so the overage goes into the
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
materials there's just no other way to
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
do it here to get it all to work out so
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
you um
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
a couple of things about the software in
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
the meantime um
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
uh when is there there's some discussion
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
both of you were speaking about the uh
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
both of you were speaking about the
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
number of um
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
of what the ideal population is for
 
00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:45.350 align:start position:0%
of what the ideal population is for
representatives

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:47.799 align:start position:0%
that number of
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
343.8 something something whatever
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
so just so you know that the the
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
software uses that fractional number so
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
it uses the exact amount it doesn't do
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
any rounding in it
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
in terms of doing all the computations
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
so that makes a minor difference you
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
know when you when you do the
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
computations if instead of using a whole
 
00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:10.870 align:start position:0%
computations if instead of using a whole
number

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is is basically
 
00:23:13.679 --> 00:23:15.830 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is is basically
um

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.029 align:start position:0%
um
statistics

00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
00:23:17.039 --> 00:23:18.630 align:start position:0%
statistics
generally

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
generally
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
in statistics generally it's i think
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
it's good you're going to do any
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
rounding to do the rounding at the end
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
of all your
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
computations rather than do some kind of
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
rounding in the middle of your
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
computations so
 
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
so that's where the the software works
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
it uses the exact number for ideal
 
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.390 align:start position:0%
it uses the exact number for ideal
population

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh the software also
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
um in terms of
 
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.190 align:start position:0%
um in terms of
what's

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
what's
 
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
considered contiguous
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
um and that's a requirement of the
 
00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
constitution you're going to put two
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
talents together they have to be
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
contiguous for purposes of this software
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
and it can be changed but the way it's
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
set up is that
 
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh two towns that come together at a
 
00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.870 align:start position:0%
uh two towns that come together at a
point

00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
are considered contiguous
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
last year's um map
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
they are the current redistricting we
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
use that in one place in stratford
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
county there are two towns that come
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
together at a point and they were made
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
things to keep in mind that can be
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
oh so
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
so it's is it it's working now okay i
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
don't have to do anything sorry
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
while joe's clicking i'm reminded that
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
the live stream needs us to be pressing
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
the button and to be closer to the mic
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
when we speak so
 
00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:09.510 align:start position:0%
when we speak so
help

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
so this is when you start up the
 
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
software and i should say this soft
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing here
 
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
we're supposedly being good with
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
ah there we go
 
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.350 align:start position:0%
ah there we go
excellent

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
okay um first off i just want to say
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
that what you're seeing here is
 
00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:27.990 align:start position:0%
that what you're seeing here is
basically

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
the setup that
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
software as it looked 10 years ago
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
when you uh
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
there's just a mine a couple of minor
 
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.830 align:start position:0%
there's just a mine a couple of minor
changes

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
the the software that that you have
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
um that you'll be loading on
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
will look just a slightly different than
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
this in terms of the the buttons at the
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
very top
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
and just other just minor changes but
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
for the most part when you load it up
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's going to look like this
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
um okay so this is the when you when you
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
start up the software the first thing
 
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
you get is a cover page and um
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
you'll see it says house redistricting
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
so it says house redistricting you can
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
type in this area whatever you would
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
like to it's your plan
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
so you could you know if you want to put
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
any notes or whatever concerning your
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
plan you can type it in here and it will
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
be saved
 
00:27:26.399 --> 00:27:27.350 align:start position:0%
be saved
um

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
so there's a series of tabs
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
going along i don't know if you can see
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
my cursor well enough but there's a
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
series of tabs for all the county names
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
so if i um
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go just to
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
sullivan county
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
and so it this brings up the
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
the map of sullivan
 
00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:52.710 align:start position:0%
the map of sullivan
and

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.230 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to go through
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
with you know how you you go about
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
making a
 
00:27:58.559 --> 00:27:59.830 align:start position:0%
making a
um

00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
district how you do a map i'm just going
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
to take a look at claremont down here
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
claremont you see has three different
 
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:08.950 align:start position:0%
claremont you see has three different
wards

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
wards
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
they're all about the same same size
 
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
for back in 2010 the ideal population
 
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:18.039 align:start position:0%
was um
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
3291 and so you can see each one of
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
these wards is is large enough to have
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
its own seat
 
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
so we we can go ahead and
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
start creating districts um
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
by you by clicking on the label and say
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
create a district so this software is
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
all basically label based
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of how you operate so you click
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
on a label you're given options as to
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
what you can do at that point sometimes
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
it restricts what you can do
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
because um
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
decide that i want to put playing field
 
00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:56.149 align:start position:0%
decide that i want to put playing field
with

00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
claremont because they're not contiguous
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
so like it won't allow you to put you
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
know non-contiguous towns together into
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
the district so it has certain rules
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
so here we um we have
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
ward 3 that we put into a district the
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
label here it's probably pretty small i
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
don't know if you can see it or not but
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
it says um it's labeled as district one
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
it has one seat
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
it tells you what the population of
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
of the town is and i should have said
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
that earlier on all of these labels
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
these town labels tell you what the
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.510 align:start position:0%
and um
so

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
so you so you're given this information
 
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
from the label this is now a district
 
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.389 align:start position:0%
from the label this is now a district
label

00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
label
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's ordered in uh
 
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.190 align:start position:0%
it's it's ordered in uh
gold

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
gold
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
so that means it's a district label
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
it's uh colored in claremont um
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
ward three you know in blue so you know
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
that's a district
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
um and then also down below it'll it'll
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
show you
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh two other numbers it says um
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
says uh you know the overall population
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
of ward three is 4260
 
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
this numbered below at 976
 
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
means those are the the
 
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
um that if you took 4 267 and subtracted
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
off the ideal population
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
of 3291 you would get this number 976.
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
that basically tells you that's how many
 
00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:26.230 align:start position:0%
that basically tells you that's how many
more

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh that's how many people aren't really
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
being represented
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
in that board so you need to add
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
they this this district needs more
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
representation basically one seat
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't do this okay you gotta get more
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
um so and then after that you'll get a
 
00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:46.710 align:start position:0%
um so and then after that you'll get a
uh

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
percent deviation
 
00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.029 align:start position:0%
percent deviation
29.6

00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
29.6
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
and what that's the the the deviation
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be working with
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's the primary number that you're
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
always going to look at and see whether
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
or not it's a deviation that's
 
00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.029 align:start position:0%
or not it's a deviation that's
acceptable

00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.070 align:start position:0%
in the past
um

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
we've used plus or minus five percent
 
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.190 align:start position:0%
we've used plus or minus five percent
basically

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
the court's my understanding is that
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
that's if that's a an acceptable
 
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919 align:start position:0%
uh deviation to stay within if you go
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
outside of that then you're going to
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
have to answer why you went outside of
 
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:21.990 align:start position:0%
have to answer why you went outside of
that

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
to the courts
 
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.430 align:start position:0%
to the courts
so

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
so you can um
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
so basically you're trying to stay plus
 
00:31:30.549 --> 00:31:30.559 align:start position:0%
or minus 5
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
so we're at 29.6
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
right now so we're gonna have to do
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
something else with with ward 3.
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go ahead and work with the
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
other wards
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
and um in claremont you'll see that they
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
they all have similar populations
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
claremont we did their ward line so that
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
they would their wards would be
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
basically of the same population that's
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
what cities generally do
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
um you know after the census numbers
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
come out so we're expecting that many
 
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
cities will be
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
redrawing word lines in the next few
 
00:32:00.799 --> 00:32:02.389 align:start position:0%
redrawing word lines in the next few
months

00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:32:02.399 --> 00:32:03.350 align:start position:0%
months
so

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
excuse me um
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to turn ward one
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
into a district you can see i have an
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
option i can create a district or i
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
could join ward one with world war three
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
to one district
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
but i'm not doing that i'm just creating
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
another district
 
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
you'll see similar numbers here for ward
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
one because its population is similar to
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
ward three
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
um i'm gonna make ward two into a
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
district so now we have three districts
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
in claremont
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
they all are in need of more
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
representation in new hampshire we have
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
flow tarials to take care of that
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
we'll just make
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
form them into one material you know
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
floaterial is just
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
you're probably familiar with this
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
material it's just composed of of
 
00:32:50.159 --> 00:32:51.350 align:start position:0%
material it's just composed of of
underlying

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
underlying
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh regulator districts that are all
 
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
combined together and this of floater is
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
kind of an overlay district
 
00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.029 align:start position:0%
kind of an overlay district
so

00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
we'll make a floaterial here
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
so i can create a float now a floaterial
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
this this this black label here
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
material label
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
it's given a district number it has one
 
00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.590 align:start position:0%
it's given a district number it has one
seat

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
seat
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
um and then it has a number here that
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
gives you the
 
00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.269 align:start position:0%
gives you the
um

00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
the total population of the flow now and
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
actually it's its population
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
right now is the same as war three so
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
it's what it will do is total up the
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
total population within the flow terial
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's what that number will tell you
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
the number below that you don't need to
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
worry about that one too much it's just
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
kind of a it's a number you can
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
kind of look at to see well
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
districts can i put in
 
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
that will fit within the floater by
 
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of how much how much more
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
population those other districts need so
 
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
they got 2 315 more
 
00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.149 align:start position:0%
they got 2 315 more
extra

00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
extra
 
00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
populations population folks that could
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
go into that district so
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to take ward one and join
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
that in with with the new floaterial
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
so i have an option of joining the float
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm going to do join the
 
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.230 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm going to do join the
float

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
float
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
this software just so you know if you
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
try and go ahead and
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
say create another district someplace up
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
here like a cornish it won't let you do
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
that because floaterials always have to
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
have more than one member
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
district underlying it so it's going to
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
say next thing you have to do is you
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
have to add a district to the floater
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
so i'm adding board one
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna join that
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
and i'm gonna join in ward two gonna
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
join that float
 
00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:46.950 align:start position:0%
join that float
okay

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
then you can rearrange these labels
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
however you want to move them around
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
wherever you need to move them you know
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes they get on top of each other
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
so you can just move them so you can see
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
things as well
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
so now what you'll see is that the
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
if you look at the deviations
 
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.829 align:start position:0%
if you look at the deviations
for

00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
that show
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
they they're going to show only in the
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
regular districts you don't get a
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
deviation for the entire floateral you
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
get it for each one of the separate
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
districts that's kind of part of the
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
component method
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
is that's that's where the the uh
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's the level at which the deviations
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
are calculated
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
basically that that one seed in the flow
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
material has been divided out amongst
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
the three underlying districts based
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
upon the population of each one of those
 
00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.670 align:start position:0%
upon the population of each one of those
districts

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.310 align:start position:0%
districts
so

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
and now you'll see that you look at the
 
00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:43.839 align:start position:0%
deviation of
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
one two and three they're all
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh within that that five percent some
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
two of them are above it or two and ward
 
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.910 align:start position:0%
two of them are above it or two and ward
one

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
and ward three is um just below negative
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
one point seven percent so basically if
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
you see a if you see a deviation that
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
that's over
 
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.349 align:start position:0%
that's over
um

00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
the uh over zero it's a positive number
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
number that means basically
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
you're you're you
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
you uh it could actually use a few more
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
um a little bit more representation
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
but um it's sort of hard to give just a
 
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
little bit more you know once you get
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
that close especially with it within a
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable deviation so that's where you
 
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.310 align:start position:0%
reasonable deviation so that's where you
stop

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
stop
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
um i award like word three that's a
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
negative number that means it got a
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
more representation than it needed but
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's okay because it's within that
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
five percent
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
so there you go that's basically um
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
how you go about making
 
00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:44.079 align:start position:0%
districts and materials and and what i
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
can do
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
i could just also
 
00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.910 align:start position:0%
i could just also
um

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
fill in the rest what i'm planning on
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
doing is is filling in the the rest of
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
sullivan county um
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
with actually what the present map is
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
for sullivan county
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
so you can just see how
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
different districts can go together in
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
different sizes and number and how they
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
can go together and flow
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question here so
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
again in my ignorance
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
claremont is a city and has rewards are
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
we required to acknowledge those wards
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
when we redistrict
 
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.109 align:start position:0%
when we redistrict
one

00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
two if there weren't enough people
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
would we be able to pull people from a
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
surrounding town
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
to make up the number
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
yeah in terms of the and one last thing
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
about getting a message from someone
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
who's watching on youtube and they
 
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
cannot hear on youtube
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
they cannot see an app
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
showing this on youtube was not uh did
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
not make it on the list of priorities so
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that it
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
is occurring
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
um we wanted to make sure the committee
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
and that it was
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
here and again i'm asking everybody to
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
try and
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
speak a little louder
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know that you can pull the
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
microphone any closer than it is so
 
00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.550 align:start position:0%
microphone any closer than it is so
oh

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh so in terms of the question so the
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
question is as to recognition of wards
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
if you want to take that and the ability
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
to add
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so in terms of um yeah i mean the
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
the awards of a city
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
are are recognized you know when it
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
i think pretty much you if a city has
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
words then
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
um i think there's an obligation if
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
they're true true
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
of the city then there's an obligation
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
to recognize them they are recognized in
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
the software
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
um there's though though doesn't mean
 
00:39:22.079 --> 00:39:23.030 align:start position:0%
um there's though though doesn't mean
that

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
you can't lump them all together
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
that happened in lebanon last time
 
00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:27.750 align:start position:0%
that happened in lebanon last time
around

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
all three wards were put together into
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
one ward
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
i mean into into one district and and
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
that was due partly because of the
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
just the uh difficulty they're down in
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
the corner of the county they had kind
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
of strange uh population numbers for
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
their awards and they kind of had to be
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
all put together
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
um it's it's also possible to yeah
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
wards under the software
 
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
um and and just in redistricting in
 
00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.190 align:start position:0%
um and and just in redistricting in
general

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing that limits them in
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
terms of what they can be combined with
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
so that you can certainly combine them
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
with with towns outside and that
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
happened with uh conquer i think
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
hopkinton and ward something else
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
were put into a district of its own
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh thank you
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
joel for the presentation
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh i have two quick questions um i
 
00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
assume that the database is loaded with
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
the census data after the cities have
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
done their redistricting there will be
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
new population numbers for the wards can
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
those new population numbers then be
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
added to your database to replace the
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
census numbers
 
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:44.230 align:start position:0%
census numbers
yeah

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
and the second question if i may
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh joel you mentioned that the software
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
tries to ensure that when you're
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
creating floaterials that the
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
territories are contiguous
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
some years ago
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
there was a floaterial created that
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
included the town of merrimack and the
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
town of litchfield
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
which geographically is contiguous but
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
there's no way from the people in
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
merrimack to get to litchfield
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
because there's no bridge in the
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
merrimack river separates the two
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
does your software take into
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
consideration those natural boundaries
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
or barriers uh when looking at adjoining
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
communities to see if they're truly
 
00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.270 align:start position:0%
communities to see if they're truly
contiguous

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
contiguous
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
truly contiguous would be a matter of
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
definition i think joel um i believe it
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
does not is that correct
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's right um in terms of highways or
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
bodies of water that type of thing
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
that's standard for the government in
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
this required federal standard as to
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
population and representation
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.829 align:start position:0%
so thank you
thank

00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:46.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
you okay so you want to do a couple more
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
in sullivan county sullivan county sure
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
so here's um gonna go to charlestown
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
and um so it's got a population of five
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
thousand one hundred and fourteen so we
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
can use a seat so we're gonna give it a
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
seat and then then you'll see all these
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
um some smaller towns down in the the
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
southern tier
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
and none of them can can
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
have a seat of their own so they're
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
going to need to be combined together in
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
order to
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
have a sufficient population to to
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
deserve at least one seat
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to create another
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
district of langdon and backworth we're
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
going to join in you'll see when you
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
when you can join into a district you're
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes given an option as to which
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
district you want to go into if the town
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
is next to two districts
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
so back with is next to charlestown and
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
also langdon so you get a choice but by
 
00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:37.910 align:start position:0%
also langdon so you get a choice but by
color

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
color
 
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna go we're gonna stay with
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
yellow here
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna keep going with yellow and
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
just keep combining these together
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
um let's say here you're at a point
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
where um
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
we're we're up to a point where
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
we've gone over the total population
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
this district is is above the ideal
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
population so we could stop here and say
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
okay we got it big enough okay but then
 
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to say well actually though
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
these th is not within plus or minus
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
five percent so so how are we going to
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
settle that well you form a flow
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
material if you can't of course and so
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
we could say well let's see let's try
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
to put uh the blue district together
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
with the yellow district so that's
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
charlestown so we could create a float
 
00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.190 align:start position:0%
charlestown so we could create a float
there

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to join in this
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
other new district to that
 
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
and um so and we can then it shows you
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
what the the resulting deviations are
 
00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
well it if you look at the charlestown
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
number it's negative one point
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
negative one percent deviation so that's
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
fine if you look at the the yellow
 
00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.150 align:start position:0%
fine if you look at the the yellow
district

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
uh it's the deviation is negative 18.1
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
not so good so that that didn't work
 
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.109 align:start position:0%
not so good so that that didn't work
okay

00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
so one way to fix that would be you can
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
see that there's there's a little bit
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
the yellow district has
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
um is a little over represented so if we
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
put some more people into that that
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
yellow district perhaps the float work
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
so what i'm going to do is just add i'm
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
going to delete this flow terial for now
 
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to add in
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
um goshen
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
to increase the population a little bit
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
now it's a higher population and so now
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
the deviation works out at this point
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
two percent two percent for the uh the
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
blue region or the purplish region
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
and uh negative four percent for the
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
yellow so it succeeded that's good
 
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
so it's a good thing because this is
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
what the map was last time around so you
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
know if it didn't work out we were in
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
big trouble here
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
now okay so then you go on to
 
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
you could say okay um
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
we can make newport into a district
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
and then unity well unity has to go in
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
with with something
 
00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:51.990 align:start position:0%
with with something
okay

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
so um we would put unity
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
um it all these other districts are
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
already filled up they're already
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
already made into a float the numbers
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
work so unity can't go in with any of
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
the areas in the float uh district so
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
it's going to have to be put into
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
newport okay that's the sort of the only
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
option under this plan
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
um it might be a little some might say
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's a little unfortunate because
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
newport has is given two seats here and
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
its deviation is negative one percent
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
which is great it would be perfect just
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
to give newport two seats
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
but the problem is unity has to go
 
00:45:25.359 --> 00:45:26.309 align:start position:0%
but the problem is unity has to go
somewhere

00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
okay so the only option is
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay so we added it in but the deviation
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
now is 24.4
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
so then
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
so the the
 
00:45:41.349 --> 00:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
trick now
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
is to try to come up with a
 
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.870 align:start position:0%
is to try to come up with a
um

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know something so put together some
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
other regular districts that we can
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
combine in with this newly created
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
district so that our deviations work out
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
so as you can see this is kind of tricky
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit you have to think about it
 
00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
some people get good at it i never did
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
it very much myself mainly i just kind
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
of developed the tool and let other
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to put
 
00:46:09.119 --> 00:46:11.270 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to put
sunapee

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
sunapee
 
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
sunny baby would be great to leave by
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
itself too
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
it takes one seat just fine but the
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
problem is to make the numbers work
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
overall with the remaining number of
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
limited number of talents to add to it
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
um it just turns out it's going to have
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
to go into a
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
into a district also
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
into a multi-town district so i'm going
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
to add in
 
00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.349 align:start position:0%
to add in
um

00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
add in croydon to it so
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
and then what i'm going to do this is
 
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
going to be a little tricky if i try to
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.109 --> 00:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
the deviation on both of them does not
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
work out they have a the red is negative
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
six percent
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
and the the pink is negative six percent
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
two so it doesn't quite work
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
so we got to do something else
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
and uh the other option
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
and there are ways after you look at the
 
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
numbers a little bit you would know
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
before doing that that that probably
 
00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't work because of the deviations
 
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
of the two underlying uh districts
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
they're at about 25
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
they would need to be both at closer to
 
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
50 in order for that to work
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
well so uh what i'm gonna do is form uh
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
one more district with the remaining
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
here we have another district
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
um this one here actually
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
you can see that it's a fairly large
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
district of 8300 people
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
it it can take two seats i'm going to
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
see it i'm going to change give it two
 
00:47:48.079 --> 00:47:50.549 align:start position:0%
see it i'm going to change give it two
seats

00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
now you'll you'll see it's it still
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
needs a little bit more it's a 26
 
00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.309 align:start position:0%
needs a little bit more it's a 26
percent

00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh deviation
 
00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
and um i'm going to try to combine all
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
these districts together into a float
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
and see if it works and it's supposed to
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
work because it did before so i'm going
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
to create a float
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
i'm going to join join to it
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
join this one to that one
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
here i have an option of which float i
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
want to join i have to decide which one
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
it is it's it's a float 11.
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.319 --> 00:48:23.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
so the all the all the deviations the
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
peak is at 3.7 the the red is at 4.5 and
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
the blue is at 5.0
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
so it's right on the edge but it makes
 
00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.109 align:start position:0%
so it's right on the edge but it makes
it

00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:48:35.119 --> 00:48:36.230 align:start position:0%
it
so

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
basically we've succeeded with sullivan
 
00:48:38.559 --> 00:48:39.510 align:start position:0%
basically we've succeeded with sullivan
county

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
um and this is what
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:57.670 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
yeah that will appear also
 
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to think that joel could you
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
explain what's on the left side of the
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
screen as i'm looking at it and will
 
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
that appear on the thumb drive when
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
we're using
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
this program right
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh yeah this this will be part of what
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
you'll have appear on the left hand side
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
so this is just a tabulation of all of
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
which you see on the right inside of the
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
you know the map part which is putting
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
it in a
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
tabular form and so these are all the
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
so look at
 
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.510 align:start position:0%
so look at
the

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
the top area
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
it shows uh ward three
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's district one has one seat and it
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
shows what its deviation is negative 1.7
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
um and then it does the same for
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh ward one and ward two they're all
 
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
separate districts and then below that
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
you'll see word one two and three
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
all on top of each other and then it's
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
it has a district number of a four
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
put in an f4 so you can kind of keep
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
track of what the floats are
 
00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that there's no deviation
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
for the flow floats never have a
 
00:50:00.319 --> 00:50:01.829 align:start position:0%
for the flow floats never have a
deviation

00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
deviation
 
00:50:01.839 --> 00:50:02.870 align:start position:0%
deviation
um

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
and so that's just a tabular form so
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
that's a good way
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
of um just
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
sort of keeping track
 
00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.670 align:start position:0%
sort of keeping track
of

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
what you what you you've done in a
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
tabular format down below it'll give you
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
the total seats
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
that are are part of it 13
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
in sullivan and then it gives you the
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
the deviation range
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
of negative four percent to five percent
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering uh
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
you said that floats don't have a
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
deviation could you just explain why
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
kind of the basic idea is what you want
 
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
to do in any area where people are
 
00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.309 align:start position:0%
to do in any area where people are
voting

00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
voting
 
00:50:48.319 --> 00:50:49.910 align:start position:0%
voting
um

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're they're on a they're in
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
a particular let's say if you're you're
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
in a uh
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
in a district such as ward one and
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
in claremont
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
you have your own district your own
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
person you're voting for
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
and then you have
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh the the float person that you're
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
voting for also
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
um and so you're in a particular
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
situation that's different from the
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
person in the next ward over
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
okay and so what we're trying to do is
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
figure out whether or not a person in
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
each area um what what kind of their
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
voting strength is what their their
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
voting weight is
 
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:27.670 align:start position:0%
voting weight is
okay

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
if if you just
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
if you do it on a floaterial test basis
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
you would maybe have one percentage one
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
percent for everyone for that whole area
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
and that's more like now and that might
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
be adding all the numbers together right
 
00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
between all the underlying districts
 
00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
um but you
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
you would
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
you know the new hampshire supreme court
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
said if you if you do that type of thing
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
you're basically asking what the true
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
deviation is because everyone's not in
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
the same situation
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know within that whole material
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
everyone has its own
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
individual war too that they're going in
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
and their populations may be
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's a good enough
 
00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.750 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's a good enough
explanation

00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's great great explanation thank you
 
00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.829 align:start position:0%
that's great great explanation thank you
okay

00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
okay

joel this has been very very helpful
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
in any way possible
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
to make things more complicated rather
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
than less
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
by taking a look at other factors in
 
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.549 align:start position:0%
by taking a look at other factors in
addition

00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
addition
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
to those that you have in here now for
 
00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:37.109 align:start position:0%
to those that you have in here now for
example

00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
do all those towns
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
are they in the same
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
school district
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
or have you split up school district
 
00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.589 align:start position:0%
or have you split up school district
representation

00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
i think i'll answer that representative
 
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
smith the
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
requirement is as to numbers
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
um in the final analysis that that is
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
the the first thing that needs to be
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
determined so
 
00:53:02.319 --> 00:53:03.349 align:start position:0%
determined so
um

00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
just like the geography this is a math
 
00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
exercise and i understand that you were
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
on the committee a
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
couple of you have some experience with
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
actually cranking the numbers so
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
this is this is an attempt to avoid the
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
cranking of the numbers i i think that's
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
sort of where we're at it's a math
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
exercise is that correct joel
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean that's
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
they're they're uh yeah there isn't any
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
other data in here except just for the
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
population numbers
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
i mean it so this this tool is just
 
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
designed to answer the one question
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
basically you know does it comply with
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
the one person one vote requirement of
 
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
the federal constitution
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
so so but those things can be
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
considered certainly when you're looking
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
at various maps
 
00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:50.470 align:start position:0%
at various maps
and

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
you know maps that that make sense and
 
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
comply with the deviation requirement
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
you could say well does it really make
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
sense to put this town together that
 
00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
time there are separate school districts
 
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
there's no road between them maybe you
 
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
can consider those things at that point
 
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
and maybe
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
maybe that and that may be why you
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
choose one map over another
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
correct and for example you might
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
find that while on the map itself it
 
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a lot of sense but if
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
there's a highway
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
that connects some it makes sense for a
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
particular district
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative o'hara you have yeah i
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make a comment that the
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
school district thing would be a little
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
bit of an issue in our county because
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
one of our uh towns shared school
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
district with a different county
 
00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.510 align:start position:0%
district with a different county
northfield

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
northfield
 
00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:36.230 align:start position:0%
northfield
well

00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and i will tell you i come
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
from goffstown which i have seen
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
um school districts
 
00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
um change
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
as to who
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
is part of it certainly over the course
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
of of 10 years and at least as far as i
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
know we've managed to keep our town
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
boundaries somewhat
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
consistent um representative
 
00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
ross representative barry did i see your
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.829 align:start position:0%
anybody else
representative

00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you manager i'm not sure if this
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate time to ask the
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
question but i'm curious what all is on
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
the thumb drive right okay so that's i
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
sort of wanted to get through the
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
questions says to the and joel can you
 
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:24.200 align:start position:0%
just humor my
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
non-technological self and tell me how
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
it is i move those little boxes of data
 
00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:31.349 align:start position:0%
it is i move those little boxes of data
around

00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
you just hit him with the cursor and
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
move them oh
 
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah just the cursor
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
just you you put the little pointer on
 
00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:40.230 align:start position:0%
just you you put the little pointer on
the

00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
on the label the cursor on the label and
 
00:55:42.319 --> 00:55:43.750 align:start position:0%
on the label the cursor on the label and
click

00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
click
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
and you can move it okay
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
yeah you can move it moves at that point
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
so you can you can even you know if you
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
mix up your labels
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know if i had if i had a
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
centipede here
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know it's somehow or another i got
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
the label way off and i
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
i mixed up overs whereas this the
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
centerpiece label is up here
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
and i forget which one's sunapee you say
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
i can just click on the centerview label
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
and create a district and it'll say oh
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's there so it's it's always tied
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
to the area the label is
 
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
so other questions on the software
 
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:37.910 align:start position:0%
so other questions on the software
representative

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for madam chair um is this
 
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
software available to the general public
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
any other questions in regards to this
 
00:56:54.079 --> 00:56:59.109 align:start position:0%
any other questions in regards to this
representative

00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
what is the best software for us to use
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
to open up this manager oh we're gonna
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
go through how to open it up okay all
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
right so you all
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
you all have a thumb drive
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
and um as representative bergeron
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
pointed out
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh there is going to be data that
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
changes specifically in regards to city
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
boards because that would not that that
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
will be something we are dealing with
 
00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
locally so you will be getting updates
 
00:57:26.319 --> 00:57:27.109 align:start position:0%
locally so you will be getting updates
and

00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that there were
 
00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:30.470 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that there were
some

00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
there might be some technical glitches
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
in this data remember this data was just
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
released less than two weeks ago
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
um joel has been downloading it and try
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the programming
 
00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.390 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the programming
matches

00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
matches
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
all of the data so joel is going to go
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
use this on your own computer
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
and what if anything might not be
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
exactly right at the current time that
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
we will need updated thumb drives for
 
00:57:58.079 --> 00:57:59.349 align:start position:0%
we will need updated thumb drives for
joel

00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
joel
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure would it be okay there were
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
a couple other things they wanted to
 
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
cover on that oh sure go ahead i'm sorry
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay and then i can get back to
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
the thumbnails
 
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.510 align:start position:0%
the thumbnails
um

00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to go through quickly
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
um that once you have a
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
plan put together for uh say a county
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
um there's there's option options at the
 
00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.390 align:start position:0%
um there's there's option options at the
top

00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
top
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
where you can save and open a county
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
so so you can you know save your work
 
00:58:30.549 --> 00:58:30.559 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to just save the county
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
you know just save your plan and so i'm
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
and so now it's saved that that county
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
is saved
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
if i um go on to a
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
another county i'm just going to go
 
00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:59.670 align:start position:0%
another county i'm just going to go
um

00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
to merrimack
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
one thing that i wanted to to a couple
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
things i just wanted to show
 
00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
here in terms of
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
merrimack it could be could be any
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
counting i'm just going to merrimack
 
00:59:11.359 --> 00:59:12.309 align:start position:0%
counting i'm just going to merrimack
um

00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
that there's a function in here called
 
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.190 align:start position:0%
that there's a function in here called
solutions

00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
solutions
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a label
 
00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
or a button that you can press called
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
solutions and what that is is is it
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
brings up there's a database behind each
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
one of the counties
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
that's pre-compiled that shows
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh various uh potential maps
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh for that county that that comply with
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
the the five percent you know 10 overall
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
deviation requirement
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
um and it's there's certain
 
00:59:43.599 --> 00:59:45.430 align:start position:0%
um and it's there's certain
there's

00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's a separate program that's run ahead
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
to create the database
 
00:59:51.599 --> 00:59:52.390 align:start position:0%
to create the database
and

00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
there's certain parameters that are used
 
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
with the intent of creating uh maps that
 
00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:58.390 align:start position:0%
with the intent of creating uh maps that
generally

00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
generally
 
01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
have are smaller in size
 
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
and in population
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
and which
 
01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.069 align:start position:0%
and which
um

01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
and are more you know numerous to have
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
more districts rather than fewer which i
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
think generally people have come to
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
accept is is probably a
 
01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
a good idea at least last time around 10
 
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
years ago that was one of the guidelines
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the committee we want to create
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
maps with as many districts as possible
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
so anyway um
 
01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:23.829 align:start position:0%
so anyway um
so

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
there are these
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
so that's been
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
done um and
 
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
so i can just show that to you if i
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
press up solutions button for an empty
 
01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.829 align:start position:0%
press up solutions button for an empty
map

01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
map
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
uh here in merrimack it's going to pop
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
up a table
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
that shows um
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
various potential maps
 
01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
for the the county and this doesn't mean
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
that these are the only maps that are
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
possible certainly other maps might be
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
suitable doesn't mean that every map on
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
here is a good map okay but it's just an
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
aid a tool that members can use
 
01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.549 align:start position:0%
aid a tool that members can use
to

01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
to explore what what different maps
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
the solutions
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
tab is that just map out base districts
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
or also floaters
 
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
protereals because that's the difficulty
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
it's not so easy to put together maps
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
because of those materials
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
who developed those maps
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's a piece of software that i
 
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.190 align:start position:0%
it's a piece of software that i
developed

01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
developed
 
01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.470 align:start position:0%
developed
because

01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
and that's that was developed
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
in the last during the last 10 years
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
since the last
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
time this was done
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
and i just i just saw that you know
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
there was an issue
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
the difficulty users have in making maps
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
it's not obvious necessarily how these
 
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
districts go together so i thought well
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's sort of a
 
01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.390 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's sort of a
um

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
as you can see it's kind of a
 
01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.710 align:start position:0%
as you can see it's kind of a
mathematical

01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
mathematical
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
sort of uh
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
process you have to go through and so
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
computers are good at that
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
they're good at doing iterations
 
01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:15.039 align:start position:0%
and so this is basically
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
other software
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
that you're seeing right now another
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
piece of software that um does these
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
iterations on finding all the possible
 
01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.190 align:start position:0%
iterations on finding all the possible
maps

01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
maps
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not so it's
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
for me
 
01:02:32.829 --> 01:02:32.839 align:start position:0%
i mean from the you know the software i
 
01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
okay joel did you have anything else
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
before we go to the thumbnails
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm just going to click on one of
 
01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
these just to show you how the map works
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay i just um
 
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
there are just a look at the table
 
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
really quickly it shows a few stats
 
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
relative to each one of the maps it's
 
01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
mean deviation it's deviation range
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
constituents per seat
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
total seats few or were shorted
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
district total seat total and you can
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
sort these
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:24.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
all right so so there's the table there
 
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
um and so i'm just gonna i'm gonna sort
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
it by um deviation range just
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
maybe you care about deviation ranges
 
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
you know maybe that's a big thing and
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
you want one but the smallest deviation
 
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.230 align:start position:0%
you want one but the smallest deviation
range

01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
range
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
and so this
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
it's sorted now that that one at the top
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
has the lowest deviation range i click
 
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
on it
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
and it's filled in the map
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
so you can you can take a look at that
 
01:03:49.599 --> 01:03:50.710 align:start position:0%
so you can you can take a look at that
map

01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
map
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.319 --> 01:04:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
i thought i i oh i need a resha i got i
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
and so so here's a map you can take a
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
look at it see what you think i'll just
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
show you one other thing that i can do
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
um there's a button up here to reset map
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna get rid of that map okay so
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
it just clears it out and i can say
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
um you know i maybe you're somebody who
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
lives in new london you just say
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
i wanna i want
 
01:04:34.559 --> 01:04:35.510 align:start position:0%
i wanna i want
my

01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh new london to be on its own okay but
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
i don't care about the rest of the
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
county so show me a map
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
that that does that or show me maps that
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
so you click on solutions
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
and so this is a smaller table but all
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
of these will
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
will be ones where new london has its
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
own district
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.799 --> 01:05:01.829 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
i do this long enough i'll
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
these there's still quite a few of them
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
here so i'm just going to click on one
 
01:05:18.079 --> 01:05:19.270 align:start position:0%
here so i'm just going to click on one
and

01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
there we go there's a map
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
you could have sorted that other table
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to based on whatever your
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
criteria is
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
so so there you go and there you see
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
that new london is its own district
 
01:05:38.559 --> 01:05:39.270 align:start position:0%
that new london is its own district
so

01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
i have no idea you'd have to take a look
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
at this map see if you like it you can
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
also not do just one
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
district you could complete it as much
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
as you want
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
hit the solutions button and it'll show
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
you any maps that it may have in the
 
01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:52.710 align:start position:0%
you any maps that it may have in the
database

01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
database
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
may not show you anything maybe there's
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
nothing who knows maybe you
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
got yourself into a corner or whatever
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
could happen or or or it's kind of
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so but there's no promise that this
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
this will have every possible map in it
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay it's just an aid you can ignore it
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
if you want
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
it depends on you
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
the last thing would be
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
you want me to
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh just so you know you can kind of work
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
on counties county by county so like i
 
01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.430 align:start position:0%
on counties county by county so like i
could

01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to just save this one
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
so so that's saved also and then you can
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
save once you get all your counties done
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
or maybe two counties whatever you want
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
then you can save the whole plan
 
01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
this one apparently i called nothing
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
much i was just playing around
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
and so this is nothing much
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
um and i'll i'll save that one
 
01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.990 align:start position:0%
um and i'll i'll save that one
um

01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
and um so now we have both
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh merrimack saved and also what we were
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
working on um
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
sullivan so sullivan is saved too so if
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
i come back in i can open up both of
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
those by opening the plan and they'll
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
both pop up
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
so you can work on both the county level
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
or the whole state level
 
01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
so that is basically i think what i have
 
01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:15.990 align:start position:0%
so that is basically i think what i have
to

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
show i guess um so we could move on to
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
and uh that software always gives you
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
prompts whether you want to save a plan
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
before you
 
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
to you know accidentally
 
01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
on your your
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
thumb drive
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to show you also
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
well i guess
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
i'm running over
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
well we need to go through this joel so
 
01:07:57.270 --> 01:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
you get the floor okay all right
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to show you also
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
um how you can go about
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
um deleting the program from from your
 
01:08:05.119 --> 01:08:06.150 align:start position:0%
um deleting the program from from your
computer

01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
computer
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
why don't we why don't we get into the
 
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
installation first time okay
 
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
let's do that first um
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
i don't want to put the focus at the
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
first on deletion and if um
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wonder if somebody's paying
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
attention i don't know are you a do you
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
expect that we're looking at something
 
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
on the screen or not because i'm not
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
so sharing screen needs to happen again
 
01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:35.269 align:start position:0%
so sharing screen needs to happen again
somehow

01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
yeah we're back to the original screen
 
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
setup whenever you closed out that
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
program we lost what was
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
the connection i think to your screen
 
01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:44.789 align:start position:0%
the connection i think to your screen
okay

01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
all right there we go
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
so you're are you just seeing the the
 
01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
whiteboard right now just whiteboard
 
01:09:04.839 --> 01:09:06.630 align:start position:0%
whiteboard right now just whiteboard
okay

01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:11.269 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
i wanted to
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
show the
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
show the laptop here made my uh
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.149 align:start position:0%
 
hopefully

01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
you just need a more talented operator
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
here that's all
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
i think from this demonstration it's
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
pretty clear that we're going to have to
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
play around with the software
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
and make
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
multiple tries at maps before we can
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
decide that anything is
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
is good enough to present to our public
 
01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.709 align:start position:0%
is good enough to present to our public
because

01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
obviously there's going to be more than
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
joel why don't we go through we have
 
01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
some drives what kind of computer system
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
do we need
 
01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:53.750 align:start position:0%
do we need
to

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
install it
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
actually you know
 
01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.550 align:start position:0%
actually you know
um

01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
you need a windows computer
 
01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:04.310 align:start position:0%
you need a windows computer
um

01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the the
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
way it works now
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh that's not to say
 
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
and i don't know what the plans are i
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
have a windows computer and so that the
 
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.110 align:start position:0%
have a windows computer and so that the
um

01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:17.669 --> 01:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
the packaging tool that i have
 
01:11:17.679 --> 01:11:18.550 align:start position:0%
the packaging tool that i have
um

01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
it makes it so that it creates a an
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
installation file for whatever computer
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
that you use
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
to to create it the um
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
the installation file so the
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
installation file is made for windows
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
computers okay at this point
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
my understanding is if
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
if i did that on an apple computer and
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
installation file would work on an apple
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
computer i haven't done that or a linux
 
01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
computer say
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
okay and when we install it and go ask
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
our computer to open this drive what are
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh you're going to see what's going to
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
happen is um
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
when you put your thumb driving in your
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
computer you're gonna see um
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
i think you'll see three files on there
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
one file will be labeled um
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
read first
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
license agreement
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
so you should read that first
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
and then that controls the the software
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
and in terms of use of that software
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
and then the two other files
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
uh one will be
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
the house redistricting file and it'll
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
just be a file that is is executable
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
so all you do is
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
you click on it double click on it
 
01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
and it'll pop up
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
and it's a
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
it's an installer and it's a windows
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
installer basically and it will install
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
the program on your computer
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
and it will put a um
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
a shortcut on your desktop
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
and then then to run the program what
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
you need to do is um
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
just click click on that icon and the
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
program will come up
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
so it's very simple
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
type of installation you don't even have
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
or whatever it's an automatic install
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's the way it works and you said
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
there were three files
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
yes and the third file is for
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
um doing congressional districts
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
so it's the it's basically the same
 
01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.709 align:start position:0%
so it's the it's basically the same
software

01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
software
 
01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
um but it's it's uh
 
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
it has there's a switch in there that
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
you can turn it on so it does statewide
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
so that statewide switch has been turned
 
01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.510 align:start position:0%
so that statewide switch has been turned
on

01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
and um it's um
 
01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
the deviation will be calculated based
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
on two districts for the congressional
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
one because there are only two seats per
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
congressional district so as you and all
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
you'll be doing with that software is
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
creating two large districts
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
so if you i don't know who's doing that
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
i was just asked to put that together um
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
and so it'll give you a deviation at the
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
end you know with the
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
district label
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't use a floaterial function
 
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
with that because of the fact
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
that uh well you don't have so materials
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
and uh you know in congressional
 
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
districts and
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
um it but it it i was gonna try to turn
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
that off but it was gonna take a lot of
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
playing with
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
the guts of the computer and
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
didn't want to do that or didn't have
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
the time to do that all right so i think
 
01:14:33.189 --> 01:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
we're all set on what you're going to
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
see when you put it in your computer
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
um is there a separate one for the
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
executive counselors
 
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
not as young
 
01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:44.630 align:start position:0%
not as young
um

01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
you know it would be the same thing
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
as the congressional one
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
um except
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
just need to change the number of seats
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
going to show my ignorance here how many
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
executive consular seats are there in
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
this state the software that we have um
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
in the house
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
retain the services of joel
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
for deal with what he just spoke of
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
as he said there is an end license end
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
user license agreement please read it
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
um normally we would have you have to
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
click that before you get to the program
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
but because we wanted you to get this
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
information today
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
um it is separate so i am asking you to
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
please read it because this is a
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
legislative work product as joel
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
explained this was something that he
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
worked on 10 years ago and over the past
 
01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
10 years and it's the intellectual
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
property of the general court
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
in regards to the maps themselves you
 
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
you know that this committee has six
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
bills we had a public hearing on it
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
and retained the six bills um
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
and the senate as of this time of course
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
has their own rules and hasn't done
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
bills but i can tell you that
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
historically the senate has been given
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to work on
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
their district lines for its own body as
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
has this body
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
and i expect that going forward under my
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
chairmanship we are going to honor that
 
01:16:15.669 --> 01:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
historical agreement where they will be
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
working on their senate lines right off
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
the executive council
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
and we will of course that will be
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
subject to our review but that will be
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
in their
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
purview in the first instance as the
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
house districts which you have just seen
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
um the software for
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
will be in our
 
01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.430 align:start position:0%
will be in our
um

01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
just in our purview i i am also
 
01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
expecting that
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
the senate will be taking on the in the
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
first instance the proposals for
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
the executive council
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
that is my expectation as we all know
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
the senate runs on its own timeline and
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
we sort of
 
01:16:58.229 --> 01:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
wait to see what happens but that's the
 
01:16:58.239 --> 01:16:59.669 align:start position:0%
wait to see what happens but that's the
expectation

01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
expectation
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
and that that means that our initial
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
focus will be on my expectation is and
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
that's how we're going forward is the
 
01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:08.550 align:start position:0%
that's how we're going forward is the
house

01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
and the congressional districts
 
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
there are also obviously two other bills
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
in regards to the county commissioners
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
and the state party
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
delegates which is sort of a little
 
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
nuanced one but
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
that in the first instance is how i
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
expect this work to be going forward um
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
as you can see you're going to have
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
plenty of you're going to need plenty of
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
time to play with the maps for the house
 
01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.229 align:start position:0%
time to play with the maps for the house
districts

01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
it's not quite as straight forward as
 
01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.990 align:start position:0%
it's not quite as straight forward as
people

01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
seem to think it is especially due to
 
01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
the size of our districts and
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
representation is very unusual
 
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
and it makes it frankly probably the
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
most complicated mathematically task
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
that we have in front of us so
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to be getting that and
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
is there anything on the disk right now
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
that is not accurate or we shouldn't
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
rely on
 
01:18:04.159 --> 01:18:05.189 align:start position:0%
rely on
um

01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
no i think everything on the disk
 
01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge is accurate
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know the census data is in there
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
the new numbers i feel confident about
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
those numbers
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
um the main problem i was having with
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
the four counties
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
map database for them
 
01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
so you know that solutions i i showed
 
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
you before
 
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
that does not work
 
01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:33.669 align:start position:0%
that does not work
um

01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
so colossus grafton rockingham and
 
01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:36.950 align:start position:0%
so colossus grafton rockingham and
stratford

01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
stratford
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
those four um and that was just because
 
01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:41.669 align:start position:0%
those four um and that was just because
um

01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
takes a
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
part of it is
 
01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
it would take some computing
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
power or time to run some of those
 
01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:51.350 align:start position:0%
power or time to run some of those
um

01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.229 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
in one of the counties
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh stratfor there's some blog in this
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
software that i'm not quite sure where
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
it came from so basically
 
01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:01.830 align:start position:0%
it came from so basically
um

01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
so what you have
 
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to do mapping your basic
 
01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
mapping for all the counties but when if
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
you try to do the solutions
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
on coast graft and rockingham and
 
01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:13.510 align:start position:0%
on coast graft and rockingham and
stratford

01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
stratford
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
um you won't get anything
 
01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
just to repeat what joel said so that's
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
clear on
 
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
the solutions button which is which is
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
sort of unique does not work for coast
 
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
rockingham stratford and grafton you can
 
01:19:32.229 --> 01:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
still click on the county you still do
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
your maps you just don't have the
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
benefit of the programming to do
 
01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:39.669 align:start position:0%
benefit of the programming to do
one

01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
possible solution for those
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
so when you click on it and you don't
 
01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
get anything it's not that your
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
data is not working it's not there
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
and frankly you know given i'm more
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
concerned i as chair more concerned with
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
making sure this census data is accurate
 
01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
was tied to the communities and then my
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
focus will be on updating having him
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
update for the ward information as it
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
so we can do that in any other updates
 
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
but um the solutions was a nice
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
thing but
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's not critical to us getting our work
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
done and so i wanted you to get
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
the data and the thumb drive today
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
so follow up on the other question i
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
asked i understand the senate will take
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
the first stab at the congressional
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
executive council on the other seats
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
will we have the tools to double
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
checking for the fund
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
at that time i don't know
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
because the senate has not made
 
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
definitive plans at this point and at
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
this point this is what we have with
 
01:20:47.679 --> 01:20:49.189 align:start position:0%
this point this is what we have with
joel

01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
joel
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
madame chairman i think representatives
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
the senate my understanding is
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
not used to the congressional district
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative lane my understanding
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
from what madam chairman chambers said
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
is that we will start with a current
 
01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:03.910 align:start position:0%
is that we will start with a current
expectation

01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
expectation
 
01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
correct representative lane wants a
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
program to redo what the senate does and
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
at this point the senate has not made
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:15.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:18.470 align:start position:0%
okay
thanks

01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
when you don't know if you're not clear
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
you never know when you're clarified so
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
all right anything else on the
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
programming representative william
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh i thank you madam chair i have two
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
questions the first uh i'm curious if uh
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
data on race from the 2020 census
 
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh is built into this software at all to
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
be in compliance with the voting rights
 
01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.310 align:start position:0%
be in compliance with the voting rights
act

01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
act
 
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
no there's no erased data in there
 
01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:48.390 align:start position:0%
no there's no erased data in there
okay

01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and the the other question
 
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know it's a it's about your
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
continued involvement in this and really
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
grateful for your service to the general
 
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
court control i'm curious if you will be
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
a resource
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh to the committee
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh as a nonpartisan you know expert in
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
this uh to help us draw our events
 
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:14.639 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm most happy to talk with any
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
member of the committee you know if you
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
have any questions about the software
 
01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:18.950 align:start position:0%
have any questions about the software
um

01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to help you make a map
 
01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
at all but in terms of being
 
01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.950 align:start position:0%
at all but in terms of being
non-partisan

01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
non-partisan
 
01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
um i worked for the house community
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
research office for 30 some years and
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
that was our role there and i i didn't
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
yeah other questions
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.430 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
on the install you put the thumb drive
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
in i wanted to get a little more
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
granular is it a better practice to copy
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:57.990 --> 01:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
um works both ways i tried it both ways
 
01:22:59.189 --> 01:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
i think you can do it straight from the
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
thumb drive
 
01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.390 align:start position:0%
thumb drive
okay

01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
it'll install the files on your computer
 
01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.390 align:start position:0%
it'll install the files on your computer
so

01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
anything else on the on the programming
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
so joel joel has been retained
 
01:23:20.719 --> 01:23:21.750 align:start position:0%
so joel joel has been retained
um

01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:24.400 align:start position:0%

not be working on maps with 2020 he's
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
maintaining a non-partisan position and
 
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
not getting involved
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure who wanted that more
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
all right so what if you could why don't
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
you stay and
 
01:25:06.709 --> 01:25:06.719 align:start position:0%
and then after after the meeting if
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
committee members want to talk to you
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
they can
 
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
all right um going back to our agenda we
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
had talked in our meeting
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
in june hard to believe it was almost
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
two months ago now
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
um adoption of standards for for mapping
 
01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
because part of what's going to happen
 
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
in this process are
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
public listening sessions in the various
 
01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:33.350 align:start position:0%
public listening sessions in the various
counties

01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
counties
 
01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
i have decided that it would be helpful
 
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
when we go to those county listening
 
01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
sessions if it's very clear to people
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
participating in those sessions that
 
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
they understand
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
what our parameters are as as you just
 
01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
saw this is very much a math exercise
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
and the most basic component of it is
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
the census data we are required to use
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
the census data i will tell you um it is
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
my preference that we make that clear
 
01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:02.870 align:start position:0%
my preference that we make that clear
because

01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
i understand but that there are
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
different jurisdictions that are
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
considering whether or not they are
 
01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
going to proceed with the census data
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
without litigation
 
01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
because of some adjustments that the
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
census did to the data
 
01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.270 align:start position:0%
census did to the data
i

01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
01:26:22.629 --> 01:26:22.639 align:start position:0%
basis from what i can tell for new
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire to do that we have been told
 
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
representative smith and i i had the
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity along with representative
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
wilhelm to to attend a national
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
conference when the census data was
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
presented um excuse me people from the
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
census data were there um
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
in regards to the fact that the numbers
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
that were being presented were the
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
numbers we were going to be using um and
 
01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
there is no leeway i don't believe in
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
our constitution or our work to to do
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
that so
 
01:26:53.189 --> 01:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
it would be my preference that this
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
committee adopt by motion that the 2020
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
census data numbers will in fact be
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
those used for our work proceeding
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte thank you madam
 
01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
chair i do make a motion that the new
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire house special committee
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
on redistricting utilizes the population
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
numbers provided in the 2021 u.s census
 
01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:15.189 align:start position:0%
numbers provided in the 2021 u.s census
data

01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
that's been moved and seconded is there
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
not seeing any i'm going to ask the
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.189 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:42.470 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:12.709 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:12.719 --> 01:28:20.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:25.990 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
look at that
 
01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
um in regards to the specific tasks that
 
01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
we need to do i think as we've all
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
realized this morning that the house is
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
certainly of direct interest and one of
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
the more
 
01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.470 align:start position:0%
the more
difficult

01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
tasks to undertake
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
in our previous meeting we discussed
 
01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
the requirements in the constitution and
 
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
in law and we've discussed that a little
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
is there a motion in regards to what
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
there should be the basic math criteria
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
district representative mcguire yes i
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
move that we
 
01:29:16.709 --> 01:29:16.719 align:start position:0%
make the house district such that county
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
lines are not frost
 
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
and we follow the constitutional
 
01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
requirements that they be contiguous and
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
vary from
 
01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
and did that include city and
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
unincorporated places also
 
01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
unincorporated places yes if we don't
 
01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
reach ward lines we won't be reaching
 
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
city lines thank you um i will and thank
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
you for that clarification there are
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
some cities who have finally thrown up
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
their hands in regards to warts and made
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
it toward the city line so i'm not sure
 
01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
forward what they're going to be using
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
so we'll we'll see representative
 
01:29:59.669 --> 01:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
bergeron will tell us a little more
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
about that is there any further
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm going to ask the clerk

01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
um i think that the groundwork is laid
 
01:30:59.110 --> 01:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
now for us to do our own mapping and to
 
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
get going into the
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
counties throughout the state to
 
01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
have our listening meetings with persons
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
to find out what they want to hear and i
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
hope people have been able to see on
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
youtube i understand the youtube
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
streaming was working
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
or at least hear that we have been
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
getting your emails and letters in
 
01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
regards to
 
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
wanting your own representative if you
 
01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
have enough people in your community we
 
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
have so the public is aware we have been
 
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
provided by staff
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
a number of communications that have
 
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
been received from the public over the
 
01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:35.350 align:start position:0%
been received from the public over the
past

01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
weeks in regards to positions that we
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
should take so we have those in hand
 
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
and we will be considering all of that
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
as we go forward before i talk about
 
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
those listening sessions
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron has agreed to
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
update us on what's happening with the
 
01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:53.430 align:start position:0%
update us on what's happening with the
cities

01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
cities
 
01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:54.229 align:start position:0%
cities
and

01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
how they are proceeding and you should
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
going around passing it out now
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to convince representative
 
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
bergeron that he does not have to do the
 
01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:07.189 align:start position:0%
bergeron that he does not have to do the
printing

01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
printing
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
at his own home that we can do it
 
01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
at the staff here but we wanted to make
 
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
sure it got done so thank you
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
may i begin yes representative thank you
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you pretty much while those sheets
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
are going around i
 
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
and i have mentioned this in the
 
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
previous meeting but since we have some
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
replacements present i want to repeat it
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
um census tracts are supposed to fall
 
01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
within or fall along voting district
 
01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:36.870 align:start position:0%
within or fall along voting district
boundaries

01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
boundaries
 
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
and that happens of course in our towns
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
because the town lines are the voting
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
district boundaries
 
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes however
 
01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
the census makes mistakes and they the
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
census tracts do not necessarily follow
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
ward boundaries
 
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
so the data that you have uh that's been
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
uploaded from the census is probably
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
correct in 99 of the entrance
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
in instances
 
01:33:03.669 --> 01:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh but we may have to keep our ears to
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
the ground to see what's happening in
 
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
the cities as they start overlaying the
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
census data with their own um ward lines
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
on gis and the example i gave previously
 
01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
is what occurred in nashua about 10
 
01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
years ago where the census treated the
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
eastern boundary of one of our wards as
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
route 3
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
which is a major road north south in
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
southern new hampshire with uh
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
where the actual war boundary was the
 
01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
daniel webster highway a little to the
 
01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:32.070 align:start position:0%
daniel webster highway a little to the
east

01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
east
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
which is the the mall district of the
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
city and in between about 1100 people
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
resided so that meant according to the
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
census there were 1100 people less than
 
01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
one ward and 1100 people more in the
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
other and so we had to uh to make some
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
adjustments to the census data by moving
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
population blocks from one word to the
 
01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:53.750 align:start position:0%
population blocks from one word to the
other

01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
nations so just something to keep in
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
mind that something like this manchester
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
but not to that degree and it may occur
 
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
in other cities as well
 
01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
as for the the table that i distributed
 
01:34:03.679 --> 01:34:04.950 align:start position:0%
as for the the table that i distributed
um

01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
i think we optimistically hoped that the
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
cities would all complete redistricting
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
and stay within perhaps a 10 range of
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
deviation uh during that process
 
01:34:17.669 --> 01:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh it appears that that
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
may not be as simple uh as we had hoped
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
it would be it may not occur in all the
 
01:34:25.110 --> 01:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
cities so i would like to flag a couple
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
of instances where we might need to keep
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
in mind that this is not occurring or
 
01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
may not occur in time for our
 
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
redistricting work the first is the city
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
of franklin
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
the city of franklin sent a letter to
 
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
the committee asking that it be treated
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
as a single legislative district
 
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
when i looked at the city charter online
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
there are footnotes whenever a charter
 
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
is amended uh on the caught a fire's
 
01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:49.510 align:start position:0%
is amended uh on the caught a fire's
website

01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
website
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
and the last time ward lines were
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
amended in franklin was 1995.
 
01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.310 align:start position:0%
amended in franklin was 1995.
so

01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
we also have a statement from them
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
indicating that they do not expect to
 
01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
have the redistricting done prior to the
 
01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
time this committee's work is done
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
so we may have to uh consider treating
 
01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
franklin as its city as a city-wide uh
 
01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
district as part of any flow materials
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
that occur
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
the another one to be concerned about is
 
01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:18.229 align:start position:0%
the another one to be concerned about is
claremont

01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
claremont
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
i had been told by the city clerk that
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
claremont did not redistrict in 2011
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
and the reason they did not do so is in
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
part because their legal counsel had
 
01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
advised them since they had nine
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
counselors three of whom were elected
 
01:35:35.189 --> 01:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
one of each in each of three wards and
 
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
the other six at large that they didn't
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
need to uh redistrict because the
 
01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
majority of their council was elected at
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
large based on joel's demonstration it
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
may also be true that uh the actual
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
census numbers fell within that 10 range
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
of deviation anyway and perhaps there
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
was no reason for them to redistrict but
 
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
at the present time they don't have any
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh committee appointed they don't have a
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
plan yet to conduct any redistricting in
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
claremont so i don't know what the
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
actual numbers and the awards for
 
01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.229 align:start position:0%
actual numbers and the awards for
claremont

01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
claremont
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
will be or if they'll have anything done
 
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
prior to our work being completed
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
the third one
 
01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:13.590 align:start position:0%
the third one
uh

01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
i wanted to flag a summit's worth
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
somersworth process uh for
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
redoing the award lines is done by
 
01:36:22.709 --> 01:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
referendum a committee has to be
 
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
appointed consisting of several council
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
members they need to come to agreement
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
with the new ward lines would be and
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
then it has to be sent to the voters
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
at quote the next election that's
 
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
unclear whether it's a special election
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
or a regular election i would assume a
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
special election could be held but uh we
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
should assume nothing
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
and right now no committee has yet been
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
appointed in summer's work so we don't
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
know what their what their plans are
 
01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh the cities of dover and keene are
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
trying to amend their
 
01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:56.229 align:start position:0%
trying to amend their
charters

01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
charters
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
at the november election to allow them
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
to make changes to ward lines by
 
01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
ordinance that would expedite the
 
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
process if they can get these questions
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
approved by the voters
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
the big concern with both cities is the
 
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%
timeline between now and the date when
 
01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots have to be ready for
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
the november election
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
after there's been a public hearing on
 
01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
the new ward lines or on the new charter
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that has to be submitted to
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
the department of revenue administration
 
01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office and the
 
01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office for approval
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
and usually they have up to 60 days to
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
either approve or reject the request to
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
amend the amendment
 
01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
amend the charter so uh it's going to be
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
critical that those three state agencies
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
react quickly to the requests of these
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
two cities
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
and approve that charter amendment so
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
they can get it on the ballot
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
the other cities have pretty much laid
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
out their plans uh portsmouth has to do
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
it by change to state law
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
we need to still talk to the portsmouth
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
officials to find out how that's going
 
01:37:59.830 --> 01:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
during our last meeting the chair had
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
submitted a copy to us of
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
the portsmouth award lines that was done
 
01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
as a session law in 2012
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
and so they need to
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
i assume they're going to need to file a
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
bill uh requesting that the ward lines
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
be changed
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
or it's going to have to be an amendment
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
to one of our
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
redistricting bills to make sure that
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
it's done it's our bill it's our bill
 
01:38:24.159 --> 01:38:25.669 align:start position:0%
it's done it's our bill it's our bill
okay

01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
one way or the other portsmouth needs to
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
get to work and define those ward lines
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
and we need to make sure that it becomes
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
part of the state law
 
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
and with that i guess i could answer to
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions people might
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
have but i think i highlighted the
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
those areas of concern or interests that
 
01:38:44.229 --> 01:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
i thought the committee like might like
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
so so we know the timeline is going to
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:59.669 --> 01:38:59.679 align:start position:0%
we need to proceed regardless
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
our goal
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
remains to report out november 18th
 
01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
we do know of course that this is the
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
end of the bill review process it needs
 
01:39:13.350 --> 01:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
to go to our full body and to the senate
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
so to the extent
 
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
certain things might be figured out
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
after that point in time there is an
 
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
amendment process under rules in both
 
01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:24.149 align:start position:0%
amendment process under rules in both
houses

01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
houses
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
but obviously the preference would be
 
01:39:29.109 --> 01:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
not to have to do that
 
01:39:29.119 --> 01:39:30.229 align:start position:0%
not to have to do that
so

01:39:30.229 --> 01:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
to the extent we're going to be able to
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
figure that out
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
the better and i want to thank
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron and
 
01:39:38.229 --> 01:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
representative lane is helping him out
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
on doing this work questions for
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing it
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
um the review i have put on the review
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
of county listening session locations
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
and i have this on here because
 
01:39:59.350 --> 01:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
lindsay and i have begun calling the
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
places that were used 10 years ago
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
and i want to get some committee input
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
in regards to locations
 
01:40:10.709 --> 01:40:10.719 align:start position:0%
as to their their feasibility you will
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
note that a number of the locations that
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
were used last time were nursing homes
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to assume in the first
 
01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
instance that nursing homes are not
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
going to be available for public
 
01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:23.430 align:start position:0%
going to be available for public
meetings

01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
um so that means that even if all of
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
these are still available and some were
 
01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
not available to be booked until the
 
01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
actual calendar month of september which
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
is why you don't have a schedule in
 
01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
front of you i want to go through each
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
county and i'm going to open it up to
 
01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
representatives to see if they have any
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
suggestions for other locations
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative smith um i have a
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
threshold question uh madam chair can
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
you tell me the difference between a
 
01:40:52.709 --> 01:40:52.719 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
where we receive
 
01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
information from the public um
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
i'm just
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
working from the bills that we have
 
01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:02.830 align:start position:0%
working from the bills that we have
already

01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
filed and a listening session
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
um my view and you can see i apparently
 
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
have a different view than they had ten
 
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
years ago is that public hearings are a
 
01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
legislative process associated with a
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
specific bill
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
for which we open
 
01:41:19.679 --> 01:41:21.270 align:start position:0%
for which we open
hearing

01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:41:24.149 --> 01:41:24.159 align:start position:0%
i do not intend to conduct these opening
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
up a public hearing on
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
specific bills we can do it that way
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
we've already had that public hearing
 
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
when we retained the bills
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
so i'm just referring these to these as
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
a listening session additionally i want
 
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:41.679 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that it is not
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
necessary for the full committee to be
 
01:41:46.229 --> 01:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
at these historically because they are
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
around the state what happens is at
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
least i think it was five members
 
01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
of the committee attended and one person
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
would be designated the chair for that
 
01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:57.910 align:start position:0%
would be designated the chair for that
session

01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:58.950 align:start position:0%
session
and

01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
someone else would be there to serve as
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
a clerk or to help us get the feedback
 
01:42:07.270 --> 01:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
from people at the session so i'm i have
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
simply phrased it that way because i'm
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
not going to conduct it as an open
 
01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:12.070 align:start position:0%
not going to conduct it as an open
closed

01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
closed
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
public hearing represent follow-up
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
as a hearing
 
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
obligation for us to have a full form
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
i'm aware it's only when it's an
 
01:42:25.590 --> 01:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
executive session and the last thing
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to be doing is voting
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
but in terms of public perception
 
01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
we want to be clear to the public
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
that we take
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
what they say seriously we're listening
 
01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:45.189 align:start position:0%
what they say seriously we're listening
carefully

01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
carefully
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
and the usual nomenclature would be a
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
hearing a listening session
 
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
is somewhat less
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
specific and i would hope you would
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
consider that and suggest referring to
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
these as public hearings thank you

all right thank you for that
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
clarification i i in no way intended to
 
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
create a record that indicated we
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
weren't doing exactly the same thing

thank you madam chair
uh

01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
do we intend to have any public hearings
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh after maps are drawn i understand
 
01:43:45.669 --> 01:43:45.679 align:start position:0%
these listening
 
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.320 align:start position:0%

uh

01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
to be before maps are drawn
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
will there be an opportunity for the
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
public to review maps and share their
 
01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.430 align:start position:0%

feedback
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
after the mastercard yes
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
we have created a website that will
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
allow comment to be submitted to the
 
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
committee along with maps to be uploaded
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
so that people can
 
01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
provide maps
 
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
the remote
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
access to public meetings is
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
also due to our geography
 
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
and technical limitations there are some
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
portions of the state we're providing
 
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
that really is not providing anything
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
and it's not clear to me where we're
 
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
going to be providing these service
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
providing these services given what i
 
01:45:01.590 --> 01:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
see as more limitations on locations to
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
have these
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
feed on a dead horse but most of these i
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
know in merrimack if we have it most of
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
the county
 
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding the county commission
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
hearings are available
 
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
so if we use those facilities we should
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
well again there is a difference between
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
live streaming and access so i'm not
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
sure what you're talking about in
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
regards to that because it is not the
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
intent to
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
take comment remotely certainly but
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
there is nothing that would prevent
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
anybody from
 
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
filming what is a public meeting and i
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
know that all counties do not have that
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
because i know that in hillsborough i
 
01:45:55.590 --> 01:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
contacted the hillsborough county
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
in regards to whether or not we would be
 
01:45:59.109 --> 01:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
able to use their room and there are
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
there are no such um capabilities their
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
county commissioners are actually
 
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
meeting tomorrow and they're going to
 
01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
take up the request representative lane
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
we'll look into it but it's not clear to
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
me that i think that going down
 
01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
um a path where we're providing
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
different services in different counties
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
makes sense i don't know
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
um frankly i'd like to get the locations
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
in a calendar set up um before we deal
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
with that because i think we have a
 
01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
timeline and again uh there was work
 
01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:36.550 align:start position:0%
timeline and again uh there was work
done

01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:46:38.790 --> 01:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we had a website that
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
was accessible with the ability of the
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
public to make comment
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
and upload maps for our consideration
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
and i know all of us will be reviewing
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
all those maps and we're making sure
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
that staff make sure that we have in
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
hand the comments that we
 
01:46:55.590 --> 01:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
are receiving so it's part of the public
 
01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:57.910 align:start position:0%
are receiving so it's part of the public
record

01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%

01:46:57.920 --> 01:46:59.510 align:start position:0%

01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i hate to go
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
back on to the uh distribution of the
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
thumb drives but just so i'm clear and i
 
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
think everybody else is crystal clear
 
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
regarding the end user license agreement
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that they're in that agreement
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
there's no place for signatures or
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
anything like that is it is it uh mike
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
understanding that the fact that we
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
utilize that software we are agreeing to
 
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
the end user license agreement yes
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for those comments
 
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
everyone all right belknap do we have
 
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
anybody here who's from belknap county
 
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%

01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%

last time is is that uh
 
01:47:44.229 --> 01:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that'd be the best place
 
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's the most open area there's no zoom
 
01:47:49.750 --> 01:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
option there that's the most open for
 
01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
getting those people in
 
01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.109 align:start position:0%
getting those people in
okay

locations representative o'hara and
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%

you might find out as to their
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
availability for a meeting it would be
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
my pleasure madam sure thank you
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
we want to do these since and i would
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
like to get these done by mid-october
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
and i would prefer that they be tuesday
 
01:49:07.109 --> 01:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that you need to be
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
aware of is some of these places are
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
going to have a fee
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
and they will have
 
01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
um insurance requirements some of them
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
and i have been in contact with the
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
speaker's office in regards to trying to
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
figure out what we have for a budget and
 
01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
insurance and it's my understanding we
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
can deal with the insurance piece
 
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
and there is a small budget hopefully
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
people will see this uh organizations
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
will see this as
 
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
a civic event and
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
be forgiving on our fee
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
cheshire county
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
anybody here familiar with cheshire
 
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
county there's the keene public library
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
a pretty good place
 
01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
the um the library is a great room and
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
the parking is non-existent so i'm
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
i was going to suggest that
 
01:50:10.149 --> 01:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
01:50:12.390 --> 01:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
president of cheshire county my favorite
 
01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:23.270 align:start position:0%
president of cheshire county my favorite
person

01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:12.709 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
i i agree with representative porter
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
could we look at uh saint anselm's
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
institute of politics is actually in
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
your town madam chairman goss town is
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
it's a long drive to nashville if you
 
01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you um as we make these calls i
 
01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
would just remind people to ask about
 
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
the accessibility of the places to make
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
sure that they are
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
merrimack was in the merrimack county
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
admin building i'm not sure
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire yes that room is
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
still available but the county
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
delegation has been meeting in one of
 
01:52:51.119 --> 01:52:52.550 align:start position:0%
delegation has been meeting in one of
the

01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
for one of the
 
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
rooms in the old courthouse which is now
 
01:52:58.149 --> 01:52:58.159 align:start position:0%
available and i can check with the
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
county commissioners if you could
 
01:53:02.550 --> 01:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
if you could do that
 
01:53:04.709 --> 01:53:04.719 align:start position:0%
my recollection from being in the
 
01:53:07.510 --> 01:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
courtroom for work is that the old
 
01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
county courthouse is not that friendly
 
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
for access and representative lane
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
appears to be agreeing with me
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
um there is actually an elevator that
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
the last time my recollection of that
 
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
elevator is that it would be over by the
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
i never took that elevator i just went
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
right for the stairs which were
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
beautiful which are a beautiful
 
01:53:32.070 --> 01:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
staircase but
 
01:53:34.629 --> 01:53:34.639 align:start position:0%
that elevator was severely lacking and i
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
can't imagine they updated it given that
 
01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
they just built a new building
 
01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:39.109 align:start position:0%
they just built a new building
um

01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:39.119 --> 01:53:41.350 align:start position:0%
um
rockingham

01:53:41.350 --> 01:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
rockingham
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
this was at the nursing home i'm not
 
01:53:45.510 --> 01:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
sure what other facilities are available
 
01:53:47.669 --> 01:53:47.679 align:start position:0%
on the county compound there
 
01:53:51.750 --> 01:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
anybody know anything about rockingham
 
01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
all right i believe um what about the
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
um pinkerton academy they have a very
 
01:53:59.030 --> 01:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
nice spread out auditorium
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh i believe it's the performing
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
which is the name of the performing arts
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
center there's a special name for
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
stockbridge stockbridge
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll look there i think is
 
01:54:13.030 --> 01:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
pinkerton more central
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
the rockingham county complex is not
 
01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:18.719 align:start position:0%
that easy to get i mean it's roadwise
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's okay but it's sort of in the middle
 
01:54:21.669 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
of nowhere yeah i mean it's it's
 
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
rockingham's population split between
 
01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
east and west so you're kind of damned
 
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
if you do it in if you don't okay
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
um stratford now the stratfor superior
 
01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:32.719 align:start position:0%
court is definitely out in the middle of
 
01:54:36.229 --> 01:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
nowhere um representative turcotte
 
01:54:37.990 --> 01:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
i can make the contact on that one and
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh arrange the time i'm sure that will
 
01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
be available
 
01:54:44.070 --> 01:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
all right is there anything else in
 
01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
stratford that's available that is a
 
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
to i don't think so
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
i mean it's an ideal spot we use it for
 
01:54:56.550 --> 01:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh okay great access i i know it's a
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
little kind of down there's a couple
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
little turns you have to make sure you
 
01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
get there that are a little tricky
 
01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
they'll give us one of their
 
01:55:06.070 --> 01:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
will get everybody there and it really
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
is the most central
 
01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
place and if you get confused you'll end
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
up either at the jail or the nursing
 
01:55:14.550 --> 01:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
home so there's no problem all right
 
01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:17.109 align:start position:0%
home so there's no problem all right
okay

01:55:17.109 --> 01:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
and then sullivan
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
yep sugar river um valley technical
 
01:55:27.510 --> 01:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
center has two potential spots we could
 
01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
use both are decent sized rooms lots of
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
parking to tell me which weeks like
 
01:55:35.669 --> 01:55:35.679 align:start position:0%
and it's a tuesday or thursday i can
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:45.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:55:47.189 --> 01:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
what i'd like to happen over the next
 
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
week is that we try to firm this
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
the locations and the schedule
 
01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:56.870 align:start position:0%
the locations and the schedule
up

01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
as soon as anything is established we
 
01:56:04.149 --> 01:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
and once there they are established
 
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
we will need committee members to
 
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
essentially sign up representative
 
01:56:13.270 --> 01:56:13.280 align:start position:0%

01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
actually agree with uh representative
 
01:56:20.709 --> 01:56:20.719 align:start position:0%
porter that a more central location
 
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county actually makes sense
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%

this way i don't have to make a phone
call

01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
01:56:35.669 --> 01:56:35.679 align:start position:0%
thank you just for clarification are we
 
01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
asking them for one day or for two so
 
01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
the one
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
not for the one after
 
01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
the maps are drawn no because
 
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
we haven't decided how we're doing it
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
after the maps are drawn this is
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
this is very focused on accounting
 
01:56:51.669 --> 01:56:51.679 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte and just for
 
01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:53.360 align:start position:0%

01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative smith asked when
 
01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:41.350 align:start position:0%
representative smith asked when
um

01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
would like this to begin
 
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
and given the start of school and labor
 
01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
day being the sixth
 
01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
earliest week that i would think that
 
01:57:55.589 --> 01:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
this could begin would be the week of
 
01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:11.589 align:start position:0%
 
correct

01:58:11.589 --> 01:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:14.229 --> 01:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
i have no opinion on uh as to that
 
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
because i
 
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
think that if the earlier it is the the
 
01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
more we will begin examining maps in
 
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
public um given the november deadline i
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
think it would be nice for us to be to
 
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
start talking about maps actual maps
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
here certainly a month before that right
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
um so that puts us to mid october which
 
01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
means we really sort of want to get
 
01:58:37.589 --> 01:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
these loaded into september in the first
 
01:58:44.229 --> 01:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:47.350 --> 01:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
and as we noted the november 18th date
 
01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
is what we are shooting for there is the
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
ability to request the body of the house
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
to waive the rules to report out later
 
01:58:55.840 --> 01:58:58.709 align:start position:0%
to waive the rules to report out later
but

01:58:58.709 --> 01:58:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:00.870 --> 01:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
i can barely control a committee of 15 i
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
think i'd rather just be able to go
 
01:59:04.149 --> 01:59:04.159 align:start position:0%
without trying to ask for a waiver of
 
01:59:08.070 --> 01:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:11.189 --> 01:59:11.199 align:start position:0%
exactly let it be noted that today there
 
01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
was a meeting of the
 
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
special committee on redistricting in
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
the house of representatives and we were
 
01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:17.990 align:start position:0%
the house of representatives and we were
unanimous

01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
unanimous
 
01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
that is all i had on my agenda for
 
01:59:21.750 --> 01:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
business today
 
01:59:25.109 --> 01:59:25.119 align:start position:0%

01:59:26.790 --> 01:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
to where we stand on scheduling they
 
01:59:29.669 --> 01:59:29.679 align:start position:0%
will be posted on the website um the
 
01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
next meeting of this committee will be
 
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
at the call of the chair after
 
01:59:36.790 --> 01:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
um we have gone through this
 
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
joel is available he's still here um if
 
01:59:42.390 --> 01:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
you want to talk to him directly about
 
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
the maps and and try a few clicks
 
01:59:46.709 --> 01:59:46.719 align:start position:0%
yourself if he allows people to use his
 
01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
computer you can at least ask him to do
 
01:59:51.990 --> 01:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
that again joel is here as a part-time
 
01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:53.669 align:start position:0%
that again joel is here as a part-time
employee

01:59:53.669 --> 01:59:53.679 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
retained by the speaker's office in the
 
01:59:57.830 --> 01:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
general court he is non-partisan and he
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
will not be doing maps for you
 
02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative barry did you have your
 
02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:06.390 --> 02:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:13.189 --> 02:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
all in favor
 
02:00:14.709 --> 02:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's nice to just do those
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
votes without having to do the roll call
 
02:00:17.910 --> 02:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
isn't it yes
 
02:00:19.109 --> 02:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
