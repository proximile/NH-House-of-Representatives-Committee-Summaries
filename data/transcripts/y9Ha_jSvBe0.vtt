00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
well as always thank you all for being
 
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
here I'm it's uh 10 past 10 I'm going to
 
00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:26.579 align:start position:0%
convene our meeting
 
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
and as is our custom we'll begin with
 
00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:38.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
of the Republic for which it stands one
 
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
nation under God individual liberty and
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
well thank you colleagues for being here
 
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
as I've mentioned before the meeting we
 
00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
don't have a quorum but that
 
00:12:59.449 --> 00:12:59.459 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to stop us from having a
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
discussion we're simply not going to be
 
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
taking any votes unless we have a quorum
 
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:06.260 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative lean you you mentioned
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of things you'd like
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:20.590 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.310 align:start position:0%
 
s

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
s
 
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.870 align:start position:0%
s
um

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
there were some things that we had
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
decided to put off
 
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.150 align:start position:0%
decided to put off
um

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
and one of those was we call it the LLC
 
00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:35.459 align:start position:0%
I know you don't like the word loophole
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
but it's the LLC basically that's
 
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
dropped out out of courtesy I will not
 
00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:42.150 align:start position:0%
take exception to that
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:50.269 align:start position:0%
take exception to that
[Music]

00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
used in the past by both parties
 
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.949 align:start position:0%
used in the past by both parties
actually

00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:53.959 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
to get around the individual
 
00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:01.740 align:start position:0%
contribution limits so and my concern is
 
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
that we limit what corporations can give
 
00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
and we but we don't allow Partnerships
 
00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:11.220 align:start position:0%
or llc's
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
they can give everything so my question
 
00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
was do we need to bring them into the
 
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
fold and at least address that they have
 
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
there are limits that apply to them and
 
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
that they have to somehow have to
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
register and say what they're spending
 
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
in the interest of transparency
 
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
there's two questions I guess in there
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
one do we limit them three do we include
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
them do we limit them
 
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:40.019 align:start position:0%
and then do we make them report
 
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
so those are three and it's to address
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
all kinds of organizations and why are
 
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
we just singling out corporations
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
would you re would you repeat those
 
00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:53.339 align:start position:0%
three again please
 
00:14:55.569 --> 00:14:55.579 align:start position:0%
um include them
 
00:14:59.329 --> 00:14:59.339 align:start position:0%
include to include llc's
 
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
I think we've uh the Partnerships are
 
00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.150 align:start position:0%
I think we've uh the Partnerships are
excluded

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
excluded
 
00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:08.459 align:start position:0%
they can't give money at all
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
um unions can't give money
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's limited Partnerships so
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
basically I think in the in here in the
 
00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
in the 664 it talks about organizations
 
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't really Define
 
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.269 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't really Define
organizations

00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
and in most
 
00:15:28.199 --> 00:15:30.350 align:start position:0%
and in most
parts

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
parts
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
of the law organizations includes
 
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
all kinds of entities so it would be
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
corporations limited partners anything
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
that can be quote a person underneath
 
00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:44.579 align:start position:0%
the law so for instance if you look at
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
corporate law
 
00:15:48.889 --> 00:15:48.899 align:start position:0%
and that's part of what citizens united
 
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
was about was corporations are persons
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
so if a corporation is a person why is
 
00:15:58.129 --> 00:15:58.139 align:start position:0%
there any reason not to include these
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
other entities at least so that we know
 
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
what they're doing and if we want limits
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
on them to put them in
 
00:16:09.769 --> 00:16:09.779 align:start position:0%
and we haven't really talked about that
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
because we've been focusing on other
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
things and we had agreed to kind of wait
 
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
till the end
 
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
so I think I've articulated it you know
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
consistency and to be sure that
 
00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:26.459 align:start position:0%
um that if there are known ways that
 
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
people are getting around the limits
 
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
that we at least deter them in some way
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
or make it I think somebody said it once
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
make it at least a little more difficult
 
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
for them to do that and that it's in
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
plain sight so that people can see it
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
and see what's happening
 
00:16:44.279 --> 00:17:04.189 align:start position:0%
and see what's happening
okay

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:39.539 align:start position:0%
if and if you look at business
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
organization is to find it's on the top
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
of 223
 
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
of the book I don't know
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
um it it's
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
664 right two in the definitions Roman
 
00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:57.419 align:start position:0%
numeral xbi right to mean any
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
Corporation partnership limited
 
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
liability company proprietorship so we
 
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
defined here but we don't have the word
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
just organization I don't think defined
 
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
uh it is it is defined in here but I'm
 
00:18:18.529 --> 00:18:18.539 align:start position:0%
going to find it okay good but but it's
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
not a definition I think is very useful
 
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
when I find it I'll read it to you and
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
tell you why I think that
 
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.549 align:start position:0%
tell you why I think that
uh

00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
because one of the reasons I think when
 
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
we had our initial discussions we talked
 
00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:36.620 align:start position:0%
about defining person as a human being
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
and then we talked about having
 
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
organization mean everything else but
 
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
that was way at the beginning when we
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
I've got to find it okay it basically uh
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of one of these
 
00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
sections or paragraphs or Clauses
 
00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:00.299 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it it defines
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
this is kind of it's kind of a separate
 
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
issue but I I just kind of see an
 
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
organization consisting of one person
 
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.390 align:start position:0%
organization consisting of one person
that

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
well an LLC is an organization that can
 
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
have single member and frankly that's a
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
lot of small businesses in New Hampshire
 
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
but yeah it it's Crea it's a personal
 
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
it's an entity with one member and it's
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
being done to protect them from
 
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.650 align:start position:0%
being done to protect them from
liability

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
liability
 
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
right and it's defined and it's included
 
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
under business organization
 
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
so that that was one minor let me find
 
00:20:09.289 --> 00:20:09.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
all right and it always seems longer
 
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
when you think people are waiting too
 
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.090 align:start position:0%
when you think people are waiting too
[Laughter]

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
uh here we are I found it
 
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:37.490 align:start position:0%
uh here we are I found it
uh

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:40.100 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
664 colon 2 Roman numeral three
 
00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
political committee means right it's a
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph after
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh part e
 
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
just above the Roman numeral four as
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
used in this paragraph
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
organization includes but is not limited
 
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:01.850 align:start position:0%
organization includes but is not limited
to

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:09.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:12.169 --> 00:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
entities formed under the law
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
what a more natural one or more natural
 
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.669 align:start position:0%
what a more natural one or more natural
persons

00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
persons
 
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
semicolon entities formed under state
 
00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.330 align:start position:0%
semicolon entities formed under state
law

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:22.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
except those entities qualified under
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
Section 501c3
 
00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:31.220 align:start position:0%
uh committees formed by a candidate
 
00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
well it does include the LLC elsewhere
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
explicitly under business organization
 
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
and it also says entities
 
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
formed under state law which I think
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
would also include an LLC that has no
 
00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
existence except under state law so then
 
00:21:59.810 --> 00:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
we have so this is kind of an aside from
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
your main point but
 
00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me that
 
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
where it says one or more natural
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
persons it would make more sense to me
 
00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:15.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.649 --> 00:22:18.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
except how can you put your microphone
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
on please I think in the in the marked
 
00:22:24.169 --> 00:22:24.179 align:start position:0%
up draft from the Secretary of State
 
00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
they did change it to two oh okay I
 
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:28.940 align:start position:0%
haven't well
 
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:37.010 align:start position:0%
is that
includes

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
well that one of that is because we
 
00:22:42.649 --> 00:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
we were talking about the term includes
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes it said let Aaron speak to
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
this when she gets here but I guess part
 
00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
of me is entities formed under the state
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
law there are corporations that have
 
00:22:54.409 --> 00:22:54.419 align:start position:0%
single numbers and there are llc's that
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
have single members so
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
then are we limiting the corporations to
 
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
only those that have more than one
 
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.190 align:start position:0%
only those that have more than one
shareholder

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
shareholder
 
00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
I don't think so because and and then an
 
00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.710 align:start position:0%
I don't think so because and and then an
entity

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
entity
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
an entity formed under state law would
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
include an LLC which was the focus of
 
00:23:20.049 --> 00:23:20.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
and it also included explicitly
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
elsewhere under business organization
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
right what what my change would do would
 
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
mean that we're not confusing an
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
activity by a single individual natural
 
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.049 align:start position:0%
activity by a single individual natural
person

00:23:36.049 --> 00:23:36.059 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
with an organization
 
00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
correct but I I think this definition
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that but maybe I'm misreading
 
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.669 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that but maybe I'm misreading
it

00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
because we we were talking about because
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
what's strict what would it what was was
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
is it the but not limited to that was
 
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
struck it says includes changes
 
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
if if you read it without that uh
 
00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.049 align:start position:0%
if if you read it without that uh
parenthesis

00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:00.059 align:start position:0%
parenthesis
 
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
Clause set off by commas but is not
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
limited to includes one or more natural
 
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.909 align:start position:0%
limited to includes one or more natural
persons

00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
persons
 
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
to me that it's not part of the
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
what almost anybody my opinion of course
 
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
right I think I think we can ask about
 
00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.470 align:start position:0%
right I think I think we can ask about
because

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
political committee is two people
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
correct they get together
 
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
so that wouldn't be right any
 
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
organization of two or more persons but
 
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
a single individual by by my definition
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
can't be an organization right and
 
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
that's fine and then we've got then
 
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
right it would be any entity that's a
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't mean to be
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
interrupting your
 
00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.250 align:start position:0%
interrupting your
so

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.330 --> 00:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
two or more natural persons
 
00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.710 align:start position:0%
two or more natural persons
yeah

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059 align:start position:0%
and there that defines organization not
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
business organ it's the same way yeah
 
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
and we had talked about they're
 
00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
and I see that representative Ward is
 
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
correct of course that the draft that we
 
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
just received from
 
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary Hennessey
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
also would suggest the same change
 
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.010 align:start position:0%
also would suggest the same change
but

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
I didn't mean to digress from your main
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
focused there but that was right so I I
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
guess I'm still trying to I guess one
 
00:25:36.529 --> 00:25:36.539 align:start position:0%
question we can ask is do we need the
 
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
term business organization as well as
 
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
this and maybe we do maybe we don't and
 
00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.230 align:start position:0%
this and maybe we do maybe we don't and
then

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
um oh
 
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
why are we including some entities but
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
it looks like these were including
 
00:25:57.049 --> 00:25:57.059 align:start position:0%
entities but we're are we still
 
00:25:57.059 --> 00:26:00.049 align:start position:0%
entities but we're are we still
excluding

00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:00.059 align:start position:0%
excluding
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
is there a way for conflict because we
 
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
have another provision over here that
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
talks about people that can't give right
 
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
and then we exclude those
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned unions yes uh
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
and that goes back to 1999 that case in
 
00:26:21.169 --> 00:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
19 minutes and I
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
strongly suspect from past discussions
 
00:26:26.409 --> 00:26:26.419 align:start position:0%
we've had on this committee that
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
allowing unions as an entity to
 
00:26:30.169 --> 00:26:30.179 align:start position:0%
contribute is something that would
 
00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
require a great deal of discussion and
 
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:35.220 align:start position:0%
debate if we were ever to it was ever to
 
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
be agreed we have to defer that one
 
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
until the next I think that's one we
 
00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.649 align:start position:0%
until the next I think that's one we
would

00:26:39.649 --> 00:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:42.419 align:start position:0%
practically speaking would defer yeah
 
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
yeah is that as I've mentioned I think
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
we all agree with this we're looking for
 
00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:47.940 align:start position:0%
the areas we can you know I'll agree on
 
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.909 align:start position:0%
the areas we can you know I'll agree on
right

00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:26:59.149 --> 00:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.649 --> 00:27:03.659 align:start position:0%
and I I can think of arguments against
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
allowing unions as an entity to
 
00:27:06.769 --> 00:27:06.779 align:start position:0%
contribute but I'm not going to go into
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
them we'll save that for the day we have
 
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
is when we put in
 
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.330 align:start position:0%
is when we put in
limits

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
limits
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
is it is the limit approach applicable
 
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
only to corporations or is it applicable
 
00:27:36.769 --> 00:27:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.649 --> 00:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
so right now we have an existing piece
 
00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
of the statute
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
and I think it's Roman numeral number
 
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.510 align:start position:0%
and I think it's Roman numeral number
four

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
or whatever but puts a limit on what
 
00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:49.700 align:start position:0%
individuals and corporations can give
 
00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
but it corporations is the only business
 
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
entity that is limited in that regard as
 
00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
to amount
 
00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.430 align:start position:0%
to amount
so

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
my question is why do we do that just
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
with that one entity and I guess if the
 
00:28:11.529 --> 00:28:11.539 align:start position:0%
statute is silent then does that mean
 
00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:15.539 align:start position:0%
the other entities can give unlimited
 
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
amounts because they're not listed
 
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
anywhere that I know of I'm happy to be
 
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.970 align:start position:0%
anywhere that I know of I'm happy to be
corrected

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh we will be asking for your input at
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
some point
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:36.769 --> 00:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:42.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:54.769 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:54.779 --> 00:29:02.630 align:start position:0%
 
Instagram

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
I should know it by heart at this size
 
00:29:06.529 --> 00:29:06.539 align:start position:0%
664 4.
 
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
so on page 226 and it's been amended
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
already again since this one but Roman
 
00:29:18.409 --> 00:29:18.419 align:start position:0%
numeral four has not been amended and
 
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
right and that states uh right
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
by a person
 
00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:27.419 align:start position:0%
that that's that's the uh this is 664
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
colon 4 Roman numeral four and it's what
 
00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:33.059 align:start position:0%
sets the contribution limits right by a
 
00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
personal Corporation right so and then
 
00:29:45.889 --> 00:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
business organizations I think and then
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
five is the one that the next thing I
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
want to talk about but that was changed
 
00:29:57.289 --> 00:29:57.299 align:start position:0%
by the senate in our budget but let's
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
put that off for now but so so my
 
00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:02.700 align:start position:0%
question is in Roman numeral four do we
 
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
want to say by a person or business
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
organization an access of the following
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
amounts in other words why are we do why
 
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
are we differentiating between a
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:21.529 --> 00:30:21.539 align:start position:0%
because right now I think they're
 
00:30:21.539 --> 00:30:37.669 align:start position:0%
because right now I think they're
Unlimited

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
nor do you right
 
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
I I don't I think the reasoning goes
 
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
back to the case in 1999 and there and
 
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
limited liability companies were not as
 
00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:54.779 align:start position:0%
big a thing in 1999 as they are now I
 
00:30:57.409 --> 00:30:57.419 align:start position:0%
mean historically I think I think in I
 
00:30:59.630 --> 00:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
think the first time they were enacted
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm doing this totally from memory
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
so it's probably gonna be wrong but I
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
think it was around 1995.
 
00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:09.419 align:start position:0%
and they kind of came into bow
 
00:31:11.889 --> 00:31:11.899 align:start position:0%
over those following 10 years
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
and as a as a preferred method of
 
00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
setting up a business entity because it
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
allowed I'm going to get really into the
 
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
weeds here it allows pass-through
 
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
taxation you're not taxed twice and so
 
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
the corporation doesn't pay taxes and
 
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
then the individuals so it eliminates
 
00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
that double taxation so a lot of
 
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
business people like to use them
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
makes sense because it's a pass-through
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
entity so they're not paying as much
 
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.930 align:start position:0%
entity so they're not paying as much
taxes

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.510 align:start position:0%
taxes
so

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
it kind of came into so I think that's
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
one reason why it's kind of not been in
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
here is when it originally this was
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
originally changed was in 1999 I don't
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
think anybody's ever really looked at it
 
00:31:57.169 --> 00:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
and then when we started talking about
 
00:31:58.510 --> 00:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
LLCs that were being formed and how they
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
were contributing millions of dollars to
 
00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
some campaigns both Democrat and
 
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:08.870 align:start position:0%
some campaigns both Democrat and
Republican

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
Republican
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
um how do we put at least disclose that
 
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
and how and if we want to put a limit on
 
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
the way we're limiting corporations why
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
don't we limit them as well
 
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
so again that's a two-prong question
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
do we include them and if we do do we
 
00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:27.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.289 --> 00:32:30.299 align:start position:0%
and you know maybe we do need to talk
 
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
about that in the next
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
cycle but I to me it's it doesn't make
 
00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
sense and it's part of the history but
 
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
it's not been brought up I think by
 
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
either the Secretary of State or the AG
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
because it's not really something and
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
Aaron can correct me if I'm wrong I
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
don't think it's something that comes up
 
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
to them but to me it's from a
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
transparency standpoint and where we
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
want to do do we want to have them be as
 
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:00.059 align:start position:0%
transparent as the corporations I mean
 
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
why should they not have to be as
 
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
transparent as the other business
 
00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:06.049 align:start position:0%
transparent as the other business
entities

00:33:06.049 --> 00:33:06.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.059 --> 00:33:10.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.310 align:start position:0%
that's all
um

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
and I think and I know that one concern
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
we had was does the does the benefit of
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
transparency outweigh the cost of the
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
people complying and I think with
 
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
many llc's I because of the amount of
 
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
money that is being contributed
 
00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
it's significant so I think in my
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
opinion to benefit outweighs the costs
 
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
and if an entity if an LL small LLC
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
wants to give money then they can give
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
money but then they just have to whoever
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
they give it to has to disclose it and
 
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
then they have to disclose it
 
00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:52.019 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
whoever they're giving the money to has
 
00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
but should there be a limit to that I
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
my thought is if we're limiting
 
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
corporations why aren't we limiting
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer I'm not a lawyer and
 
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
it's probably but but when I
 
00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:34.820 align:start position:0%
when I read
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
664 colon for Roman numeral four
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
by a person or Corporation
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
see I as a as a layperson in the legal
 
00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.129 align:start position:0%
see I as a as a layperson in the legal
field

00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:46.139 align:start position:0%
field
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
I would interpret Corporation as
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
including an LLC
 
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't no okay that's more your no
 
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't which is why it's listed
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
separately you know in other places and
 
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
I I mean that we can ask the AG but I
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
don't think that they would
 
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
okay I don't think from a legal
 
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
standpoint because there's a whole
 
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
group of statutes that deal with
 
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
corporations and then there's a whole
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
group of statutes that deal with LLC so
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
they're treated very differently
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the law
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
so I think if we were going to have to I
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
and I would
 
00:35:34.609 --> 00:35:34.619 align:start position:0%
need to have more information and more
 
00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
have given a lot more thought before I
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
was ready to
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
agree if ever to such a change
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
I I one bit of information that would be
 
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
helpful to have and considering this is
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
to know
 
00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:53.339 align:start position:0%
how much
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
how often this occurs
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
and as as we've discussed between us in
 
00:36:05.089 --> 00:36:05.099 align:start position:0%
the past I'm not
 
00:36:05.099 --> 00:36:06.170 align:start position:0%
the past I'm not
uh

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not convinced that contribution
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
limits in principle are necessarily
 
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.329 align:start position:0%
limits in principle are necessarily
uh

00:36:13.329 --> 00:36:13.339 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
acceptable or effective
 
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.290 align:start position:0%
acceptable or effective
uh

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
in the interest of transparency if
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
candidates are required to disclose
 
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
receipts which they are passed Beyond a
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
total of a thousand right
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
if you received
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
no a candidate as a candidate is
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
required to register and make reports if
 
00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:42.140 align:start position:0%
expenditures exceed one thousand
 
00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
political committees including candidate
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
committees I believe are required to
 
00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:51.380 align:start position:0%
register and Report when it's
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
receipts or expenditures
 
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.569 align:start position:0%
receipts or expenditures
right

00:36:56.569 --> 00:36:56.579 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
so I think in the interest of
 
00:36:59.810 --> 00:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
transparency having the candidate
 
00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.370 align:start position:0%
transparency having the candidate
reporting

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
this information
 
00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
but that's again that's
 
00:37:13.609 --> 00:37:13.619 align:start position:0%
subject of discussion right so I I
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
understand you're concern about
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
contribution limits as as we've
 
00:37:20.329 --> 00:37:20.339 align:start position:0%
discussed in the past between us
 
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
I'm not as concerned about that as
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
about the establishing limits
 
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
the contribution limits you mean you're
 
00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
not as just I'm not as concerned as some
 
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
people that there be contributions
 
00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.250 align:start position:0%
people that there be contributions
I

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
do agree that transparency requires that
 
00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
Beyond some threshold we understand
 
00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
where candidates
 
00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
campaign financing is coming from
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
so as the Secretary of State stated in
 
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
are meeting with them in this room
 
00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:55.380 align:start position:0%
so we the voters can judge if they think
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
there's undo the possibility of undue
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
influence going on that that I agree
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.069 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
in any case even candidates when their
 
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
expenditures exceed a thousand dollars
 
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
they are responsible to report receipts
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
and expenditures
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
as I understand it back to the elect
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
back to the beginning of that election
 
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
cycle yeah and I think so yeah and I
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
think part of part of the problems on
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
the transparency piece is that
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
the names of these organizations
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
don't really disclose who is giving the
 
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
money so you say ABC you know ABC LLC
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say who is behind a ABC
 
00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:44.099 align:start position:0%
all you know is that name and when you
 
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
go and look them up in the Secretary of
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
State's office there are no names that
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
just gives so there are no names that
 
00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
just gives the names of some some of the
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
key members perhaps but not
 
00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:01.380 align:start position:0%
but not names not individual names so
 
00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
it's it's transparent in the sense that
 
00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
you are learning
 
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
you are learning the names of who's
 
00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
giving but the name itself doesn't
 
00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
really get you anywhere because
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's not telling you much
 
00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
so I think that's one and the same is
 
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
true corporations but we won't put that
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
aside for now
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
because at least you have the some of
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
the things are listed in a lot of the
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
corporations you can get to but LLCs are
 
00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
a little trickier
 
00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
it's it's more apparent transparency
 
00:39:35.569 --> 00:39:35.579 align:start position:0%
than real transparency correct
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
from my perspective that's a discussion
 
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
we would need to defer to another okay
 
00:39:44.089 --> 00:39:44.099 align:start position:0%
well I'll hold you to it not I don't
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
think it's something we're going to be
 
00:39:47.569 --> 00:39:47.579 align:start position:0%
able to to agree on here to agree on in
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
within this subcommittee okay so and I
 
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
I'm still convinced there's plenty we
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
will be able to agree on that we'll be
 
00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
in them will be improvements to the
 
00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.069 align:start position:0%
in them will be improvements to the
current

00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
status we'll refer that to the next
 
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.810 align:start position:0%
status we'll refer that to the next
subcommittee

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
or the next legislator who wishes to
 
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
file okay
 
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay legislative service request right
 
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.870 align:start position:0%
okay legislative service request right
yeah

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
what happened in the budget
 
00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:23.270 align:start position:0%
what happened in the budget
and

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
um when the Senate put in hb2 the
 
00:40:31.609 --> 00:40:31.619 align:start position:0%
provision that packs and it's in Roman
 
00:40:34.609 --> 00:40:34.619 align:start position:0%
numeral five of that same bill 664 for
 
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
the same statute rather
 
00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
that now packs are limit Unlimited
 
00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
so when we read it
 
00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
in our book right now it says a total of
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand and right now it's been
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
changed to to Unlimited
 
00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:58.250 align:start position:0%
changed to to Unlimited
and

00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
I'm just bringing it up because it was
 
00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
never just brought before us we never
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
had any public
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
hearing on it it just got added on to
 
00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.130 align:start position:0%
hearing on it it just got added on to
the

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
Bill and do we want to at least talk
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
about it maybe not maybe the
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is not the right place but
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to at least have a
 
00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
conversation about it because it's
 
00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
something that's happened since we
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
it's all right it was a Roman numeral
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
five and 664 call
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
colon 4.
 
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
it previously read that uh prohibited
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
contribution by any candidate committee
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
non-candidate political committee or
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
political advocacy organization in
 
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
excess of the following amounts and
 
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
contributed to a candidate or candidate
 
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
committee was limited to
 
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
10 000 during each of the phases of a
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
typical election cycle
 
00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.490 align:start position:0%
typical election cycle
uh

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
but here the what they called here
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
exploratory phase and right primary and
 
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
general election now it's Unlimited in
 
00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
each phase
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
and the previous total limit per
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
election cycle of 30 000 is now
 
00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:28.790 align:start position:0%
election cycle of 30 000 is now
Unlimited

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
I had a thought related to this but not
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
not really going along the lines you're
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
another another topic we should discuss
 
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
at some point maybe maybe we'll uh draw
 
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
up drafts of our ideas
 
00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
a topic that I think is related to this
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
because of the listing of different
 
00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:51.320 align:start position:0%
types of political
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
organizations we're talking about
 
00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.569 align:start position:0%
organizations we're talking about
simplifying

00:42:56.569 --> 00:42:56.579 align:start position:0%
simplifying
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
the number of different political
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
and the different political committees
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
as near as I can tell are just as we're
 
00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
calling them different types they're
 
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
distinguished by
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh reporting thresholds primarily
 
00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.329 align:start position:0%
uh reporting thresholds primarily
uh

00:43:14.329 --> 00:43:14.339 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:14.339 --> 00:43:17.450 align:start position:0%
uh
and

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
just the thought I had for example I
 
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
don't see a difference a real meaningful
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
difference between a political
 
00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579 align:start position:0%
advocacy organ generally a political
 
00:43:26.579 --> 00:43:28.130 align:start position:0%
advocacy organ generally a political
committee

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
I mean there's a threshold there's a
 
00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:30.900 align:start position:0%
threshold at which they have to start
 
00:43:32.329 --> 00:43:32.339 align:start position:0%
reporting but
 
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
why are they distinguished
 
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
I could be incorrect but are ended in
 
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
like uh 501 C4s there are entities that
 
00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:50.510 align:start position:0%
like uh 501 C4s there are entities that
are

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:51.349 align:start position:0%
are
um

00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:54.980 align:start position:0%
that do do they're not 501c3s they're
 
00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
501c4s and they do political advocacy so
 
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
maybe their primary goal is not
 
00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:04.390 align:start position:0%
maybe their primary goal is not
um

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:08.900 align:start position:0%
to uh I'm trying to think of an example
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
maybe their primary goal is not to quote
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
Lobby or you know but they do a portion
 
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
of that and so they do political
 
00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.329 align:start position:0%
of that and so they do political
advocacy

00:44:20.329 --> 00:44:20.339 align:start position:0%
advocacy
 
00:44:23.329 --> 00:44:23.339 align:start position:0%
but they're not tent and I agree with
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
you I think that they're a kind of a
 
00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
political committee and they wanted
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
people wanted to be clear that they were
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
included in political committees and
 
00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
they should they set a different
 
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.569 align:start position:0%
they should they set a different
threshold

00:44:35.569 --> 00:44:35.579 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:38.660 align:start position:0%
I you know we passed a bill that
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
decreased the threshold and put in some
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
new Provisions this past year but
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
if we're going to just talk about one
 
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
definition when we go through these
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
definitions with the deputy secretary
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
then let's I agree I think we need to
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
look at all of these and that's and
 
00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
that's why I said when we changed some
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
of the definitions that's one reason I
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to put the thing in word form so
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
we could go through and find every time
 
00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
that it's mentioned so that we can catch
 
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
it and figure out what else needed to be
 
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.030 align:start position:0%
it and figure out what else needed to be
changed

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
not because it's a you know because it's
 
00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
in that group of things that we've
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
agreed on does that make sense
 
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
I think so
 
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
yes yeah it doesn't make sense I agree
 
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:25.140 align:start position:0%
with you we need to look at that too
 
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
getting back to my was originally saying
 
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
about Roman numeral five currently
 
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
candidate committee non-candidate
 
00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
political committee or political
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization
 
00:45:38.809 --> 00:45:38.819 align:start position:0%
uh we've talked previously about the
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
distinction between someone who
 
00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
files as a candidate
 
00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
versus someone who files as you know
 
00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
with a candidate committee
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
and I I do think that's a meaningful
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
distinction because a candidate
 
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
committee at the
 
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
as I understand the current definition
 
00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:01.380 align:start position:0%
it requires somebody find somebody else
 
00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
what's the difference without a
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
distinction and they have different
 
00:46:10.609 --> 00:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
reporting things too
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
right and on that General topic I think
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
it would make sense to I want to retain
 
00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
the distinction because I think
 
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
you may laugh at this but I know people
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
who've run for uh State Rep for example
 
00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:26.450 align:start position:0%
who've run for uh State Rep for example
uh

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
who considered having to find someone
 
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
else willing to accept
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
the task of managing the finances
 
00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
the campaign
 
00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
it was not
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
something that was easy for them to do
 
00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:43.940 align:start position:0%
everybody's busy
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
we've all got lots of things to do
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh every member of the public including
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
those for taking the time to be here
 
00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:55.670 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
that's why that's what's behind my
 
00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:02.300 align:start position:0%
belief we should retain the distinction
 
00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
it's a low barrier to participation you
 
00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
just show up your file as yourself right
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
you declare yourself your own Fiscal
 
00:47:11.089 --> 00:47:11.099 align:start position:0%
Agent and you're off and running you
 
00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
don't have to go round up somebody else
 
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
even though you may have many supporters
 
00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
it's a different
 
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:21.530 align:start position:0%
it's a different
uh

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.569 --> 00:47:23.579 align:start position:0%
just that's one reason I prefer to keep
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
the distinction
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
but and this art this Roman numeral five
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
by any candidate committee Etc
 
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
we could reduce the Practical
 
00:47:35.809 --> 00:47:35.819 align:start position:0%
differences between the two right by
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
adding the you know candidate in that
 
00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.829 align:start position:0%
adding the you know candidate in that
list

00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:47:44.329 --> 00:47:44.339 align:start position:0%
there's uh the amount to contribute the
 
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
the max amount you can contribute to a
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
candidate or candidate committee to a
 
00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:49.980 align:start position:0%
non-candidate political committee or
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
political advocacy add the word
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
candidate at the beginning candidate
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
comma candidate committee and then we're
 
00:47:58.730 --> 00:47:58.740 align:start position:0%
treating those two yeah the same I need
 
00:47:59.809 --> 00:47:59.819 align:start position:0%
to think about
 
00:47:59.819 --> 00:48:02.569 align:start position:0%
to think about
it yeah

00:48:02.569 --> 00:48:02.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:09.740 align:start position:0%
also non-candidate political committee
 
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
and again what maybe we could talk about
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
this again after we go through some of
 
00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
the changes that the deputy secretary
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
because I think she made some changes in
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
those definitions and we can look at
 
00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.130 align:start position:0%
those definitions and we can look at
those

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
yeah we
 
00:48:26.569 --> 00:48:26.579 align:start position:0%
I just was a thought I had yeah no I
 
00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
agree or maybe we could
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:40.740 align:start position:0%
how a candidate committee is defined
 
00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:42.349 align:start position:0%
how a candidate committee is defined
right

00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:44.220 align:start position:0%
do we need
 
00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
and do we need do we need a candidate
 
00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:47.270 align:start position:0%
and do we need do we need a candidate
committee

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
in there maybe we
 
00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
I think we do because for the larger
 
00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
races that's true okay no yep I I'm not
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
trying to cut you off but uh yeah yeah I
 
00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
think for the larger races we need to
 
00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
have it but again for that Moana the
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
house raises
 
00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
I mean I I don't do a candidate
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
committee so yeah I don't either but I
 
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
think a lot of them don't but I think
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
we can clarify that and make the
 
00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements the same so in
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
essence there's not that much difference
 
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
I I think we could make the uh reporting
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
requirements the same I think that's an
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
obvious thing to change we could all
 
00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
agree on in terms of the dates
 
00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
on which the reports have to be filed
 
00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
and and so on
 
00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
uh maybe it'd be a simple
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
in whatever this definition we have of
 
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
candidate committee that it allows the
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
candidate to be
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
his or her own Fiscal Agent
 
00:49:47.329 --> 00:49:47.339 align:start position:0%
maybe it would be that simple
 
00:49:47.339 --> 00:49:48.710 align:start position:0%
maybe it would be that simple
right

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
so what else do you have in your mind to
 
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
discuss that was it okay I'm good for
 
00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
the for the benefit of this public
 
00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.390 align:start position:0%
the for the benefit of this public
portion

00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
portion
 
00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh you know for actual public meeting
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna
 
00:50:05.089 --> 00:50:05.099 align:start position:0%
uh reiterate what I was saying about a
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
basic plan for how to proceed from here
 
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
which is that
 
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.150 align:start position:0%
which is that
uh

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:13.140 align:start position:0%
we will plan on wrapping up the
 
00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
activities of this subcommittee in late
 
00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.870 align:start position:0%
activities of this subcommittee in late
August

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
August
 
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
with a meeting in which a draft or
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
drafts of a report of the subcommittee
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
are presented to the full subcommittee
 
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
for them to uh to discuss with them and
 
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
to liberate over
 
00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:34.380 align:start position:0%
and either approve or suggest
 
00:50:38.089 --> 00:50:38.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
and that will conclude the work of the
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to
 
00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.430 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to
uh

00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
remove the possibility that people could
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
confuse our legislative duties in
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
preparing legislative service requests
 
00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:52.859 align:start position:0%
and so on with the activities of the
 
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
subcommittee because we would then again
 
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
be free to collaborate on whatever level
 
00:50:59.450 --> 00:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
right as legislators because we're no
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
longer members of a public this specific
 
00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
public body
 
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
and that makes sense to both of you
 
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
right yes and I will and since this is a
 
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
purely administrative matter I will
 
00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
confer with our
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
our other two members or other three
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
members who get their concurrence with
 
00:51:23.329 --> 00:51:23.339 align:start position:0%
that schedule okay
 
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
all righty uh I note that we have a
 
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative of the Secretary of
 
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
State's office here Deputy Hennessey
 
00:51:35.569 --> 00:51:35.579 align:start position:0%
and if you'd like to give us a quick a
 
00:51:38.569 --> 00:51:38.579 align:start position:0%
quick overview of your rough draft
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
and if you would just state your name
 
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:51:49.069 --> 00:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
record thank you Mr chair committee
 
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
Aaron Hennessey deputy secretary of
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
state and
 
00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:56.220 align:start position:0%
um what I have given out is a very rough
 
00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
draft it's about 20
 
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
six pages long it includes all of the
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
current version of 664. and the way you
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
can read it is that
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
um anything in red bold is what I've
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
added to the language of 664. I've done
 
00:52:14.569 --> 00:52:14.579 align:start position:0%
strikethroughs which would be
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
recommended deletions of the statute
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
anything in highlights or in blue text
 
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
it still needs to be addressed
 
00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:26.089 align:start position:0%
it still needs to be addressed
um

00:52:26.089 --> 00:52:26.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:29.089 --> 00:52:29.099 align:start position:0%
and or there's open questions for
 
00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:31.220 align:start position:0%
someone else to answer
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
and what I've tried to do is to make it
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
as simple as possible I haven't tried to
 
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
include anything which I think may be
 
00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:41.089 align:start position:0%
include anything which I think may be
considered

00:52:41.089 --> 00:52:41.099 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:43.140 align:start position:0%
um political in any way just to try and
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
simplify anything make it much easier
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
hopefully to understand
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
I've tried to clear up registering
 
00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:53.420 align:start position:0%
versus reporting
 
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
I've tried to Define what a political
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
committee is and condense down the
 
00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.049 align:start position:0%
committee is and condense down the
language

00:53:00.049 --> 00:53:00.059 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:53:02.329 --> 00:53:02.339 align:start position:0%
I've tried to Define what an election
 
00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:06.839 align:start position:0%
cycle is versus what it was put in there
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
in the current version and then for the
 
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
election cycle I've TR I've because I
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of discussion and agreement
 
00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:16.740 align:start position:0%
from your committee deleted out the
 
00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:18.109 align:start position:0%
from your committee deleted out the
different

00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:53:20.809 --> 00:53:20.819 align:start position:0%
um campaign contribution limits for the
 
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:23.220 align:start position:0%
three different current cycles of the
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
election cycle and just make it one
 
00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
cycle and one limit
 
00:53:30.049 --> 00:53:30.059 align:start position:0%
um I've gotten rid of the word Fiscal
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
Agent or agent and just used the word
 
00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
Treasurer just because they all do the
 
00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:36.740 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
I've tried to
 
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:41.750 align:start position:0%
I've tried to
um

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
be as inclusive as I could of things
 
00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
that I've heard from your conversations
 
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
from the ages conversations from
 
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
questions that I've gotten
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
um but it's it doesn't have everything
 
00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
possible I don't think and every time I
 
00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
read through it I think of something
 
00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
else to change or recognize something so
 
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
this is the first draft first attempt
 
00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to go through it very quickly
 
00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:09.380 align:start position:0%
just to highlight some of the the major
 
00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
recommended changes if if you would like
 
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
me to do that Mr chair well I'd be would
 
00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
be happy to hear that okay great thank
 
00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
you let me put my reading glasses on
 
00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
okay so first off I've included the
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
language from any bills from 2023 that
 
00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
have passed that includes HB 195 and the
 
00:54:30.609 --> 00:54:30.619 align:start position:0%
hb2 language
 
00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
in the definition section uh because
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
this had a lot of discussion around it
 
00:54:41.809 --> 00:54:41.819 align:start position:0%
under 664 to colon 3
 
00:54:41.819 --> 00:54:43.190 align:start position:0%
under 664 to colon 3
um

00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
I've put the definition of a political
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
committee and included all of the other
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
committee types that we've previously
 
00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
discussed in the current
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
6664 candidate committee is not defined
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
so now we have it is that instead of
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
breaking out different types of
 
00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
political committees and definitions it
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
says types of political committees
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
include candidate Committee created by a
 
00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
candidate running for office non-candid
 
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
committee and so on so it's it's more
 
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
whenever the word political committee is
 
00:55:20.329 --> 00:55:20.339 align:start position:0%
used in in the statute you can refer
 
00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:21.900 align:start position:0%
back and see that's what that means
 
00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:25.140 align:start position:0%
except if it after the words political
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
committee it says excluding this type of
 
00:55:32.569 --> 00:55:32.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:33.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
you'll see on on page three there's some
 
00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:38.150 align:start position:0%
you'll see on on page three there's some
highlights

00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
highlights
 
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
um and this is
 
00:55:42.829 --> 00:55:42.839 align:start position:0%
this is very um
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's what you would have found if you
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
read 664 through is that sometimes
 
00:55:47.809 --> 00:55:47.819 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of internal
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies for example post office
 
00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:52.970 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies for example post office
address

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:55:55.609 --> 00:55:55.619 align:start position:0%
shall not mean an individual's business
 
00:55:58.490 --> 00:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
address but then when you go down to
 
00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:01.380 align:start position:0%
principal pace place of business it asks
 
00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
you to to include the post office
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
address so there's there's some things
 
00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
that need to be cleared up
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
um also occupation means an individual's
 
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
official job title but then when you
 
00:56:17.809 --> 00:56:17.819 align:start position:0%
have to report receipts you have to put
 
00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
somebody's occupation and their job
 
00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
title so some some things still need to
 
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
be cleared up and that I would leave it
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
to the legislature to decide what it is
 
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
that's important that you information
 
00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
that you need
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
um and and what what are you looking for
 
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:35.700 align:start position:0%
for a post office address are you
 
00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
looking for a physical address
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
um so there's there's some additions
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
that can be done
 
00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.730 align:start position:0%
that can be done
um

00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:43.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
I defined election cycle and This this
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
term is going to be used when you're
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at how much money
 
00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
someone can collect and in what time
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
period and there was a lot of discussion
 
00:56:59.329 --> 00:56:59.339 align:start position:0%
previously that your committee had about
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
how long can somebody go on with a
 
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
deficit in their um in their reporting
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
how long can somebody maintain a surplus
 
00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
so the way I've defined it is that an
 
00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
election cycle means the period of time
 
00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
beginning on the eighth day after a
 
00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
state general election through seven
 
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
days after the next general election
 
00:57:23.809 --> 00:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
so any expenditures or receipts that you
 
00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
have in that time would be
 
00:57:28.849 --> 00:57:28.859 align:start position:0%
in that election cycle and then the
 
00:57:35.089 --> 00:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.609 --> 00:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you recall in the
 
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
current version of 664 it has very
 
00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
complicated reporting paragraphs so on
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
page 12 I've
 
00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:48.780 align:start position:0%
um I've tried to take it down to bullet
 
00:57:51.290 --> 00:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
points of when each report is due and
 
00:57:53.569 --> 00:57:53.579 align:start position:0%
currently reports are different for
 
00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
candidates versus political committees
 
00:57:58.370 --> 00:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
on when the reports are due but I've
 
00:57:59.809 --> 00:57:59.819 align:start position:0%
just said that
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
everyone has to report according to the
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
schedule and it's more of a bullet point
 
00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
schedule so
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
um it def the the reporting for each
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
election cycle will be in that case
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
reporting versus registering I've heard
 
00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:16.380 align:start position:0%
from yours
 
00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:18.660 align:start position:0%
discussions that you possibly think a
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
candidate should have to register you
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
think that everyone should use the
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
online campaign Finance system and the
 
00:58:30.170 --> 00:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
the way we do it in currently is that
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
you can register on a paper form or you
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
can register in the campaign Finance
 
00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
system if you're going to use the
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance system as a candidate
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
you have to register so if you're
 
00:58:43.010 --> 00:58:43.020 align:start position:0%
pushing everyone towards using the
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance system everyone has to
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
register anyway so
 
00:58:46.799 --> 00:58:47.630 align:start position:0%
register anyway so
um

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:51.349 align:start position:0%
and the
um

00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
oh also there's a definition for special
 
00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
election because that was there was
 
00:58:57.530 --> 00:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
never a definition anymore so in as you
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
read through you'll see that I've put in
 
00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
here that if you have a surplus or a
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
deficit after if you basically if you
 
00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
don't have a zero balance after the
 
00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
election cycle and you've made your
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
final report according to the new
 
00:59:10.319 --> 00:59:11.750 align:start position:0%
final report according to the new
schedule

00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
um then you're you're done you don't
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
have to re-register you don't have to do
 
00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:19.140 align:start position:0%
any more reports but if you have funds
 
00:59:21.549 --> 00:59:21.559 align:start position:0%
or deficit you're automatically
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
registered for the next election cycle
 
00:59:26.809 --> 00:59:26.819 align:start position:0%
so you don't have to remember that oh I
 
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
actually have to register again and then
 
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
you have to report that balance whatever
 
00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:36.020 align:start position:0%
it was on the top of your next
 
00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
ideally in the system it'll be reported
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
as your opening balance and then and
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's important because I if I remember
 
00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:46.010 align:start position:0%
that's important because I if I remember
correctly

00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in here
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
it the registration expires some number
 
00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:54.059 align:start position:0%
of you know a few days after the general
 
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
election right right which is
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
um something extremely confusing we I
 
01:00:00.289 --> 01:00:00.299 align:start position:0%
find for people who I agree with that
 
01:00:00.299 --> 01:00:02.650 align:start position:0%
find for people who I agree with that
yeah

01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:02.660 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
some of us find that yeah you can't you
 
01:00:08.569 --> 01:00:08.579 align:start position:0%
can't continue to operate on your
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
current campaign but
 
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
um let's see
 
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
okay so it automatically
 
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
re-registered someone yes if the deficit
 
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
or Surplus yeah for the next election
 
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
cycle The Only Exception would be for a
 
01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
special election because a special
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
election is just for that special
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
election and you're not you're not a
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
candidate that's running for a seat over
 
01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:36.180 align:start position:0%
and over again so if you if you've
 
01:00:38.329 --> 01:00:38.339 align:start position:0%
set up if you've registered for a
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
special election and you wanted to use
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
it again
 
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
you would have to assume that there'd be
 
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
another special election that you're
 
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
running for but
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
um so I've tried to Define that out so
 
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
if you have a special election
 
01:00:52.809 --> 01:00:52.819 align:start position:0%
campaign and expenditures and you have a
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
balance at the end of it you would have
 
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
to do what you do now with the balance
 
01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
and that would be to donate it to your
 
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
next campaign so whatever that if you're
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
going to run for whatever your office
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
you'd be running for in the next cycle
 
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
01:01:14.329 --> 01:01:14.339 align:start position:0%
I think so okay it's what you have to do
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
now but we just have to make it clearer
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
in legislation I'll have to actually
 
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:20.220 align:start position:0%
take the time to read it
 
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
to be sure but
 
01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:25.140 align:start position:0%
um on pages seven
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
through nine
 
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.250 align:start position:0%
through nine
I've

01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
I've
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
um crossed out a lot of the
 
01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
the language
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
to meet with what hb2 said but then also
 
01:01:38.809 --> 01:01:38.819 align:start position:0%
crossed out the
 
01:01:38.819 --> 01:01:41.030 align:start position:0%
crossed out the
um

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
the the phases of the campaign cycle
 
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
because I haven't included them in the
 
01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
language so there's no limits for pre
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
pre-camp pre-filing there's no limits
 
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
um general election or the primary it's
 
01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
just this is the limit for the election
 
01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:59.089 align:start position:0%
just this is the limit for the election
cycle

01:01:59.089 --> 01:01:59.099 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
and that's I haven't changed those
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
limits that's what hp2 had
 
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
or current law
 
01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:07.609 align:start position:0%
or current law
um

01:02:07.609 --> 01:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the big changes that I've
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
made are in 664 6 reporting by political
 
01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.950 align:start position:0%
made are in 664 6 reporting by political
committees

01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
um and that includes the I've deleted
 
01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
several sections and I and I've
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
Consolidated them into more of a bullet
 
01:02:22.559 --> 01:02:23.589 align:start position:0%
Consolidated them into more of a bullet
format

01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
format
 
01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:26.339 align:start position:0%
you'll see some highlights there there
 
01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
was a lot of talk about alphabetical
 
01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
order if it's done
 
01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:31.799 align:start position:0%
ultimately if it's done in the system
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
it'll be in alphabetical order I
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
highlighted occupation and job title
 
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.270 align:start position:0%
highlighted occupation and job title
because

01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
in the definition section they are the
 
01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
same thing so however you decide to go
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
forward with with that definition
 
01:02:45.599 --> 01:02:46.849 align:start position:0%
forward with with that definition
um

01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
I've tried to put all of the when you
 
01:02:51.410 --> 01:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
have to register to a certain dollar
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
amount and I think I've included as a
 
01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars since that what you've
 
01:02:58.730 --> 01:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
most recently changed the advocacy
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
organizations to a thousand dollars
 
01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
um I've added more information to
 
01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:10.250 align:start position:0%
um I've added more information to
um

01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:15.289 --> 01:03:15.299 align:start position:0%
um the section 5 of 664.
 
01:03:17.569 --> 01:03:17.579 align:start position:0%
6 about
 
01:03:17.579 --> 01:03:19.130 align:start position:0%
6 about
um

01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:19.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
how it will be Autumn conditionally
 
01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:23.339 align:start position:0%
renewed if you're not a candidate
 
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
committee if you've paid your fifty
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
dollars so this is
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
the automatic re-registration piece but
 
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
in in law there's certain political
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
committees that have to pay fifty
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
dollars to register so
 
01:03:36.119 --> 01:03:40.309 align:start position:0%
dollars to register so
um

01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
there's a little
 
01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:43.370 align:start position:0%
there's a little
um

01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
the logic in when if you run for speaker
 
01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:51.900 align:start position:0%
of the house when you have to report
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
um you can't
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
become speaker until your final report
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
is reported but that deadline for the
 
01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
final final report is after you're done
 
01:04:05.089 --> 01:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
with your your race and because you take
 
01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
the speakership as soon as you're voted
 
01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
in it's there's a there's some spirals
 
01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
in there that don't make sense the logic
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
so that needs to be fixed somehow
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
however you decide you want to require
 
01:04:21.049 --> 01:04:21.059 align:start position:0%
that to be done which section is that
 
01:04:28.849 --> 01:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
page 15 yes and I've just highlighted in
 
01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
blue okay the question there thank you
 
01:04:37.849 --> 01:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
I've deleted section 664 9A
 
01:04:37.859 --> 01:04:39.230 align:start position:0%
I've deleted section 664 9A
for

01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:40.130 align:start position:0%
for
um

01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:40.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:44.510 align:start position:0%
um
readability

01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.549 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
and and uh excuse me you're you're doing
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
that because
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
the use of the fax machine is pretty
 
01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.170 align:start position:0%
the use of the fax machine is pretty
much

01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
a thing of the past well we get a lot of
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
calls to the office that they can't read
 
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
somebody's statement
 
01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
and when you fax something you have to
 
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
print it out on your home printer
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
and then fax it and then we get the
 
01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:13.619 align:start position:0%
facts and then we have to scan it and
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
upload it in online to the campaign
 
01:05:18.049 --> 01:05:18.059 align:start position:0%
Finance so there's a lot of places where
 
01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
it gets degraded over time the
 
01:05:23.089 --> 01:05:23.099 align:start position:0%
information so I've just deleted that
 
01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
because we get too many complaints about
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
it you can put it back in if you like
 
01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
but also I know that this committee has
 
01:05:33.049 --> 01:05:33.059 align:start position:0%
talked a lot about about mandating of
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
when somebody has to use the campaign
 
01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:36.500 align:start position:0%
Finance system
 
01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
and because I didn't hear a final I've
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
just put in an option which is that um
 
01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:46.619 align:start position:0%
you can um and it's on the top of page
 
01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
16 that statements of receipts and
 
01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:49.849 align:start position:0%
16 that statements of receipts and
expenditures

01:05:49.849 --> 01:05:49.859 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
as required under this section may also
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
be filed by means of electronic mail put
 
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
our email address in there through the
 
01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
end of the 2024 election cycle
 
01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
statements filed via the campaign
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
Finance system shall be publicly
 
01:06:05.809 --> 01:06:05.819 align:start position:0%
available on the Secretary of State's
 
01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
website statements filed the electronic
 
01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
mail sell Republic of the available on
 
01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
the same website within seven days after
 
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
the statement is filed we have a lot of
 
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
people who file the statement at the
 
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
like five o'clock on the due date and
 
01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:23.089 align:start position:0%
like five o'clock on the due date and
um

01:06:23.089 --> 01:06:23.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:26.089 --> 01:06:26.099 align:start position:0%
in our office we have limited people who
 
01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
are able to get the information up and
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
upload it especially if somebody hasn't
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
actually registered in the system yet so
 
01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
we need some time to upload the
 
01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
information if they've done it
 
01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
electronic uh via email or fax currently
 
01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.349 align:start position:0%
electronic uh via email or fax currently
so

01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
play with that however you feel fit as
 
01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
as always but I just put them in there
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
as one of the options
 
01:06:51.289 --> 01:06:51.299 align:start position:0%
um I haven't had a chance to talk with
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
anyone a legal expert on what 60 6410 is
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish
 
01:07:01.849 --> 01:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
um so I just put a question in there of
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
what it means it sounds to me that if
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
you do one of these activities you don't
 
01:07:08.329 --> 01:07:08.339 align:start position:0%
have to report it
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
but if you're using campaign funds I
 
01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
would assume that you always have to
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
report all your expenditures otherwise
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
how can you get to a zero balance
 
01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.549 align:start position:0%
how can you get to a zero balance
but

01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:07:21.410 --> 01:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
I just I just have that question in
 
01:07:22.609 --> 01:07:22.619 align:start position:0%
there for
 
01:07:22.619 --> 01:07:23.270 align:start position:0%
there for
um

01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
someone with more legal background for
 
01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
me than me too answer
 
01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:29.750 align:start position:0%
me than me too answer
um

01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of changing a Fiscal Agent to
 
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
Treasurer in the next sections
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
foreign I did a little bit of that and I
 
01:07:41.329 --> 01:07:41.339 align:start position:0%
was doing something similar
 
01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
and I picked a Fiscal Agent but I
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
Treasurer Fiscal Agent as long as we use
 
01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
the same phrase I only found one or two
 
01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
places where the term Financial agent
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
was used at all and one thing that I did
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
not include are two things I didn't
 
01:07:58.730 --> 01:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
include in here I have a few more things
 
01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
to discuss but is that
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
um we at the Secretary of State's office
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
are happy to assist people set up a
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
terminal or an iPad or something if
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
somebody needs assistance with filing
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance reports online or
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
registering online we're also happy to
 
01:08:18.769 --> 01:08:18.779 align:start position:0%
reach out to the libraries across the
 
01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:20.339 align:start position:0%
state to give them information if
 
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in there to use one of
 
01:08:24.169 --> 01:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
their computers and their internet on
 
01:08:27.010 --> 01:08:27.020 align:start position:0%
how to use the campaign Finance system
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
the other thing is is that if I know
 
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
that when I ran for the house I had on
 
01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
my science Fiscal Agent and then my
 
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal agent's name so there may we may
 
01:08:42.289 --> 01:08:42.299 align:start position:0%
need to put a new section in here that
 
01:08:42.299 --> 01:08:44.809 align:start position:0%
need to put a new section in here that
um

01:08:44.809 --> 01:08:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
treasure shall also mean Fiscal Agent or
 
01:08:51.289 --> 01:08:51.299 align:start position:0%
for for those for those house members
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
who have signs and don't want to have to
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
reprint signs or something like that who
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
you know if you already have the
 
01:09:00.809 --> 01:09:00.819 align:start position:0%
materials that say Fiscal Agent on it
 
01:09:00.819 --> 01:09:04.189 align:start position:0%
materials that say Fiscal Agent on it
[Laughter]

01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
um that would just be a recommendation
 
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
um page 18 uh we have we get a lot of
 
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
calls about what you need to say
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
um your disclosure on who paid for
 
01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.550 align:start position:0%
um your disclosure on who paid for
something

01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
um and it's the language in current law
 
01:09:21.169 --> 01:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
is a bit confusing
 
01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
um a lot some people know that they can
 
01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
put a website but if you go to that
 
01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
website sometimes there's no information
 
01:09:30.530 --> 01:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
on there in there of who paid for it who
 
01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:33.179 align:start position:0%
the fist or Treasurer is so I've tried
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
to make it much more clear that the
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
signature shell State paid for by and
 
01:09:39.289 --> 01:09:39.299 align:start position:0%
you have put the name of the candidate
 
01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
or candidate committee the address of
 
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
the candidate or Canada committee the
 
01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
name of the treasurer and that um in
 
01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
lieu of that information you could also
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
have an internet address and when you
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
type in that address the website has to
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
have all of that information
 
01:09:59.229 --> 01:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
right there available
 
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me what section is that again oh
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:11.830 align:start position:0%
 
mm-hmm

01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.250 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
um

01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
I there's a one thought I had on 66414
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
pre-reported political messages
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
it it says message uh messages audio
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
messages is delivered by a telephone
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
um I I put into a telephone because
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes telephones are not used to
 
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
deliver the messages
 
01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:41.890 align:start position:0%
deliver the messages
um

01:10:41.890 --> 01:10:41.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
the section there's a lot of sections
 
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
towards the end of 664 that I would want
 
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
to get more input from the AGS office on
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
I know that they spoke to
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
spoke to some of that but I would want
 
01:10:57.229 --> 01:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
to get their their input on that
 
01:10:58.970 --> 01:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
um and that's
 
01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
a general overview of the changes and
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.570 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions
um

01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
and then send this to you when I do have
 
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
more feedback from my office and the
 
01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
thank you I do have one question uh no
 
01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:18.470 align:start position:0%
thank you I do have one question uh no
pressure

01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
pressure
 
01:11:20.689 --> 01:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
do you just do you have a feel for when
 
01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
you think you might have
 
01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
a more final draft of this just looking
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
for an idea when would you like a more
 
01:11:28.729 --> 01:11:28.739 align:start position:0%
final draft yeah that's that's the
 
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
question that's the way I used to answer
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
questions like that when I had a
 
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.669 align:start position:0%
questions like that when I had a
supervisor

01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
supervisor
 
01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
I'm really I'm really looking for a
 
01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
rough idea and okay I personally will
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
not hold you to it yeah
 
01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:44.570 align:start position:0%
not hold you to it yeah
um

01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
so you said your meeting in August
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
so I would say by the end of July would
 
01:11:51.649 --> 01:11:51.659 align:start position:0%
be very would be you
 
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
time frame that would be
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's a lot of information it was
 
01:11:59.870 --> 01:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
not an easy task to go through this I am
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
not going to come back at you saying
 
01:12:02.689 --> 01:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
it's late
 
01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
it's when you have the opportunity to do
 
01:12:06.410 --> 01:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
it I was just looking for a rough idea
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
so I could do at least a minimal
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
planning as to when to apply my efforts
 
01:12:12.649 --> 01:12:12.659 align:start position:0%
yeah because I think this is this is
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
going to be very useful to all of us
 
01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
would you guys agree
 
01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
that's fantastic I mean esteemed fellow
 
01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:20.209 align:start position:0%
that's fantastic I mean esteemed fellow
Representatives

01:12:20.209 --> 01:12:20.219 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
01:12:22.850 --> 01:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
good I'm glad um okay just as somebody
 
01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.229 align:start position:0%
good I'm glad um okay just as somebody
who

01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
had to start using this more on a more
 
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
daily basis I can understand a lot of
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
frustrations where
 
01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
and the why the why we get phone calls
 
01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
to the office
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that extremely
 
01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
rough estimate as to the next graph
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
which we will have forgotten by the time
 
01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
anyway okay thank you very much and I
 
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
also just want to remind you about
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
August 2nd
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
um when we will have the new ballot
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
counting electronic ballot counting
 
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
devices for you to cast ballots through
 
01:13:00.169 --> 01:13:00.179 align:start position:0%
and give your feedback to the ballot law
 
01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
commission and that will be in this
 
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
building I don't know the exact time yet
 
01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
but more information to come soon
 
01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
okay oh
 
01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lane but if she
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
looked like she's getting ready to leave
 
01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.149 align:start position:0%
looked like she's getting ready to leave
some

01:13:17.149 --> 01:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
types of political committees
 
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
um I haven't had a chance to look at
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
them all are these all kind of defined
 
01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
in here like a candidate Committee
 
01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.169 align:start position:0%
in here like a candidate Committee
created

01:13:33.169 --> 01:13:33.179 align:start position:0%
created
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
so is candidate committee defined
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.850 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
um

01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
I just haven't had a chance to look at
 
01:13:39.719 --> 01:13:42.530 align:start position:0%
I just haven't had a chance to look at
it

01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:47.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
I'll have to get I will have to figure
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
that out okay I can't remember right now
 
01:13:53.689 --> 01:13:53.699 align:start position:0%
yeah again I just kind of noticed that
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh political advocacy organization
 
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
um we had talked about not about maybe
 
01:14:02.689 --> 01:14:02.699 align:start position:0%
that wasn't necessary did you include
 
01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
that because when you did more research
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
you thought it was necessary I just want
 
01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
to kind of get a sense so that is
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
defined in here right um so I I kept it
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
in there because it was it is something
 
01:14:18.050 --> 01:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
different than some of the other ones
 
01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:19.310 align:start position:0%
different than some of the other ones
um

01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
okay I think right now in law
 
01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
um our general counsel's read of it
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
would be that there's nine different
 
01:14:29.209 --> 01:14:29.219 align:start position:0%
options right
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know that there needs to be nine
 
01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:33.780 align:start position:0%
different options because one option is
 
01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:34.669 align:start position:0%
different options because one option is
also

01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
one option is a subset of another option
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
exactly it's yeah I tried to condense
 
01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
them down okay
 
01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
I will
 
01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
in the next version I will make sure
 
01:14:47.090 --> 01:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
that all of these are defined somehow
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
okay yeah and I'm probably going to be
 
01:14:51.649 --> 01:14:51.659 align:start position:0%
tinkering with it too but I you know
 
01:14:51.659 --> 01:14:53.390 align:start position:0%
tinkering with it too but I you know
well

01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.110 align:start position:0%
well
um

01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.149 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:56.159 --> 01:14:58.490 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.729 --> 01:15:01.739 align:start position:0%
we we haven't really talked about
 
01:15:04.850 --> 01:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
um independent expenditures I mean we
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
kind of touched on it a couple times and
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
that that's what the super Pacs were
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
doing and they kind of
 
01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
I I was going to try and figure out if
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
we needed a better definition of
 
01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
independent expenditure and I I saw that
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
you didn't do that but we haven't really
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
talked about it that much on the
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
committee so I just wondered if that was
 
01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons I I didn't try unless
 
01:15:32.209 --> 01:15:32.219 align:start position:0%
there was some inconsistencies another
 
01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:34.140 align:start position:0%
place I didn't try and fix anything that
 
01:15:36.890 --> 01:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
would be more of a policy decision
 
01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
and election cycle I was just curious on
 
01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
the dates picked and I'm still trying to
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
wrap my mind around yep you know all
 
01:15:51.649 --> 01:15:51.659 align:start position:0%
that so so and again this is just my
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
take on what everyone was saying is that
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
at some point at some point there needs
 
01:15:58.970 --> 01:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
to be a cut off between one one election
 
01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
cycle ends and when the next begins when
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
somebody should be registering
 
01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
um if you can
 
01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
um if you can carry Surplus over or a
 
01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
deficit over or how long and it's if
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
there's so many different options for
 
01:16:17.689 --> 01:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
somebody just to keep going and and
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
they're not quite sure which of the
 
01:16:21.229 --> 01:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
filings they should be doing the six
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
month filings or the new committee
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
filings if they
 
01:16:26.689 --> 01:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
um I just tried to make it as simple as
 
01:16:29.209 --> 01:16:29.219 align:start position:0%
possible and that
 
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
the election cycle is a two-year cycle
 
01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
it starts on the eighth day after the
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
last general election and ends on the
 
01:16:39.050 --> 01:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
seventh day following the current
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
general election
 
01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
so to get to representative
 
01:16:45.530 --> 01:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
his concern he
 
01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
want a candidate
 
01:16:51.169 --> 01:16:51.179 align:start position:0%
candid fundraising right after you kind
 
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
of get around that so it by cutting that
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
which is why I think he was favoring
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
like the election day like if you start
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
doing anything so this would be
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
this would allow within those eight days
 
01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
than for somebody to go in and try and
 
01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
campaign get money for their next
 
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
election I know I mean I certainly won't
 
01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
be doing it but I know that there are
 
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
you know people that do it so and have
 
01:17:23.689 --> 01:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
that capacity to do it so that that
 
01:17:25.729 --> 01:17:25.739 align:start position:0%
would allow them still to do that just
 
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
he's not here so I'm raising this I
 
01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
think when when I seven days is a very
 
01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
short window of time to do any
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
campaigning after an election and what I
 
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
I picked seven days because
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
um currently there's there's a
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
there's reporting that you have to do
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
two Wednesdays after the so I I kind of
 
01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
tried to do it within the same window of
 
01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
time that you currently have to report
 
01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
and also if if you are campaigning and
 
01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
you're super busy up into the election
 
01:17:59.630 --> 01:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's some
 
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
some expenses and some funds you've
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
received running up to the election that
 
01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
haven't been recorded yet correct and so
 
01:18:09.169 --> 01:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
it just gives a week for somebody to
 
01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
clean up their books and report
 
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
everything okay
 
01:18:14.689 --> 01:18:14.699 align:start position:0%
that's that was my I was just trying the
 
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
purpose of putting that in there so when
 
01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
he asked the question I know the answer
 
01:18:21.890 --> 01:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
and it's just a suggestion oh sorry did
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
you turn me off
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
oh is that what I did oh
 
01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:32.450 align:start position:0%
oh is that what I did oh
[Laughter]

01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
yes I pressed the button on the left by
 
01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:42.590 align:start position:0%
yes I pressed the button on the left by
mistake

01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.709 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:18:51.649 --> 01:18:51.659 align:start position:0%
uh so you so you picked through this
 
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
seventh day essentially after the
 
01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
general election because it corresponds
 
01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
to the day you have to file the report
 
01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
roughly to when you currently have to
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
file so it's it's just a date day and
 
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
time and all of the
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
the filings are listed
 
01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
and now bullet point but
 
01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
um just based on your committee's
 
01:19:16.130 --> 01:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
discussion about it's difficult to
 
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
figure out when one cycle ends and one
 
01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
one begins deficits and surpluses I just
 
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
picked a a date and time that seemed
 
01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable I understand and that was a
 
01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
very reasonable thing to do for this
 
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:36.169 --> 01:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
and I'm doing this again from memory the
 
01:19:36.179 --> 01:19:38.110 align:start position:0%
and I'm doing this again from memory the
AG

01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
AG
 
01:19:40.729 --> 01:19:40.739 align:start position:0%
suggested they wanted the ability to do
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
some fines and do anything was that that
 
01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
I don't see anything in here did I okay
 
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
I didn't I didn't I just going off of
 
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
their sheet I have I didn't I didn't
 
01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
want to make the proposed edits without
 
01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
their input because they they did have
 
01:19:58.970 --> 01:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
some enforcement requests but I didn't
 
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
know what what those specifically should
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
look like so I figured since they're
 
01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
lawyers they'd be better at writing the
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
law than I would be okay I just wanted
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
any other comments or questions for the
 
01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
I did want to respond to your question
 
01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
about corporations versus business
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
organizations and this is my
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
understanding you would you would want
 
01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
to reach out to the AG's office but I
 
01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:34.340 align:start position:0%
believe that any business organization
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
would be Corporation and that's that's
 
01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
how the limits would be currently
 
01:20:43.729 --> 01:20:43.739 align:start position:0%
um maybe a suggestion would be to
 
01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
replace Corporation in that section with
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
business organizations since it's
 
01:20:50.209 --> 01:20:50.219 align:start position:0%
already defined that's what I was
 
01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
wanting but that would be
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
I'll follow up with Matthew okay and ask
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
okay oh thank you very much for your
 
01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
anything else on my fellow committee
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.330 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:21:26.330 --> 01:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
we're not required to stay here till
 
01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:31.189 align:start position:0%
we're not required to stay here till
noon

01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:33.719 align:start position:0%
I mean I've said what I was interested
 
01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
maybe we've got a good plan we're ready
 
01:21:42.050 --> 01:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
to go you know I do have one question
 
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
for my
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
bill of Representatives if if either of
 
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
you seen an example of a report that
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
comes out of a subcommittee like this
 
01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
maybe I could direct that question to
 
01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:04.370 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.649 --> 01:22:06.659 align:start position:0%
but where's your office
 
01:22:11.930 --> 01:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know I just email her okay
 
01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:13.739 align:start position:0%
and she's usually listening to us
 
01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
because you remember that time we talked
 
01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
I do remember that was a very that was a
 
01:22:20.169 --> 01:22:20.179 align:start position:0%
very helpful could you please come down

I'll ask okay
 
01:22:29.689 --> 01:22:29.699 align:start position:0%
all right so uh if there we have nothing
 
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
