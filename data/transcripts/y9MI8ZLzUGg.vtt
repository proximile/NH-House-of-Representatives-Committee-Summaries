receiving it officially now okay but i'm
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
sure your printer printed out
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
essentially it takes the word cosmetics
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
out and it
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
provides the state of new hampshire with
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
the ability to ban all
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
products tested on animals
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%

see this and you have uh done your best
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
to find out where i might have dropped
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
the ball i provided everyone with our
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
synopsis of of the amendment okay on
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
i'll just read it
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
dear representatives
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh the proposed amendments to sb202
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
appears to have severe unintended
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
consequences for many essential products
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and we would love to see
 
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.029 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and we would love to see
uh

00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
animal testing
 
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.830 align:start position:0%
animal testing
stopped

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
stopped
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
as much as possible uh i would just say
 
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.510 align:start position:0%
as much as possible uh i would just say
that

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
to state that as a
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
before we begin uh unfortunately there
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
are many types of products that require
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
animal testing that are not adequately
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
addressed in this language such as
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical products if any of you
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
took a
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical product this morning such
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
as i did myself or blood pressure
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
that would not be allowed because that's
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
tested on animals probably and that
 
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be allowed to be sold in new
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire under this amendment
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
over-the-counter drugs vaccines food
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
additives industrial chemicals just to
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
name some
 
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
and i've just spelled out some of the
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
four areas where they would be
 
00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.070 align:start position:0%
four areas where they would be
prohibited

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
which probably are essential to most of
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
our lives today
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
there's a link in the actual email which
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
i did provide to
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
but to the chairman
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
early on he had this
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
ranking member
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
bartlett also had this early on in
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
discussions of this amendment when it
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
was first brought up last week
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
um so the chairman you have had access
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
to this for at least a week yep um so
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
if you if you are able to look into
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
these links there are food and drug
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
administration regulations all kinds of
 
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.950 align:start position:0%
administration regulations all kinds of
federal

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
laws and regulations that would
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
supersede anything that this uh
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
this legislature could could do on its
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
own um this this bill as it stands and
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
was passed unanimously by the senate
 
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.190 align:start position:0%
was passed unanimously by the senate
um

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
has uh well thought out carved out
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
exemptions it has passed eight states it
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
is a fed it is a mirrors a federal law
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately stuck in congress as many
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
bills good bills are
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
which is why the industry
 
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.590 align:start position:0%
which is why the industry
the

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
personal care products association has
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
endorsed this legislation
 
00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.630 align:start position:0%
endorsed this legislation
um

00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
along with
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
uh the federal legislation
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
you're repeating what you've said in
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
testimony okay i'm sorry yeah that's
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
fine okay so the question i have for you
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
is um there are two sections but i'll
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
start with the one that seems most
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
obvious to me
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh under 359 t2
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.350 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
you wanna see this where is
 
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.590 align:start position:0%
you wanna see this where is
i

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical or medical product
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
so that is not does not take care of
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals medical devices vaccines
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm i mean i am not familiar
 
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
enough with the federal law to know or
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
the exact
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know the fact that this may or
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
may not pass muster in the courts et
 
00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.230 align:start position:0%
may not pass muster in the courts et
cetera

00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
cetera
 
00:23:59.669 --> 00:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
i would say that it certainly isn't
 
00:23:59.679 --> 00:24:00.950 align:start position:0%
i would say that it certainly isn't
sufficient

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
um and and that's my opinion uh
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
and i would say it doesn't cover a
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
what what part of pharmaceutical or
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
medical product does not include
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
pharmacies and other
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps over the counter drugs medical
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
device what where what part do those two
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps perhaps it works for you it
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't work for me got it okay so i
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
won't even bother pointing out the other
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
one in roman numeral two
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
okay so this is just uh we can agree to
 
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.470 align:start position:0%
okay so this is just uh we can agree to
disagree

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
and but that i did ask you on you know
 
00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
when i sent you a copy of this to tell
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
me if there was anything specifically in
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
statute that you thought i needed to add
 
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
to ensure this and and the best you can
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
say is
 
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
that you think there's unintended
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
consequences but if you asked me where
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
in the federal law were there conflicts
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
yeah where i provided that to you but
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
you know i'm i think i respond to you
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
perfect as quickly as possible any time
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not uh it's fine that's great and i
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
i you know i appreciate my i know that
 
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
this is not uh customary for you to call
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
on me and i appreciate the time today
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
good thanks all right
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
any questions uh for him yep
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
representative van halen
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
ehrenberg am i correct correctly
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
pronouncing your name erin berg thank
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
you um
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
as i recall when i was reviewing this
 
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment pretty well parallels the
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
original bill is that
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
pretty much the case i mean it looks as
 
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
though it takes out i mean i didn't
 
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
write it but it takes out
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
the word cosmetic space right but it
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
does pretty well parallel are you
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
familiar with any states that are
 
00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.549 align:start position:0%
familiar with any states that are
currently

00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
following what the amendment indicates
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
about products tested on animals
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
globally or would we be the first
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
what is in the original bill no i
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
understand the original bill the
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
is the same as other
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
but the amendment are you aware of any
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
states that are following so that not
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
this would be the first i am not aware
 
00:26:05.919 --> 00:26:06.789 align:start position:0%
this would be the first i am not aware
of

00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
whether it is being used or whether it
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
would be the first i i can't tell you
 
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
either one
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
um so may i just ask you about your
 
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
opinion of the breadth of this is this
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
too broad in your opinion to be viable
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire the so cosmetics is an
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
area that we are able to actually
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
get this done and
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
test products without animals suffering
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
this bill does that this bill is a great
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
step forward for the animals
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
that are now suffering daily
 
00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
tests being tested
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
we've been very careful to make sure
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
that there are the right exemptions that
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
all of the areas that people
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely need the products that stood
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
on animals
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
will be able to use those products and
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
that there are no
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
retailer in the state
 
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
would be held responsible if the
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturer of the products are
 
00:27:06.159 --> 00:27:07.510 align:start position:0%
manufacturer of the products are
responsible

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
and that no data that is collected
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
anywhere could be used
 
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.750 align:start position:0%
anywhere could be used
uh

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
to to provide for a product
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
being included
 
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.750 align:start position:0%
being included
in

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
as a as data that was tested on animals
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
could not be included i hope that was
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
clear probably wasn't um
 
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%

have
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%

decided to
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
i decided to beef it up
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
um no it's not a problem i was trying to
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%

00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
why did i think there was six hands up
 
00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:49.590 align:start position:0%
why did i think there was six hands up
who

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
so you really don't want to take care of
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
all right i'm i'm sorry i i my personal
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
opinion is i don't know how anybody
 
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
could be opposed to this amendment if
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
you really really care
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
about animals
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
why would you
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
why would you pick one industry oh
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
because cosmetics are an unnecessary
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
why why would it who's going to
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
why would anybody vote against this
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
i'm not killing the bill i don't think
 
00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:36.149 align:start position:0%
i'm not killing the bill i don't think
we're

00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:30:36.159 --> 00:30:37.909 align:start position:0%
we're
okay

00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's your opinion that skill
 
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill so i guess so you're saying the
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
senate that is going to kill this bill
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
you could say the governor is going to
 
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
who says it's not workable the only
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.279 --> 00:30:56.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
we don't have to discuss this anymore
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
we'll take it up when the executive
 
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.070 align:start position:0%
we'll take it up when the executive
session

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.669 align:start position:0%
session
okay

00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
okay uh 355 we did already take action
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
on this and had uh interim study so um
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
at this point i think we'll just leave
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me mr chair yes is there some
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
reason why we had it on today's agenda
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
um i did put it on the agenda because i
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
was forcing this bill to be taken up
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
today rather than last week
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
and um i i just out of habit thought if
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
any bill that we're taking up i just was
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
in case there was something comes up we
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
could we would have it okay so we have
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
venture and study five four out of
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is that correct correct
 
00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:51.590 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is that correct correct
okay

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
senate bill 340. um senate bill 340 is
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
still not ready
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
um as you remember there was some
 
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
conversation uh i think the kim
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee already moved um
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
it had moved uh
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
in expedient as i believe is it
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
and um so that will be the pending
 
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:13.519 align:start position:0%
motion going forward
 
00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:15.519 align:start position:0%
and hopefully my my
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
my new amendment will be ready by the
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
time we take it up otherwise i might be
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
tempted to bring my amendment onto the
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
house floor
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
but at this point um that there
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
no need to subcommittee at it
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
i guess i could pre uh just tell
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
everybody where i'm at and what i've
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
been doing um so everybody understands
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh where where what you had when i sent
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
it to you last night
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
um and that is uh this this bill
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
i guess i would first by begin to tell
 
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.230 align:start position:0%
i guess i would first by begin to tell
everybody

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
forget about who
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
requested the bill
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
all right you could say
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
senator daniels brought this bill in for
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
a constituent
 
00:32:55.679 --> 00:32:56.549 align:start position:0%
a constituent
but

00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
i would have to say this every time we
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
have changed our liquor laws and it goes
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
i can think back when
 
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:03.990 align:start position:0%
i can think back when
um

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:04.870 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
but we had
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
from lee the for the first person who
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to had distilled vodka john stark
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
vodka and he just wanted to be able to
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
sell it flag hill he just wanted to sell
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
it in his facility
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
because that was illegal that the only
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
place you could get distilled alcohol
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
was at the new hampshire liquor store so
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
theoretically he was sending people
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
to the liquor store he was the only
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
person who requested that bill
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
there was nobody else who came in for
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
that bill as far as i know he might have
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
been the only distiller in the state
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
so yes representative
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'll say we did get
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
this some email from um
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
aiden moore regarding the number of
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
licenses that have the direct to
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
consumer permit
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
and the numbers um
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
show that only one brewing company has
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
been taking advantage of this permit
 
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:02.789 align:start position:0%
been taking advantage of this permit
now

00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
would you confirm with me that right now
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
there's supposed to be a
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
a limit of 27 gallons
 
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.550 align:start position:0%
a limit of 27 gallons
per

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
per
 
00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.629 align:start position:0%
per
individual

00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
per individual
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
delivery for individual delivery that
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
and that is what he pointed out was um
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
the downside of having that
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
per individual per year i've been put
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
yeah the 20 was 27
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
was it 27 ounces gallons gallons right
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
so that was a per year delivery
 
00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:39.430 align:start position:0%
so that was a per year delivery
so

00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
and was was lifted when i did the direct
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
shipping law and when i did the direct
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
shipping law i was assuming
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
a case of beer a month
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
so that's where that cut that number
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
came from okay now the numbers that um
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
mr moore prevent provided to us show
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
that there were 3 509
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
16 ounce deliveries right we don't know
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
how many individuals because the person
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
that's delivering them has not been
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
keeping records is that correct no
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's not what happened the the liquor
 
00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.079 align:start position:0%
commission didn't say to
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
that when they had that report issued
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
they never said oh by the way
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
did uh how many you know give us a
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
breakdown of all the people
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
and tell me how much you delivered to
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
each one of those people
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
you probably think that that maybe is a
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
little more tuned in from too much
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
information to be put on a piece of
 
00:35:33.839 --> 00:35:35.030 align:start position:0%
information to be put on a piece of
paper

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
paper
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
that would you want a the beverage
 
00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.950 align:start position:0%
that would you want a the beverage
manufacturer

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
stating in writing on a piece of paper
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
distributed to all house reps or all
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
house committee anyway it came to me and
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
i distributed to you but that list
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
everybody's listing their names and how
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
much beer they bought this year
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
no we weren't going to do that i don't
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
think that's what i was asking i think i
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
was asking um about the 27 gallons they
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
were complying
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
with the law as it stood now uh
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that that that they
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
there was compliance yes
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
how did we know that they were
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
complaining okay
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
okay again because now we have a bill
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
asking to increase it to 50 gallons and
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is that
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment coming that would
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
not have any limit to it correct
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
so the 27's out the window okay the 50
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
gallons and the bill would be out the
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
window and any limit would be it so they
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
can deliver as much beer as they want to
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
any individual
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
right so now i'll get into my second
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
part of my story
 
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
okay my second part of my story is
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
that if you were to come into a rest a a
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
go to a
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
nano brewer in this case or a brewer and
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
you would go there
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
every day
 
00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
and buy a four
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
pack you would probably exceed that 27
 
00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.950 align:start position:0%
pack you would probably exceed that 27
gallons

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
the point i was trying to make with this
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
new amendment is
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
that no
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer winery distillery
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
anyone who produces alcohol except
 
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.790 align:start position:0%
anyone who produces alcohol except
rectifiers

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
rectifiers
 
00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
anyone who produces alcohol should be
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
allowed to do the exact same thing to
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
give the person whatever they order
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to buy
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
as long as they have that face-to-face
 
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:32.230 align:start position:0%
as long as they have that face-to-face
contact

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
they know the person
 
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
hasn't over consumed
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
they've got a check on the driver's
 
00:37:37.119 --> 00:37:38.630 align:start position:0%
they've got a check on the driver's
license

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
they cannot deliver
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
okay so what i was trying to do is take
 
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
what we had already done with the
 
00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.510 align:start position:0%
what we had already done with the
restaurants

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
so if you're going to have any problems
 
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
with this you have to go look at the
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
restaurant statute and see that we had
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
already passed all that
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
and say is that
 
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
it i have to admit never crossed my mind
 
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
alcohol producer would think it's a good
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
idea to deliver to end users
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
it seemed very expensive
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
cost prohibitive
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
and a pain in the neck
 
00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.349 align:start position:0%
and a pain in the neck
but

00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
if the fact that we have one
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
and we know that we have
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
other deliveries that are going on
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh we have the the
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
restaurant statute
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
that are delivering alcohol
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
why not just say
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
once and for all pass one bill i mean
 
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
that's true we could just kill this
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
thing and i'll bri i'll introduce this
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
build next year
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
but if we already are so close to
 
00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
knowing exactly where we want to be
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't it be worth it to try to do
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
it but if you want to vote against this
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
now that's fine and i won't hold it
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
against you when you vote for it again
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
next year when you see the logic of the
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
idea that we should have a level playing
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
field among all alcohol producers
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
that simply says if you want to deliver
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
you've got to use the same requirements
 
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
that the restaurants have so this is now
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
going to open up the floodgates so i i
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
would guarantee you that won't open
 
00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.870 align:start position:0%
would guarantee you that won't open
floodgates

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
floodgates
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
beer wine distilled spirits anything
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
with no limits
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
should be able to be delivered to
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
somebody's home or place of business is
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
that correct correct
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.839 --> 00:39:34.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's the old model and you know let me
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
put it this way to say is that we would
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
only pass that if we got rid of liquor
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
stores no we we're just saying is why
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
not if we're if we're allowing other
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
people to deliver
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't we allow the manufacturer
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
to deliver what what's wrong now i i
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
guess if i was connie
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
i would say well this is trampling the
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
three-tier model
 
00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.430 align:start position:0%
three-tier model
right

00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
so she's against brew pubs
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
and yeah because they're they're the
 
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
number one trampler of the three-tier
 
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
system they were they were the first
 
00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
trampler see that was a stampede that
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
okay so uh representative herbert
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
represent representative herbert uh just
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
a couple questions um
 
00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:28.630 align:start position:0%
a couple questions um
is

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
the tax
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
being collected yes
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
there okay so what we turned out not
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay no
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
this is actually an interesting answer
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
evidently when we passed the direct
 
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.790 align:start position:0%
evidently when we passed the direct
to

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
consumer statute
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
last year right we did not include the
 
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
eight percent tax
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
all product will still have to pay
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
whatever their manufacturing tax whether
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
it's 30 cents a gallon for beer or the
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
um whatever the tax rate is
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
for wine and distill is this person
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
i mean are the other retailers that are
 
00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh selling
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
and delivering to places are they
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
audited i mean we do at this point are
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
we just taking their word for it at this
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
point okay
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
we don't uh it's based on that report we
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
saw that there was nobody else was
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of the direct to
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
consumer statute other than abel
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
ebenezer right and then anyway he paid a
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
tax of like three hundred and eleven
 
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.150 align:start position:0%
tax of like three hundred and eleven
dollars

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
and that tax just so you remember if you
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
did the math yep
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
i didn't do the math the second question
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
my understanding the bill that you're
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
citing that we already passed in regards
 
00:41:47.359 --> 00:41:49.190 align:start position:0%
citing that we already passed in regards
to

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
delivery the restaurants can deliver
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
you know alcohol
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
without really
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
knowing who's actually drinking the
 
00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.349 align:start position:0%
knowing who's actually drinking the
alcohol

00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
that was passed in uh
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
in extremis in other words we were in a
 
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.030 align:start position:0%
in extremis in other words we were in a
pandemic

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh the restaurants were struggling
 
00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:08.630 align:start position:0%
uh the restaurants were struggling
mightily

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
mightily
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
to survive
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
well so we'd know the federal government
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
no no that originally was done by the
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
governor's order
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
so the silver lining of having that
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
originally done by a gold the governor's
 
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:21.829 align:start position:0%
originally done by a gold the governor's
order

00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
was that liquor enforcement actually put
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
in the w-2 piece and the no college
 
00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.750 align:start position:0%
in the w-2 piece and the no college
delivery

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
delivery
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
that was actually put in under the
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
governor's order when the governor's
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
order expired there was a period of time
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
where we had nothing and yes we then
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
passed the we basically said that was
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
successful it was a good business model
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
some restaurants continue to want to do
 
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:45.670 align:start position:0%
some restaurants continue to want to do
it

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
and so we then passed the restaurant
 
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
piece outside of covington well my a b
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
question uh you know
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh the reason i believe the public did
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
not get up in arms because you were we
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
were now delivering alcohol to a home
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
and with no
 
00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.670 align:start position:0%
and with no
uh

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
with nobody knowing exactly who's going
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
to be drinking the alcohol
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
but there was a pandemic so there was we
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
did what we could to try and help uh the
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
restaurant businesses
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh who were struggling
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
the pandemic's over
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
right and that's why we passed the
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
direct-to-consumer statutes now
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
has gone all the way into the tent and
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
it's competing against a public system
 
00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:35.510 align:start position:0%
it's competing against a public system
and

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
you know my view in terms of
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
you know financializing public systems
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
um so i'm i do have a problem i i still
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
have the problem there's no checking on
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
who's drinking it
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
and i and i'm i'm skeptical about
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh some people's uh views on whether or
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
not they need to pay taxes
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
are quite extreme and
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
and and and the fact of the matter is
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
the pandemic is over got it the rest
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
okay we got we got that part okay
 
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.430 align:start position:0%
okay we got we got that part okay
so

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
okay we don't need to get this floor we
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
got it represented below
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
is it possible to hear from the liquid
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
commission today
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
it can be we can have him
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh i'll take some other questions and
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
then i'll have them come up and speak
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
okay thanks uh representative fargo was
 
00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%

okay
yep

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
and over here i saw some more hands
 
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh manhattan
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um one thing i'd like
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
to clarify in your email that i believe
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
came out last night um you referenced
 
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
179 colon 15 roman 3 and and you said
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
deleting everything after sealed
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
containers i just would like to clarify
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
that you're only talking about deleting
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
a portion of a sentence and not the
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
whole rest of it correct so yeah and i
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
would have to say that the new amendment
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
is it turns out that that that amendment
 
00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
had the word restaurant in it more than
 
00:44:58.880 --> 00:44:59.589 align:start position:0%
had the word restaurant in it more than
i

00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
was paying attention so uh the next
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
amendment that i hope to have will
 
00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.750 align:start position:0%
amendment that i hope to have will
actually

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
delete the as provided by rsa 179-15
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
but will pick up in 179-115
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
three paragraphs that are in that
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
statute which are the ones that i'm
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
referring to which is the uh
 
00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:20.550 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:21.910 align:start position:0%
the um
[Music]

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
a uh you know having to uh be a w-2
 
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
and that you can't deliver to colleges
 
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay and may i just clarify an earlier
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
point that you made um my belief in
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the three-tier system i'm not
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
saying it's the bl and end all of
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
anything but i think it should be
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
examined um
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean i'm against any
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
industry they've taken advantage of the
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
loopholes the mother may eyes that we've
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
done and so um i am i realize the income
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
that we bring but i also realize that uh
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
it is incumbent upon us sitting here
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
today to make sure that any legislation
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
that we pass going forward regardless of
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
emergency action is one of safety and
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
you you've compared buying a four pack
 
00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.470 align:start position:0%
you you've compared buying a four pack
on

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
on-site in person to having a delivery
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
to the home and you mentioned something
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
about we know that
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
the owner of that liquor now is not
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
over-concerned and there are issues that
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
are they're very different um if i'm on
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
site with a valid id and you can tell
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
that i
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
had too much of a dream as opposed to
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
falling over then chances are good i
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
have not uh over consumed but leaving it
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
at someone's door i think no leaving at
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
the door well no leaving another door no
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
i am well aware of what it says in 179
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
colon 15 and
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
i misspoke on that but nonetheless i
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
think it's a different thing to go back
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
to what chris herbert was saying um to
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
to have someone you know you close the
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
door and the liquor is on the other side
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
of that door i know that there are
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
safeguards that have been put in but i
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
don't think they're adequate anymore i
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
think we put them through for the
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic for the emergency action and
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
that was all well and good for for that
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
time but i think we now have the
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at this more fully
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
and to make it better and more safe uh
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
and i will say that as we well i'm
 
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
actually on the liquor committee i'm
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
free to say that thank you very much
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett thank you mr
 
00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.470 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett thank you mr
chair

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
seems to me with all of these changes um
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
with all of the discussion that to do
 
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.109 align:start position:0%
with all of the discussion that to do
this

00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
to even consider passing this bill
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
without a public hearing
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
would be um not a good idea i think that
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
there are enough stakeholders that would
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
need to be involved
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
um to
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
participate in the in the discussion
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
would be really necessary
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
so you're arguing this is a non-jermaine
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
here uh amendment
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
my argument is that we have not had a
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
public hearing on it and i don't think
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
well this is a publicly
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
no this is a subcommittee
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee publication public okay
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
so you want a public meeting
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
on the amendment so you are claiming
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
this is a non-germain amendment
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
so you would like me to hold a
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
non-germain hearing
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
i would like to have a public hearing on
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
want to do that next wednesday we can do
 
00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.950 align:start position:0%
want to do that next wednesday we can do
that

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
but i i i believe we have session on
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
wednesday i thought session was thursday
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
but thursday we have wednesday and
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
thursday so uh
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
would you like to do it on tuesday
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
i think that we need to have a public
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
hearing on this amendment i will check
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
to see what the clerk's office is that
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
if we can have another public hearing
 
00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.390 align:start position:0%
if we can have another public hearing
okay

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
everybody all set
 
00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.030 align:start position:0%
everybody all set
okay

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry yes representative greeson
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
when uh when
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
somebody stops by the store and picks up
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
a case of beer or whatever it is that
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
they purchase and they go home who
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
drinks it
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
is this a rhetorical question yeah it's
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
it's the argument that's being okay i
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
don't understand but that's the return
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
once it is once it is delivered who's
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
consuming it well once it's purchased at
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
the store who's consuming it okay
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
anyway uh
 
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:02.790 align:start position:0%

and giving it to a private private
business

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%

do you want to have the question posed
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
to you so you know what she's what
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
they're asking for
 
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely if
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
if that's okay yeah that's my preference
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%

thank you and it's good to see you thank
 
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
you for being here um i think my primary
 
00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:07.750 align:start position:0%
you for being here um i think my primary
issue

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
there has to be a safeguard has to be
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
safety here for all involved i realize
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
some things are not going to be 100 all
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
or none but do you feel that this
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
amendment and probably that's not an
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate question for you but does
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
present any loopholes
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
for public safety particularly things
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
like underage drinking things of that
 
00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.030 align:start position:0%
like underage drinking things of that
sort

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
sort
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question uh
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
so i think i
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
are i hope by now after five years uh
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
most of you know that
 
00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:46.790 align:start position:0%
most of you know that
um

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
i have three
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
spokes my wheel that i'm very concerned
 
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.589 align:start position:0%
spokes my wheel that i'm very concerned
about

00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:50:51.599 --> 00:50:52.870 align:start position:0%
about
always

00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
always
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
industry safety community safety and
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
the restricted age
 
00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:58.950 align:start position:0%
the restricted age
access

00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
um that vulnerable age group is
 
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
something that i pay a lot of attention
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
to and that's why i appreciate your
 
00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.710 align:start position:0%
to and that's why i appreciate your
question

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
more so than the rest of the questions
 
00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.230 align:start position:0%
more so than the rest of the questions
um

00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
what ends up happening here is is quite
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
frankly and and
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh it was i i think
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
brought up a little earlier
 
00:51:19.839 --> 00:51:21.510 align:start position:0%
brought up a little earlier
um

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the access as the
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
access point and the access point is
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
point of purchase
 
00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.349 align:start position:0%
point of purchase
so

00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh our major concern is that the person
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
that is actually taking control of this
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
alcohol is of legal age
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
and and quite frankly a signing
 
00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
with the delivery service signing for
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
that alcohol
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
um and they
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
uh fall into the categories of no
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
outward signs of intoxication
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
is a person that is able to because of
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
the age restriction or non-age
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
restriction able to take custody of that
 
00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:07.910 align:start position:0%
restriction able to take custody of that
alcohol

00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
may follow up
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
to address my question a little bit more
 
00:52:13.119 --> 00:52:14.309 align:start position:0%
to address my question a little bit more
fully

00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
fully
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
do you see any further loopholes that
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
are created
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
by this amendment again and i do
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
recognize that this is not going to be
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
perfect as as the representative
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned before i can buy alcohol and
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
then have
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
17 17 year olds in my home
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
which of course is another law and
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
another issue but do you see that this
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
is any
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
other safety ramifications here that
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
have not been addressed or that we
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps should look at rather than
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
going forward with
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
reserve the
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
the issue of there could be a
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
scenario out there i will just share a
 
00:52:56.309 --> 00:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
little bit with you when we got um
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
advised of what was going on with this
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
amendment we went scenario based on it
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
and that we do that quite frequently we
 
00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
go scenario base and and we tried to
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
beat this up into the late
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
i will say the late hours of the night
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
um we were pushing actually this morning
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out what
 
00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559 align:start position:0%
scenario would actually create
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
a a breach in the system
 
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
of of ajax or restricted age access and
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
we didn't come up with one that's not to
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
say one isn't there
 
00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:31.990 align:start position:0%
say one isn't there
but

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
in in the two to three people that we
 
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
had together uh covering field
 
00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.390 align:start position:0%
had together uh covering field
operations

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh myself the deputy uh in our
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
administration our licensing side of the
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
house um we we did not come up with a
 
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
scenario that would breach
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh that other than an unresponsible
 
00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.630 align:start position:0%
uh that other than an unresponsible
adult

00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
adult
 
00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:53.990 align:start position:0%
adult
that

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.349 align:start position:0%
that
disseminates

00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
disseminates
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
double disseminates if that's a term
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
gives the alcohol to which is a totally
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
different issue which i have issue of
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
and i've spoken publicly about before
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
also and that's
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
parents or or adults of legal age giving
 
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
and i respect what you said that you
 
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
didn't find that that loophole that may
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
may well be there and i would just like
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
to comment on that and and thank you for
 
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
your your statement um it is probably
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
best in our best interest for something
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
that's coming up now and we haven't even
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
seen the amendment to look for that
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
loophole to look uh to study to have
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
public testimony to do our due diligence
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
here because um i appreciate that you
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
spent half your night doing this for us
 
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
but you you yourself say that there may
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
well be a loophole an unintended
 
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
loophole and um i i i'm on the liquor
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and have been on the liquor
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee not because i'm an expert
 
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
on any of this but because my concerns
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
are typically things like um underage
 
00:54:59.839 --> 00:55:00.870 align:start position:0%
are typically things like um underage
drinking

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
drinking
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
vaping things of that sort and i'm
 
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
coming at it from that perspective and
 
00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:05.510 align:start position:0%
coming at it from that perspective and
i'm

00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
fairly sure now from your comment that
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
we need to do a little bit more to add
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
to the due diligence that you've already
 
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
done in order to come to the table with
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
something that would be workable and
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
doable for our constituents for people
 
00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:17.750 align:start position:0%
doable for our constituents for people
who

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
are looking to us to bring some wisdom
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
to the table thank you
 
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative bartlett
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
so i guess one of my questions would
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
addressing what you were saying about um
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
somebody buying for underage
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
my feeling is it's not uncommon
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
for someone of age to purchase liquor
 
00:55:43.119 --> 00:55:44.630 align:start position:0%
for someone of age to purchase liquor
beer

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
beer
 
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.589 align:start position:0%
beer
wine

00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
wine
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
for somebody under age happens all the
 
00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.589 align:start position:0%
for somebody under age happens all the
time

00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
this certainly would make it easier
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you agree
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question uh
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative and and
 
00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:03.349 align:start position:0%
representative and and
i

00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
i feel like i'm at the old garden with
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
obstructed view um
 
00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.109 align:start position:0%
obstructed view um
i

00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
i i would say that i don't
 
00:56:11.839 --> 00:56:12.630 align:start position:0%
i i would say that i don't
i

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
this is a problem
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
i we we have talked about it
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
um and and it's always been a concern of
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
mine i don't know if it creates any more
 
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
than the rest of the system
 
00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:26.069 align:start position:0%
than the rest of the system
um

00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
it creates
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh the same hurdles that we would have
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
in a combination a grocery store
 
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
as we would have in takeout service as
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
we would have
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
and quite possibly
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
i hope this doesn't happen and we
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it because we are pretty
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
strict with our our state-owned stores
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
but it could happen in our state-owned
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
stores also
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
once once the consumer gets custody of
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
of that that consumable product
 
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
we hope that they use their best
 
00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:04.230 align:start position:0%
we hope that they use their best
discretion

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
and in making those good choices
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
and being responsible um that's why we
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
have laws in this state that's why we
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
rely on all of you
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
graciously to to create them
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
um so i i don't i don't think my my
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
humble opinion i don't think it creates
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
more but it it creates it the the same
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
concerns are there as the rest of the
 
00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.990 align:start position:0%
concerns are there as the rest of the
industry

00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
masculine yes sir
 
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:36.549 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
in the example of the liquor store
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with a liquor employee
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
who won his jobs on the line if he
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
knows that or the possibility seems to
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
exist that this liquor is going to be
 
00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:51.990 align:start position:0%
exist that this liquor is going to be
just

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
given to somebody under age and they are
 
00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:55.430 align:start position:0%
given to somebody under age and they are
trained

00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
trained
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
um those in a grocery store again
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
they're trained i mean i they card me
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
when i
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
when i buy liquor because it goes
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
through the computer
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
but do you think
 
00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
by lifting all limits
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
i mean there's not going to be any
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
limits to how much can be brought to a
 
00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:15.109 align:start position:0%
limits to how much can be brought to a
residence

00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:21.190 align:start position:0%
 
neither

00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
neither
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
the delivery or the
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
those are accepting i mean it's pretty
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
much a confidential
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
type of transaction wouldn't you agree
 
00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.230 align:start position:0%
type of transaction wouldn't you agree
um

00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
so the limits that thank you again the
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
limits that are there
 
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
what this
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
what i see when this was um
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
proposed to us what i see is this
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
creating parody
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
um we're neutral on this as an agency
 
00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.270 align:start position:0%
um we're neutral on this as an agency
but

00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
the combinations who have been able to
 
00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
deliver and i call them combination
 
00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
grocery store
 
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
convenience store they've been able to
 
00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.430 align:start position:0%
convenience store they've been able to
deliver

00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
deliver
 
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
gosh way before my existence here um and
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
and they have no limits
 
00:59:06.079 --> 00:59:06.950 align:start position:0%
and they have no limits
so

00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
those same concerns
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
and for us as an enforcement group those
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
same concerns
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
are are already there with other
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
like i say
 
00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
grocery stores whether it's hannifer
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
shaw's market basket they can do that
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
they've been able to do that
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
all the way back to i think the
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
existence of that license type the
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
grocery stores don't have liquor
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
no they wine and they have beer no and
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
so by you know lifting
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
and allowing this for
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
all types of alcohol um does change the
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
equation wouldn't you agree it it does
 
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
um because of the um the volume of
 
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.710 align:start position:0%
um because of the um the volume of
alcohol

00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
but again the standard what we use as a
 
00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:56.950 align:start position:0%
but again the standard what we use as a
standard

00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:57.750 align:start position:0%
standard
is

00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
the same standard straight across the
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
board so we don't look at it would be
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
like looking at drugs
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
differently like some drugs are more
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
acceptable than other drugs drugs that
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
are illegal are illegal straight across
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
the board and we look at the alcohol and
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
the youth access as the same way
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's liquor just because it's a
 
01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:18.559 align:start position:0%
wine cooler doesn't make it more
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
acceptable than a bottle of vodka it
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
we don't look at it that way
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative fargo
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
hi it's nice to see you again hi nice to
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
see you um in your estimation does this
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
legislation give competitive edge to a
 
01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
company that has the potential to
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
possibly undermine the new hampshire
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
that i don't know
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh and the only reason i say that is
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
we're on the enforcement side of it
 
01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
and and not on the marketing side to
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
actually talk to the people that
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
my counterparts on the marketing side of
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
the house that actually run the stores
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
to see if there is a competitive edge or
 
01:01:03.119 --> 01:01:03.990 align:start position:0%
to see if there is a competitive edge or
not

01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:01:06.309 --> 01:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
um i look at this from an enforcement
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
point of view
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
in a regulatory point of view thank you
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative abel
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you for uh
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
answering some difficult questions um
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
my question goes back to
 
01:01:22.319 --> 01:01:23.670 align:start position:0%
my question goes back to
to

01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
representative herbert's comment earlier
 
01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.309 align:start position:0%
representative herbert's comment earlier
um

01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
would this pose any new problems
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
for for
 
01:01:34.079 --> 01:01:35.430 align:start position:0%
for for
auditing

01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
auditing
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
uh or
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
ensuring that
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
that the appropriate tax
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and i can answer that
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
question for you so
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
the the tax that we're speaking about
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
for the manufacturers is paid based on
 
01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:55.839 align:start position:0%
what they're manufacturing there is no
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
tax paid on what they're delivering so
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
this doesn't change the tax that's
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
collected or the auditing of the tax for
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing purposes
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
i think what the tax that everyone is
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
referencing is the out-of-state direct
 
01:02:10.559 --> 01:02:11.829 align:start position:0%
referencing is the out-of-state direct
shippers

01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
shippers
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
there is a tax collected with what they
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
ship in that's not the case to the
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
in-state consumers so in terms of
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
auditing for tax purposes the tax the
 
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
this doesn't change what the
 
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturers report what they're
 
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and the taxes that they
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
thank you i was trying to figure out
 
01:02:38.079 --> 01:02:39.190 align:start position:0%
thank you i was trying to figure out
um

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
so with this i just want to make sure i
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
want to clarify something
 
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
so if
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
they are delivering directly to the
 
01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.870 align:start position:0%
they are delivering directly to the
consumer

01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.069 align:start position:0%
consumer
and

01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
they pay their taxes that they have to
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
pay based on their deliveries and
 
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
that's not taking away from it's
 
01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
actually inc could be increasing our
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
state sales
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
tax because we're getting more people
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
buying it directly from them and we
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
still have the state
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
doing their liquor
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
so we're actually increasing sales
 
01:03:11.359 --> 01:03:13.589 align:start position:0%
so we're actually increasing sales
correct

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard to say because the tax
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
isn't based on the delivery of the
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
products the tax is based on what they
 
01:03:19.359 --> 01:03:20.870 align:start position:0%
products the tax is based on what they
manufacture

01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
manufacture
 
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.069 align:start position:0%
manufacture
so

01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
could it increase their manufacturing i
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
don't know it it's it's the potential is
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
there the potential the potential is
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
there so that we could increase our tax
 
01:03:30.319 --> 01:03:31.430 align:start position:0%
there so that we could increase our tax
revenues

01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
because now we're not only delivering
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
through our state liquor stores and
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
such but also through our direct
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturing deliveries
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
correct this is thank you to the direct
 
01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.549 align:start position:0%
correct this is thank you to the direct
manufacturing

01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
01:03:44.559 --> 01:03:45.430 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
okay

01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
so i just had a conversation with the
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
house clerk and uh he agrees uh uh with
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
the um the issue of this being a
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
non-germane amendment
 
01:03:59.430 --> 01:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
and uh unfortunately we're out of time
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
to have a non-germane hearing
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
so uh at this point uh
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment is
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
withdrawn well actually we didn't
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
actually put a motion forward um but i
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
will all i can say is um
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
stay tuned
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
the bill might show up somewhere else
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
i can't we can't pass this bill at this
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
time we can't it this cannot take it
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
effect so at this point the pending
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
motion is uh
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.670 align:start position:0%
is uh
itl

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
itl
 
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
um so what happens i would like us to
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
reconsider that and interim study
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
the the bill
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
so that this amendment can always be
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.109 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:47.119 --> 01:04:48.950 align:start position:0%
so
so

01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:49.910 align:start position:0%
so
i

01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
okay what oh
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
i don't hold any secrets yes i'm going
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
to go over to the senate and give this
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to the senate
 
01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:58.309 align:start position:0%
amendment to the senate
okay

01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
this is a senate bill if gary daniels
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
wants it to happen
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
he'll find a home for it and we'll see
 
01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.270 align:start position:0%
he'll find a home for it and we'll see
it

01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
in the committee conference okay so i'm
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
confused we had an itl on a subcommittee
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
so right now the subcommittee pending
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
motions itl
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
um clearly
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh clearly i i'm not you know i'm not
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
happy with an itl motion because
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
obviously i kept working on this bill
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
thinking that there was a solution so at
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
this point i would uh like the
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to change its motion to
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
or we can not do that it'll just take up
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
interim study when we when we take it up
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
as a full committee okay so that's your
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
motion is interesting you'll be interim
 
01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
study on this bill okay thanks
 
01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.789 align:start position:0%
study on this bill okay thanks
okay

01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
i guess we can just leave it at that we
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
don't you know i'm gonna
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
have to have the subcommittee take any
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
action but i do want to the key thing is
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
i i did want to have everybody have an
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity to express their concerns
 
01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
and thoughts and about what this what
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
this bill what we're trying to do here
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
so at least no one can say when we get
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
to committee conference or this does
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
reappear that you can't say that you've
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
never heard about this before so and i'm
 
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
really confused now though
 
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
we had a subcommittee on april 14th
 
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
correct and that was itl four to one
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
now you're saying
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
we're not having a subcommittee on this
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh i i
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
i we could do would you like to have a
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on it do you want to
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
reconsider we could either a we could re
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
reconsider our action
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
because i'm completely confused now
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
because you were just talking about
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
that i'm the senate bill 340
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
can't get out of th you because i would
 
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
want this amendment because this
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
amendment can't be attached to it
 
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
and for all kinds of purposes that
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm suggesting that we would hold on
 
01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
to 340
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
so that if nothing ever happens to this
 
01:06:52.319 --> 01:06:53.510 align:start position:0%
so that if nothing ever happens to this
amendment

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
the rest of the session at least we have
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee so we can continue to
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
work on it and have a public hearing on
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment well i guess we won't
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
even need to bother with that because
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
it'll come up come in as a separate
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
bills so how does this go into the
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
calendar so you rather have just you
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
just rather kill it i just well i guess
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
the only reason i wouldn't want to kill
 
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
it is i wouldn't want anybody to get up
 
01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
on the house floor
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
when the committee conference comes over
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
and refuses the committee conference on
 
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
the grounds that that well actually no
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
it's not because this language is
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
totally different that's the whole point
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
so you can never argue that 340 this is
 
01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
340. no that i take it back i'm all
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
i was worried that that someone would
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
argue against if this amendment showed
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
up in another bill
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
would argue against this amendment
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
by saying
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
that we killed the bill
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
but we really didn't because there's
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
nothing in this amendment that really
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
actually refers to the original bill
 
01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.990 align:start position:0%
actually refers to the original bill
so

01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
right now we're at itl out of the
 
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which means we're going to
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
execute in a few minutes correct and the
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation out of the subcommittee
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
is itl at this point so that would be
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
the motion in the exact session that's
 
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
fine and then if that were to pass that
 
01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.710 align:start position:0%
fine and then if that were to pass that
way

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
it goes on to the calendar
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
as itl
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
as far as i'm concerned send it on the
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
consent calendar and send it on its way
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
okay guys i think yes representative
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
chair it appears to me there are two
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
ways forward with respect to interim
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
study and i'm wondering which one you
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
prefer at this point so we can move
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
things along yeah the first is you could
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee can reconsider its itl
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
and and it yes it can just know
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
we could we could reconsider it and then
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
no interim study so but i don't know if
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
we don't need it so
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
the the the subcommittee could
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
reconsider its itl and then vote is as a
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation for the exact session or
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
we can just kill itl when it comes
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
before the full committee in the exec
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
session and then do i s so do you have a
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
preference for which
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
course of action you wish to take
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
at this point uh i just assume leave it
 
01:09:01.759 --> 01:09:02.709 align:start position:0%
at this point uh i just assume leave it
at

01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
it so we'll take it up in the executive
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
session and we'll deal with the itl and
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
itl is fine
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
you itl is fine you just itl is fine you
 
01:09:17.349 --> 01:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
just want to keep okay it was a bad idea
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
to just raise the dollar and
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
that was a bad idea so no interim study
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
itl going forward okay thank you
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
just have a question are we gonna caucus
 
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
before exec yes
 
01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.309 align:start position:0%
before exec yes
okay

01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
all right representative van halen at
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
the risk of being obtuse or more of
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
juice than usual you said you would take
 
01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
the uh amendment over to the senate
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
correct did you clarify
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
what the process is for that and why
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
you're doing that uh senate has uh no
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
rules about non-germain amendments
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
but they've they're already done with
 
01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
this bill right
 
01:09:53.839 --> 01:09:54.790 align:start position:0%
this bill right
i

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
the fact that the bill was sitting on
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
the table in the senate and they took it
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
off and passed it
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
on their last day
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
evidently they're not done with it
 
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
and they will probably be dancing in the
 
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
street when they see me coming
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
so to be continued correct
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:16.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
any more discussion all right and
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh 319 we we do yeah we have pending
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
action on that so there's no need for
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
another subcommittee okay so uh
 
01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:28.390 align:start position:0%
another subcommittee okay so uh
the

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee session for the commerce
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
committee is closed bam
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
okay and so we'll uh take what happened
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
to 319
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
right we'll we we already know what
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to do with 319
 
01:10:41.679 --> 01:10:43.189 align:start position:0%
we're going to do with 319
right

01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:10:43.199 --> 01:10:44.310 align:start position:0%
right
where

01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
we'll have a reconsideration on our
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
previous motion
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
okay i had that on the subcommittee work
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
session i know i told you i put
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
everything out of habit i just put
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
everything on sub command
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
that was just out of habit
 
01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.310 align:start position:0%
that was just out of habit
okay

01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:39.120 --> 01:24:02.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:03.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
are we ready
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
everybody in i guess i should count
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.629 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
senate bill 202 prohibiting the sale of
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
cosmetic products tested on animals
 
01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:32.950 align:start position:0%
cosmetic products tested on animals
representative

01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
johnson second by representative terry
 
01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
moves ought to pass on the amendment
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
and for the record
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment will need one uh typo
 
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
call it that
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh in which uh evidently the reference
 
01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.470 align:start position:0%
uh in which uh evidently the reference
uh

01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:53.270 align:start position:0%
uh
in

01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
roman numeral two b the reference to the
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
food and drug and cosmetic act 21 usc
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
okay so it's line 22 if you have a bill
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
have you had the amendment in front of
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
you with numbers on it
 
01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0%
21 on the amendment and
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
page 2 page 2
 
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
301 it should be it says 350.
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment replaces the entire bill
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
so at this point we're only we so we
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about the
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
we can say you know that somebody else
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
screwed up and before we got it but but
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
it was uh at this point this amendment
 
01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
is um repens the bill by replacing all
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
after the enacting clause so we're
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
replacing everything in the original
 
01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:52.830 align:start position:0%
replacing everything in the original
bill

01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:54.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
all right any discussion on the motion
 
01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:57.669 align:start position:0%
all right any discussion on the motion
of

01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on the amendment
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative abel
 
01:26:07.110 --> 01:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
yes i believe that the original bill is
 
01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
a much superior bill to
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
the amended bill and so i urge everyone
 
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
to vote against
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
okay representative van hounten
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
thank you just to reiterate what i said
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
during the subcommittee it uh it is way
 
01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
too broad a bill
 
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
it may have unattended consequences may
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
have loopholes that are going to be big
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
enough to drive a truck through and it
 
01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
would quite likely make us the first
 
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
state to have this type of legislation
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that without further
 
01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
study it would be a good
 
01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
a good thing for us to be first so i
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
will um
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
um i will vote accordingly thank you
 
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
myself personally i was opposed to this
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
bill from the get-go
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
because of all the exemptions
 
01:26:59.910 --> 01:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
yes i think there
 
01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
this is this is a convoy when when you
 
01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
have a bill that's one sentence
 
01:27:07.110 --> 01:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
and even in the initial sentence the
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
cosmetic it had but not soap it already
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
had an exemption already in the in the
 
01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
definition and then went on and had a
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
second page full of exemptions
 
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
which would always caution me to want to
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
be in support of that bill however
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
that once the concept of saying is but
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
why don't we just
 
01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
not pick on one industry
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
let's just say make a statement which is
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
what this is all it is if you ask me
 
01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:36.639 align:start position:0%
make a statement that says that in new
 
01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire we don't want you testing for
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
animals for any reason
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
and yes we understand that
 
01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals and medical products and
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
governments will require companies to do
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
the testing but that's part of the
 
01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
convoy of exemptions that are in here
 
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative bilo
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i um support i'm supporting the
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:03.350 align:start position:0%
original bill
because

01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
it was proven to me that cosmetics can
 
01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
be tested
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
on um
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
in in labs versus on animals so it's you
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
you they will be able to still
 
01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:16.790 align:start position:0%
you they will be able to still
manufacture

01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
manufacture
 
01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
but they won't be able to test the other
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
exact exemptions they need to use
 
01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:24.400 align:start position:0%
animals so that's why there's an
 
01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.790 align:start position:0%
animals so that's why there's an
exception

01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
exception
 
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
i i don't get that but it's your opinion
 
01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
just to share yes representative thank
 
01:28:33.199 --> 01:28:36.470 align:start position:0%
just to share yes representative thank
you

01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
taking into consideration
 
01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:40.870 align:start position:0%
taking into consideration
the

01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
federal exemptions as outlined at least
 
01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:46.390 align:start position:0%
federal exemptions as outlined at least
partially

01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
partially

01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%

cosmetics or something else
 
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
that is causing me pain
 
01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:01.830 align:start position:0%

cruelty

01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
cruelty
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
is cruelty
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
and so just to select out cosmetics and
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
cosmetic manufacturers
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be particularly cruel to
 
01:29:10.719 --> 01:29:11.750 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be particularly cruel to
animals

01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
animals
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%

chairman hunt yes 10 to 9.
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
i assume there'll be a minority report
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
mr chair i have i haven't polo i have a
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
question about the proposed amendment
 
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
there is it there there needs to be a
 
01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
correction correct the number that 303
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
so how will that be handled
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
so we'll we'll make that correction and
 
01:31:58.470 --> 01:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that the right amendment is
 
01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:05.669 --> 01:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
so i mean you mean
 
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
i mean in terms of um
 
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
the senate doesn't that you know they do
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
that all the time
 
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
but i don't normally is on policy i
 
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
would never do that um but in this case
 
01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
it's pretty straightforward and the fact
 
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
that that number was a problem from day
 
01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:21.510 align:start position:0%
that that number was a problem from day
one

01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:22.470 align:start position:0%
one
um

01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
you know i i don't think that we need to
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
unless you don't want to send this bill
 
01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:28.590 align:start position:0%
to the floor and
 
01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:30.470 align:start position:0%
to the floor and
[Music]

01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
i mean i i mean in terms of the
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
amendment we can sit we can wait till
 
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
i just don't think it's right okay
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
all right so will be a minority yes
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
representative bolio will do it
 
01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:48.950 align:start position:0%
representative bolio will do it
okay

01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
and your motion will be
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
no your their motion would be odd to
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:02.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
okay we're on to the next one
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
senate bill 355 requiring online
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
marketplaces to disclose certain
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
so representative terry seconded by
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative osborne
 
01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:24.870 align:start position:0%
representative osborne
moves

01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the motion of interim
 
01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:29.990 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the motion of interim
study

01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative weston now i really
 
01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
strongly support this bill i don't i
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
think the interim study will just be a
 
01:33:38.229 --> 01:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
quiet death and i think we should pass
 
01:33:38.239 --> 01:33:38.950 align:start position:0%
quiet death and i think we should pass
it

01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
i sent around a new york times article
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
last weekend
 
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
which really outlines the problems with
 
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.110 align:start position:0%
which really outlines the problems with
amazon

01:33:47.110 --> 01:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
amazon
 
01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
that they just don't consider themselves
 
01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
a seller and they get away with
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
having third-party
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
sellers that are just not reputable and
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
if someone tries to pursue those
 
01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
third-party sellers amazon pretty much
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
just tells them to go pound sand so this
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
is not about the small marketplace the
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
individual marketplace this is
 
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
about amazon and i think it needs to be
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
controlled i think this bill should pass
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to vote against interim
 
01:34:16.239 --> 01:34:17.990 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to vote against interim
study

01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
okay representative van gaal
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
thank you i agree i think that
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
this is there's an immediacy to this
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
bill anyone who watches um the news
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
local local news manchester has been hit
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
in some high profile uh smash and grab
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
types of things
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
realizes that that the longer we allow
 
01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
this to go on the longer the bad actors
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
are able to become sophisticated with us
 
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
and a interim study will just delay
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
something that retail and consumers are
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
crying for and if we're not here for
 
01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
both of those parties retail and
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
consumers both um then who are we here
 
01:34:54.629 --> 01:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
for so i think it's time that we we
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
address this um
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
rather than to put it on the table for
 
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
interim study thank you
 
01:35:02.310 --> 01:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
so representative weston i i do want to
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
say thank you for sending that along um
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
and been telling me to make sure i read
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
the last sentence which i might not have
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh and which has said the federal
 
01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
legislation is still live
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
it's still on a bill
 
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's stalled everything's stalled
 
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
so but in terms of normally this
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
committee if there
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
if things that are still going on in the
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh in washington we usually wait until
 
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
the dust settle i.e when it came to
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
extern you know um extra uh external
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
review not really external but uh um
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
balanced billing uh that you know why
 
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't it make sense to wait until
 
01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
after the federal government has acted
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
and then take take an action i think
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of i think there are a lot
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
of cases where we don't do that
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
where we try to push things through in
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
spite of the fact that it should be a
 
01:35:48.239 --> 01:35:49.189 align:start position:0%
spite of the fact that it should be a
federal

01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh law and a lot of times we really opt
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
for a state solution instead
 
01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
i think that happens all the time i'm
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
sure it does but this is this one is
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
clearly the state is really in inept all
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
it can do is ask
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
amazon to go do its homework it really
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
has no authority it doesn't it really
 
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
can't force them to do anything it can't
 
01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
shut them down it can't force them to do
 
01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
something differently there are states
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
that are enacting this now we're not
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
alone on this this is happening across
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
the country
 
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
and i think it also sends a message we
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
do influence what the marketplace does
 
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
we do it oh i mean i i know from other
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh experiences like the pfas thing
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
are the motions that were taking place
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
in vermont affected the entire industry
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
for ski wax so i we can we can make a
 
01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
difference and i think this is an
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity yeah i think it gives them
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
false impression that that there there's
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
somebody out there really doing
 
01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:47.669 align:start position:0%
somebody out there really doing
something

01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:36:47.679 --> 01:36:49.189 align:start position:0%
something
representative

01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:36:49.199 --> 01:36:50.149 align:start position:0%
representative
bartlett

01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
bartlett
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um with all due
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
respect i do see a difference between
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
your example regarding balanced billing
 
01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
which is in the courts
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
um different than what legislation that
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
is being worked on no it's big pieces of
 
01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
the balance bill
 
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
section that is in courts and that was
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
why we put off any further movement on
 
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
that one okay
 
01:37:15.109 --> 01:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:15.119 --> 01:37:15.990 align:start position:0%
 
nope

01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
nope
 
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
i'm

01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
it's my flaming red hair yeah
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
i agree with the idea
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
get away with their crimes we want to
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
bust them knowing no one is trying to
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
enable or
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
in any other way try to make it easy for
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
them to get away with their crimes we
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
certainly want them arrested we want
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
them punished
 
01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
one of my concerns about the bill as it
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
is written
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
is that it is targeting
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
a very select few retail outlets
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
and ignoring
 
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
what would be much easier
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
outlets for the sale of stolen property
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's not to say that amazon doesn't have
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
stolen goods it's not to say amazon or
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
of these large retail don't have
 
01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:22.310 align:start position:0%
of these large retail don't have
uh

01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
counterfeits or anything like that
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
but the problem is is is that
 
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
knowing what the requirements are to be
 
01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
a third-party seller on those platforms
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
and not having those same requirements
 
01:38:39.669 --> 01:38:39.679 align:start position:0%
at other outlets such as an ebay or a
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
craigslist or things like that this bill
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
totally ignores those smaller outlets
 
01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
and so i i i think that if we're going
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
to do something let's make sure that we
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
are actually
 
01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:52.709 align:start position:0%
are actually
targeting

01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
targeting
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
where we we need to be looking where we
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
actually need to be looking i think
 
01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
amazon is an easy scapegoat because
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
they're so large and if we need to
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
address them yes well let's do that but
 
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
i think we're ignoring so many other
 
01:39:05.669 --> 01:39:05.679 align:start position:0%
outlets to be able to sell those the
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
smash and grab
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
looted looted goods so i i think an
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
interim study would would allow us to
 
01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
better tailor the bill to where we
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
representing manhattan thank you mr
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
chair uh just a couple of follow-up
 
01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:25.669 align:start position:0%
chair uh just a couple of follow-up
points

01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
points
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking here about the potential
 
01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:28.310 align:start position:0%
we're talking here about the potential
for

01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:39:31.510 --> 01:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
counterfeit drugs and medications too so
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
if we if we are looking at stalling
 
01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
something that's important for the
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
consumer as well as for the retailer
 
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.270 align:start position:0%
consumer as well as for the retailer
whose

01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
whose
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
inventory is being stolen in a smash and
 
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
grab and granted it is the big guys the
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
big guys are the ones that are most
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
responsible i'd also i really would like
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
just to point out that there's a
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
contingency at the end at the end of the
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
bill which has to do with federal
 
01:39:53.199 --> 01:39:54.390 align:start position:0%
bill which has to do with federal
legislation

01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
and uh it says
 
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
there's similar federal legislation
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
requiring online marketplaces to verify
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
and disclose certain information if it
 
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
has become law prior to january 1 2023
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
section one of the sex shall not take
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
effect so we are kind of covering our
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
bases all the way around we are saying
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire uh supports consumers
 
01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
supports retailers and supports the idea
 
01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
that um bad actors benefit from
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
anonymity and so if we take away their
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
anonymity then we take away that that
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
veil of crime from them as i i indicated
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
to do with our with my seat made here
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
when i attempted to take her phone um i
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
i have my name plate here i have my
 
01:40:38.229 --> 01:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
badge here if i'm going to be a bad
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
actor i'm not going to do it unless i'm
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
anonymous and so i really think that it
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
is time for us to step up on behalf of
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
of of these people and we're not hurting
 
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
amazon we're not hurting those big
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
people or just asking them to be
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
accountable for the same thing that a
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
brick and mortar store is accountable
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
for so um with that said i just would
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
like to point out again there is a
 
01:41:01.590 --> 01:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
contingency here and so uh there is a
 
01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
chance for us to do something
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
before the remainder of the states which
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
are multiples 24 plus states or at least
 
01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
considering it uh before the multiples
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh do it and we'll be part of that
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
federal action if it happens
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
that's interesting you brought in brick
 
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
and mortar
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
this doesn't include brick and mortar so
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
therefore a brick and mortar person
 
01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
could have bought a trailer load of
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
illegal or stolen products and sell it
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
at half price and nobody would know the
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
difference but we have the information
 
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
on those people so once we detect that
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
something is still they stole it they
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
did rick and we don't have any
 
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
requirements on a brick and mortar to
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
tell us who their distributor or where
 
01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
the how they get their product but
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
they're culpable the brick and mortar
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
store the seller is couple so i go back
 
01:41:42.239 --> 01:41:43.030 align:start position:0%
store the seller is couple so i go back
to

01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
to the brick and mortar walmart and say
 
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
this is a counterfeit drug this is a the
 
01:41:49.990 --> 01:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
um the serial number is shaved off the
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
bottom of this bicycle frame uh they are
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
culpable they are accountable the ag can
 
01:41:56.070 --> 01:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
then step in and take a look at that
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
because we know who they are we know
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
their phone number we know whatever we
 
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
know contact information
 
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
and so we should at least know that
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
about our online retailers as well uh
 
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
resellers i should say
 
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
i guess not resellers
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i just would like to remind the
 
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
committee members that we had a police
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
chief um testifying
 
01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh regarding smash and grabs and in
 
01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
regards to this bill and he was in full
 
01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
support of this bill thank you
 
01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:24.629 align:start position:0%
support of this bill thank you
yeah

01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay you know i i but
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
to me smash and grab implies you did not
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
take the packaging with it and this bill
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
legislation specifically says
 
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
it has to be in its original
 
01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:39.590 align:start position:0%
it has to be in its original
packaging

01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
packaging
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
so in most of smash and grabs i have
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
when i see when someone steal a rolex
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
they're not looking in the cabinet for
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
the the box the rolex came in
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative bartlett but we
 
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
certainly have um the examples right in
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
manchester of the atvs the golf carts
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
they were all they were stolen
 
01:42:57.270 --> 01:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
in the truckload in their original
 
01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:59.030 align:start position:0%
in the truckload in their original
crates

01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
crates
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
and they were new
 
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
in their original package packaging i
 
01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
guess i missed that one i just saw the
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
guy with the 80 you sold 80 100 billion
 
01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:12.390 align:start position:0%

is there any more discussion on the
motion

01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:18.080 align:start position:0%

i no longer have red hair
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill requires any proof
 
01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:29.990 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill requires any proof
of

01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.430 align:start position:0%
of
ownership

01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
ownership
 
01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:32.310 align:start position:0%
ownership
or

01:43:32.310 --> 01:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
right to sell
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
a product
 
01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
how do we know how does amazon know
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
that johnny bob has the right to sell
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
the goods there's nothing to say that
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
that 10 000 units of maybelline mascara
 
01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
he didn't pilfer from revco or whatever
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
you know he there's nothing to show
 
01:43:57.990 --> 01:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
that he has the right to sell it
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
and so this bill does not deal with that
 
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
so this master grade is not going to do
 
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
anything with whether knowing it's
 
01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
stolen goods or not okay i think we're
 
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:09.040 align:start position:0%

01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
i have to vote against this motion i
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
feel this is just an enabling bill this
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anybody has to do anything
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
that if a carrier wants to make an
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
incentive an employer wants to offer an
 
01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:06.310 align:start position:0%
incentive an employer wants to offer an
incentive

01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
incentive
 
01:52:08.070 --> 01:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
for a vaccination
 
01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
for this vaccination
 
01:52:10.950 --> 01:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
then i think they should be able to i
 
01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
don't think we should be telling them
 
01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative greeson
 
01:52:19.109 --> 01:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh what this bill
 
01:52:20.790 --> 01:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
also does not do
 
01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:22.870 align:start position:0%
also does not do
is

01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
prevent anyone from taking action
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
against anyone who might refuse said
 
01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:30.470 align:start position:0%
against anyone who might refuse said
incentive

01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
incentive
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
for whatever their reasons i don't want
 
01:52:32.159 --> 01:52:32.950 align:start position:0%
for whatever their reasons i don't want
it

01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh you can enable them to you not only
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
enable them to offer the incentive but
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
you also enable them to punish anyone
 
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
who doesn't take the incentive so that's
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
representing van halen i simply see
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
nothing that would punish anybody
 
01:52:52.629 --> 01:52:52.639 align:start position:0%
incentives are just there if you wish to
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
have them um
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
as we said enabled and if if i wish to
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
take it fine if not i don't see that i'm
 
01:53:01.990 --> 01:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
going to be punished i i think that
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
we're reading something else into the
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
bill there uh i also think that um
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
is we run our world on incentives how
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
many of us incentivize our kids to do
 
01:53:13.350 --> 01:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
their homework by taking away iphones or
 
01:53:15.669 --> 01:53:15.679 align:start position:0%
ipads or whatever the case might be it's
 
01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
simply a way of indicating what you feel
 
01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
is a a just way of doing things and in
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
this case the insurance carrier is
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
potentially saving itself hundreds of
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars with people who for
 
01:53:29.189 --> 01:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
whom the vaccine will keep them out of
 
01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals and keep them healthier and
 
01:53:32.550 --> 01:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
safer and so i think those are
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
considerations that we have to look at
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
as we vote thank you representative
 
01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that a health
 
01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:40.390 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that a health
carrier

01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
carrier
 
01:53:42.629 --> 01:53:42.639 align:start position:0%
is not going to offer an incentive
 
01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
unless they've basically uh created some
 
01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
sort of an algorithm algorithm
 
01:53:49.599 --> 01:53:50.709 align:start position:0%
sort of an algorithm algorithm
whatever

01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
algorithm that that this
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
the cost of the incentive will be far
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
outweighed by the savings of uh of this
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
so i think this is a a whole public
 
01:54:05.310 --> 01:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
health thing i think i think to to
 
01:54:07.270 --> 01:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
disincentivize people
 
01:54:10.229 --> 01:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
um is wrong and i think that's what
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
you're you're trying to do this should
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
incentivize people to to do what uh
 
01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
may be very helpful and and to to
 
01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
prevent them somebody from taking a
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine i i also see how this this whole
 
01:54:27.270 --> 01:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
anti-vax thing could could move over to
 
01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
polio vaccine and some other vaccines
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
which would be extremely dangerous
 
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
extremely uh harmful to uh
 
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
to public health and everybody's else
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
this is a good bill and it should pass
 
01:54:42.030 --> 01:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
you know representative mclare you
 
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely got it right no insurance
 
01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
company could offer this
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
unless they can document that this is
 
01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:51.270 align:start position:0%
unless they can document that this is
actually

01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:52.550 align:start position:0%
actually
a

01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%
will have the benefit that save the
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
hundred thousands of dollars that you
 
01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:58.470 align:start position:0%
hundred thousands of dollars that you
claim

01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
claim
 
01:55:00.390 --> 01:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
because that's the law they can do it
 
01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:01.750 align:start position:0%
because that's the law they can do it
already

01:55:01.750 --> 01:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
if they can come up with that algorithm
 
01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:04.470 align:start position:0%
if they can come up with that algorithm
today

01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:55:06.629 --> 01:55:06.639 align:start position:0%
and figure out that giving away some
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
incentive and no taking away someone's
 
01:55:11.189 --> 01:55:11.199 align:start position:0%
phone is not that somebody could get
 
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
could get ice cream
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
that yeah that absolutely was perfect
 
01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is totally unnecessary
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
and frankly it set the wrong president
 
01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
because it really should go and say you
 
01:55:26.310 --> 01:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
know that you know reaffirm what
 
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
everybody already knows that if
 
01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
insurance company can document and make
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
it make a case i mean i call it with the
 
01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
guy with the green shades but you know
 
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
the algorithm is a good word too so but
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
that yeah you're absolutely right
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
okay representative amen
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wanted to comment it's
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
interesting that the insurance
 
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
corporation is the parent in the uh in
 
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
the in the child parent analogy so i
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:54.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:55:54.149 --> 01:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
okay
