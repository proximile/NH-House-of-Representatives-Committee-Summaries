so essentially the proposed amendment
 

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.150 align:start position:0%
so essentially the proposed amendment
would

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:49.160 align:start position:0%
would
 

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.850 align:start position:0%

um that are presently in 655 and just
 

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.830 align:start position:0%
um that are presently in 655 and just
focus<00:20:55.260><c> on</c><00:20:55.500><c> the</c><00:20:55.620><c> recodification</c><00:20:56.400><c> of</c><00:20:57.000><c> oplc</c><00:20:57.600><c> and</c>

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
focus on the recodification of oplc and
 

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.190 align:start position:0%
focus on the recodification of oplc and
310.<00:20:58.559><c> practically</c><00:20:59.460><c> I</c><00:21:00.360><c> think</c><00:21:00.480><c> as</c><00:21:01.020><c> I've</c>

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
310. practically I think as I've
 

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.110 align:start position:0%
310. practically I think as I've
expressed<00:21:01.620><c> before</c><00:21:01.799><c> it's</c><00:21:02.520><c> quite</c><00:21:02.760><c> difficult</c>

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
expressed before it's quite difficult
 

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.750 align:start position:0%
expressed before it's quite difficult
for<00:21:04.080><c> individuals</c><00:21:04.679><c> to</c><00:21:04.919><c> know</c><00:21:05.100><c> where</c><00:21:05.400><c> to</c><00:21:05.580><c> look</c>

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
for individuals to know where to look
 

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.029 align:start position:0%
for individuals to know where to look
when<00:21:06.539><c> it</c><00:21:06.660><c> comes</c><00:21:06.780><c> to</c><00:21:06.960><c> oplc's</c><00:21:07.559><c> Authority</c>

00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
when it comes to oplc's Authority
 

00:21:08.039 --> 00:21:10.610 align:start position:0%
when it comes to oplc's Authority
because<00:21:08.340><c> it's</c><00:21:08.700><c> tucked</c><00:21:09.059><c> up</c><00:21:09.179><c> before</c><00:21:09.900><c> all</c><00:21:10.320><c> of</c><00:21:10.440><c> the</c>

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
because it's tucked up before all of the
 

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:15.169 align:start position:0%
because it's tucked up before all of the
other<00:21:10.740><c> technical</c><00:21:11.280><c> statutes</c><00:21:11.940><c> in</c><00:21:12.380><c> 310a1</c><00:21:13.380><c> a</c>

00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
other technical statutes in 310a1 a
 

00:21:15.179 --> 00:21:16.909 align:start position:0%
other technical statutes in 310a1 a
um<00:21:15.240><c> and</c><00:21:15.419><c> so</c><00:21:15.480><c> I</c><00:21:15.600><c> think</c><00:21:15.720><c> recodification</c><00:21:16.440><c> is</c><00:21:16.679><c> just</c>

00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
um and so I think recodification is just
 

00:21:16.919 --> 00:21:18.409 align:start position:0%
um and so I think recodification is just
necessary<00:21:17.280><c> in</c><00:21:17.520><c> order</c><00:21:17.700><c> to</c><00:21:17.880><c> provide</c><00:21:18.179><c> that</c>

00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:18.419 align:start position:0%
necessary in order to provide that
 

00:21:18.419 --> 00:21:20.390 align:start position:0%
necessary in order to provide that
transparency<00:21:18.960><c> as</c><00:21:19.320><c> to</c><00:21:19.500><c> what</c><00:21:19.679><c> law</c><00:21:19.980><c> actually</c>

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
transparency as to what law actually
 

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.529 align:start position:0%
transparency as to what law actually
applies

00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:21.539 align:start position:0%

00:21:21.539 --> 00:21:24.409 align:start position:0%

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:24.419 align:start position:0%
additionally one of the objectives that
 

00:21:24.419 --> 00:21:26.390 align:start position:0%

for them to rely on those statutes to
 

00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:04.490 align:start position:0%
for them to rely on those statutes to

some extent we'd have to do that legal
 

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.190 align:start position:0%
some extent we'd have to do that legal
analysis<00:22:05.299><c> but</c><00:22:06.299><c> I</c><00:22:06.419><c> think</c><00:22:06.539><c> it</c><00:22:06.720><c> provides</c><00:22:07.080><c> a</c>

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
analysis but I think it provides a
 

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.529 align:start position:0%
analysis but I think it provides a

consolidating the way we do business and
 

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.370 align:start position:0%
consolidating the way we do business and
I<00:22:11.220><c> think</c><00:22:11.340><c> frankly</c><00:22:11.700><c> it's</c><00:22:11.880><c> pretty</c><00:22:12.120><c> necessary</c>

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
I think frankly it's pretty necessary
