00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
the well you're here to talk about
 
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
whatever you want you know
 
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
um I like to hear first though from
 
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
Emily Barker representing the um
 
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
oh okay so houseboat 655 as you know was
 
00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
a pretty beefy bill
 
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
and all of House Bill 655 was in house
 
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 align:start position:0%
bill 2. the trailer Bill to the budget
 
00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
and so what we've done to make this a
 
00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 align:start position:0%
uh reasonable from a from our community
 
00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 align:start position:0%
standpoint is that we took all the
 
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 align:start position:0%
repeal portion of house bill in House
 
00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 655 and we took that out
 
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
the repeal portion of house bill 655.
 
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
is taken out
 
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.770 align:start position:0%
is taken out
okay

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
all that is gone
 
00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 650 655 is meant to codify
 
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in oplc on the
 
00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 align:start position:0%
organizational level and not on the
 
00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
okay and then House Bill 2
 
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
still has those portions of the repeal
 
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
in it and this committee will have a
 
00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 align:start position:0%
work session on that on Friday at two
 
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
o'clock so we're essentially dividing
 
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
the bill in half
 
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
the oplc portion
 
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
and the board portion
 
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.850 align:start position:0%
and the board portion
okay

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so please miss Barker
 
00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
we need that because I never speak up
 
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
enough I'm Emily Baker I'm a physician
 
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
and the current president for the Board
 
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
of Medicine and I submit submitted a
 
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
document that at your pleasure to read
 
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
so in the um I believe in
 
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 because this has been
 
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
removed from this part of the bill has
 
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
been removed from house bill 655.
 
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
so um do you have some comments about
 
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.969 align:start position:0%
so um do you have some comments about
the

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
medical review board can you speak to
 
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
that because it says a component that
 
00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 align:start position:0%
was in House Bill 655 and we'd like your
 
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
input on that yeah sure
 
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
the medical abuse subcommittee is
 
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
established in statute currently
 
00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 align:start position:0%
as a also comprised of licensees and
 
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
public members
 
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
and does investigations on complaints
 
00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 align:start position:0%
that come in through and right now they
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
come in through the office of oplc
 
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.370 align:start position:0%
come in through the office of oplc
and

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
my understanding at least from my read
 
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
of hb2 was that that was the intent was
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
for that to go away
 
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
and my second paragraph in my document
 
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
lends the boards
 
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
support for some version of a panel
 
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
to review complaints and assist in
 
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.290 align:start position:0%
to review complaints and assist in
investigations

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
and I describe what I think is sort of
 
00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 align:start position:0%
in the value of a panel and it's similar
 
00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 align:start position:0%
to any board where you have
 
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
more than one individual who has
 
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 align:start position:0%
potential for expertise to talk about an
 
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
investigation and make a recommendation
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
and whether or not
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
that continues in the form of where it
 
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
stands in statute currently or falls
 
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
under the Aegis of the oplc with details
 
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 align:start position:0%
sorry okay so on Friday that's going to
 
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
be part of the discussion at two o'clock
 
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
so if you could come back yeah that
 
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate would be an
 
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
appropriate conversation to have at that
 
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
time that's great I will okay thank you
 
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to bring some more copies of
 
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
the document I have no idea if you're
 
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
the exact same group it will be the same
 
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
group and um
 
00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 align:start position:0%
I think what I'll let I'll let the
 
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
committee know when we meet to save this
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
document for Friday okay
 
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
not cut down any more trees yeah exactly
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anything else that
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
you'd like to say did you have any
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
questions about the review of the
 
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
applicants the first part of my
 
00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
good morning Representatives Shane
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
Goulet attorney for the office of
 
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
I am board counsel to the Board of
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
Medicine I just wanted to comment on the
 
00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 align:start position:0%
board's position as it relates to the
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
Authority for issuing licenses there was
 
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
a portion in Dr Baker's letter and
 
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
submissions as it relates to that it's
 
00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
unclear as to what that would look like
 
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
in totality but the board was concerned
 
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
with the ability to review certain
 
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
specific applications as it relates to
 
00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
ones that include past disciplinary
 
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.020 align:start position:0%
actions in other state criminal history
 
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
it's not specific I know that it
 
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
illustrates that it would require input
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
and objective standards that were
 
00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:32.699 align:start position:0%
created by the board so it might not be
 
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
problematic but it was certainly a
 
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
concern of the board that certain
 
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
applications would absolutely need to be
 
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
before the board that contain that type
 
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
of historic information for applicants
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay I'll make a note of that
 
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
this is the sub committee have any
 
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.309 align:start position:0%
this is the sub committee have any
questions

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair
 
00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:04.259 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone uh pardon my being
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
a little bit late
 
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
um so I'm concerned uh with regard to uh
 
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
this the smoothness of the uh the
 
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
procedure that we're potentially
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
embarking on here because uh you know I
 
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
I've been on this committee now for 17
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
years I I saw the
 
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
office of Professional Licensing and
 
00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
certification come in
 
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
roughly 10 or 11 years ago
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
and it was a was a very new operation
 
00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:39.419 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of rough edges I don't
 
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
know how many of you were here at that
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
time uh but now we're embarking on
 
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
something new uh in terms of of
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
procedure at least and my question is
 
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
whether uh what this the workability is
 
00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:57.140 align:start position:0%
going to be as good as uh as it may be
 
00:08:59.170 --> 00:08:59.180 align:start position:0%
after you've
 
00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:03.140 align:start position:0%
uh taken off the rough edges so to speak
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
and do do anticipate uh an easy
 
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
transition a smooth transition to the
 
00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
new procedures or are there certain
 
00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
aspects that uh that you haven't even
 
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:18.200 align:start position:0%
encountered yet or haven't thought about
 
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
uh and so can you can you speak to that
 
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
because I am concerned that especially
 
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
um the the licensees you're you're going
 
00:09:32.329 --> 00:09:32.339 align:start position:0%
to be working into it and you'll have
 
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
repeated instances of it because you're
 
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
doing it every day or every week some of
 
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
the people will be coming in they won't
 
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
have seen it at all and I'm wondering
 
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to go like I am
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
I'm used to turning right at this corner
 
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
like the old milk horse I'm way too old
 
00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:53.459 align:start position:0%
for uh for this group in terms of Mill
 
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
courses but I remember the milk course
 
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
used to turn right at this corner
 
00:09:59.769 --> 00:09:59.779 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to turn the left in the new
 
00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:02.459 align:start position:0%
Administration so can you speak to that
 
00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:04.910 align:start position:0%
Administration so can you speak to that
please

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
I I just want to be clear representative
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
um that I am employed by the office of
 
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
but my capacity here and my capacity
 
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
within that agency is specific to the
 
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
boards uh I represent the boards in
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
their capacity
 
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
um and my testimony here is specific and
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
relative to the Board of Medicine I can
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
say from a process and procedure
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
standpoint as it relates to how the
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine has interacted with
 
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
the office and I defer to Dr Baker to
 
00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
correct me if I State anything
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
inaccurately that it relates to the you
 
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
know expeditious
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
or more
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
expedient issuance of licenses the Board
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
of Medicine is working directly with the
 
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
office to ensure that that occurs kind
 
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
of hand in glove and I I think that the
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
board has been satisfied by the efforts
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
that the office has been making in
 
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
relation to that is as evidenced by the
 
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
testimony submitted by Dr Baker in
 
00:11:05.329 --> 00:11:05.339 align:start position:0%
creating matrices we do have the Board
 
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
of Medicine does have a compact which
 
00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:09.899 align:start position:0%
does allow for the expeditious issuance
 
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
of licenses by the office currently the
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine is all also authorized
 
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:17.220 align:start position:0%
the office to
 
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:17.870 align:start position:0%
the office to
um

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
have a matrix if you will on what needs
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
to come before the board and what does
 
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
not to expediate the or to kind of make
 
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
the licensing process go faster is that
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
a fair and accurate assessment of the
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
and if you're make sure I've understand
 
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
your question right of whether or not we
 
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
feel that we're going to have be able to
 
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
work on this easily with the board I
 
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:47.220 align:start position:0%
mean we've had with the oplc we're
 
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
already working with them and feel
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable with their staff and our
 
00:11:56.769 --> 00:11:56.779 align:start position:0%
made changes and are adapting that
 
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
office well and I imagine
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
there may be issues and it's one of
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
those things where I don't know what I
 
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:07.740 align:start position:0%
don't know and if something comes up I
 
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
think the board has the ability to adapt
 
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
with the oplc what I can't say is what
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
license our licensees would experience
 
00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:21.899 align:start position:0%
our intent our job is to protect the
 
00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:22.850 align:start position:0%
our intent our job is to protect the
public

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
and whether or not the licensees find it
 
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
comfortable and about the role of the
 
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
oplc is of secondary importance
 
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:35.700 align:start position:0%
so that if we can get our job done well
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
with the current structure we will work
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
with it absolutely and I don't have any
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.230 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
I don't know how much time you want to
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
spend on any of this men I'm sure
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
another three minutes would be good okay
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
then I'm going to defer till later thank
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%

00:13:41.449 --> 00:13:41.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Elizabeth Eaton
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
I'm also an attorney with the office of
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm here representing three boards
 
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.530 align:start position:0%
and I'm here representing three boards
today

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
um I represent the Midwifery Council and
 
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
I have written testimony on their behalf
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
I'm here for the board of natural
 
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
scientists and I have written testimony
 
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
on their behalf as well as the Board of
 
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
Nursing with again written testimony on
 
00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:10.019 align:start position:0%
their behalf with the
 
00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:13.139 align:start position:0%
change here to the bill
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony may not apply
 
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
right now we'd have to kind of go back
 
00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
and reevaluate but I would love to give
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
these um this testimony to you on behalf
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
of these boards and
 
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that I need to explain
 
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
much more than that okay and this will
 
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
be discussed on Friday because this is
 
00:14:35.329 --> 00:14:35.339 align:start position:0%
to do with the repeal section of the
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
bill some of it does correct um I would
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
say that the board of natural scientists
 
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.470 align:start position:0%
say that the board of natural scientists
has

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
concerns about the application review
 
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:45.380 align:start position:0%
process similar to The Board of Medicine
 
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
and so that would apply even with the
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
without even when you're taking out the
 
00:14:52.079 --> 00:14:53.150 align:start position:0%
without even when you're taking out the
repeals

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
repeals
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
because licensing is Shifting in that
 
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
first section under oplc
 
00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.550 align:start position:0%
first section under oplc
[Music]

00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
um otherwise I'd have to take a look at
 
00:15:04.129 --> 00:15:04.139 align:start position:0%
what we've written here and really okay
 
00:15:07.129 --> 00:15:07.139 align:start position:0%
so anything that so I should say this is
 
00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
this is the process that representative
 
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
the house bills 465 Amendment will have
 
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
everything that's in House Bill 465 plus
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
some comments that were made at the last
 
00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
committee meeting up until the repeal
 
00:15:23.699 --> 00:15:25.069 align:start position:0%
committee meeting up until the repeal
section

00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
that part of the house bill 46 655 will
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
be taken out of house bill 2. and it
 
00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:33.959 align:start position:0%
will stand alone on its own
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
the repeal section we're going to take a
 
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
look at that and make comments on that
 
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
at any amendments that have to be made
 
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 2 will be made as a
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
non-germanic amendment to a bill that we
 
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
will have retained in this committee
 
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
right so that
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
if we don't get it all right the first
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
time around
 
00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
we can amend whatever amendments need to
 
00:15:59.329 --> 00:15:59.339 align:start position:0%
be done
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
we'll do over the summer for the next
 
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.930 align:start position:0%
we'll do over the summer for the next
year

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
says that does everybody understand that
 
00:16:10.329 --> 00:16:10.339 align:start position:0%
okay good thanks certainly I I guess
 
00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:12.779 align:start position:0%
coming here I didn't know that those
 
00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:14.339 align:start position:0%
parts were going to be correct you know
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm here on behalf of boards who
 
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
took votes to send testimony and so I'm
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%

I do especially since you're looking at
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
splitting it this way yeah
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
um if you were to look in my email there
 
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
is an attached document of suggested
 
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
edits for the um the bill and especially
 
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:26.339 align:start position:0%
they also I have seen the revision
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
suggested by actually you your name is
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
on it now
 
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.470 align:start position:0%
um and
um

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:36.169 --> 00:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
there are things that
 
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
the board of mental health practice and
 
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
the board of psychology I'm speaking I'm
 
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
Dr Deborah Warner I'm in Littleton I'm
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
speaking as an individual I'm very well
 
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
informed about these board things having
 
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
been involved in boards but I'm speaking
 
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
as an individual just want to make it
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
there are things that those two boys I
 
00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
did about 12 years ago about the same
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
time oplc was generated that were
 
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
Advanced and are especially good ways of
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
conducting board business and things
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
like protecting patient rights and
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
medical records privacy which did get
 
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
put into this revision as well as other
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
things like the
 
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.830 align:start position:0%
things like the
um

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:18.409 --> 00:18:18.419 align:start position:0%
the protection of the allegation status
 
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
and the disclosure about that and things
 
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
like that that are very important and I
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
believe should be promulgated across the
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
boards and I think it would be good to
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
include it in the first sections the 310
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
sections that are being separated out
 
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
from the other parts that are the
 
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
repeals because I think they're just
 
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
very good ways to do this across Sports
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
some things in the first portion the 310
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
section that particularly alarmed me are
 
00:18:51.409 --> 00:18:51.419 align:start position:0%
in the 310 colon 9 where the board the
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
oplc is allowed to initiate
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
investigations of its own
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
and not requiring a board order where
 
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
it's structured and has charges to be
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
investigated and inquired about and that
 
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
there'd be limitations to that process
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
the concern with that is that oplc or
 
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
any state agency that doesn't have guard
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
rails like that can do investigations on
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
whim they can do it on on their own
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
bias or whatever there could be I think
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
we have a good functioning oplc office
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not charging them with anything but
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
without it being in the law I think it
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
could get out of hand and I don't think
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
we want that to happen so various of my
 
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
my things if you were to look at my
 
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
attachment that has edits for the three
 
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
tens I believe that those are very
 
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
germane to the portion that you're
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
looking at keeping in this Bill thank
 
00:19:51.409 --> 00:19:51.419 align:start position:0%
you thank you does anyone have any
 
00:19:51.419 --> 00:19:53.390 align:start position:0%
you thank you does anyone have any
questions

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
no okay thank you all right thank you
 
00:19:59.890 --> 00:19:59.900 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak uh attorney
 
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:02.580 align:start position:0%

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:16.310 align:start position:0%
osterhound or executive director
Courtney

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.289 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:20:18.289 --> 00:20:18.299 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
you know what I don't need pink cards I
 
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the convenience but
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
this is not like a real this is a
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearing so we don't
 
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to really save them
 
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.010 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to really save them
perfect

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
um well then thank you madam chair for
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Lindsay Courtney
 
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of The Office
 
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
of professional lace Insurance
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
certification and with me at general
 
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
counsel Douglas osterhout
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
gotta correct this time
 
00:20:43.919 --> 00:20:44.630 align:start position:0%
gotta correct this time
um

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
so essentially the proposed amendment
 
00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.150 align:start position:0%
so essentially the proposed amendment
would

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:49.160 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
eliminate all of the proposed repeals
 
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
um that are presently in 655 and just
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
focus on the recodification of oplc and
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
310. practically I think as I've
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
expressed before it's quite difficult
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
for individuals to know where to look
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
when it comes to oplc's Authority
 
00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
because it's tucked up before all of the
 
00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
other technical statutes in 310a1 a
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
um and so I think recodification is just
 
00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:18.419 align:start position:0%
necessary in order to provide that
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
transparency as to what law actually
 
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.529 align:start position:0%
transparency as to what law actually
applies

00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:21.539 align:start position:0%
applies
 
00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:24.419 align:start position:0%
additionally one of the objectives that
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
I think oplc has and certainly I think
 
00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
has been expressed in legislation
 
00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539 align:start position:0%
throughout the last several years is
 
00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
that there's a need to streamline the
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
way we do business in the office and so
 
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
this proposed amendment really provides
 
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
a consistent regulatory framework for
 
00:21:42.409 --> 00:21:42.419 align:start position:0%
how the licensing boards are supposed to
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
operate both with respect to licensing
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
and with respect to discipline now
 
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
because the repeals are not proposed
 
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
here there would still be some conflicts
 
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
in the law and I think certainly the
 
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
boards that do have conflicting
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
Provisions there would be an opportunity
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
for them to rely on those statutes to
 
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
some extent we'd have to do that legal
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
analysis but I think it provides a
 
00:22:09.529 --> 00:22:09.539 align:start position:0%
pathway for us to start streamlining and
 
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
consolidating the way we do business and
 
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
I think frankly it's pretty necessary
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
um you know given our limited resources
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
regarding Dr Warner's specific concerns
 
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
I we the proposed statute does not
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
contain specifically the statutory
 
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:25.990 align:start position:0%
contain specifically the statutory
um

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
requirements that there be an allegation
 
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
and then that's elevated to a complaint
 
00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
practically that's the way our
 
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
investigations are already handled
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
essentially they are screened there's a
 
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
determination of whether or not they can
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
um once it's determined that the Acclaim
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
has been is potentially viable then it
 
00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:49.700 align:start position:0%
there's an order of formal investigation
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
in the psychology context that would be
 
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
when an order of formal investigation
 
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
would issue and be elevated to
 
00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:57.419 align:start position:0%
complaints so practically I don't see a
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
distinction in terms of the guardrails
 
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
for investigation I would say the
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
guardrails are what the guardrails are
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
for the board and that our investigative
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
Authority would be limited to to
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not there's been
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
a violation of something within the
 
00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:12.419 align:start position:0%
board's jurisdiction we don't have
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
plenary powers we're not a police we're
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
not a law enforcement agency so
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
certainly there are significant
 
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
limitations on what we would be able to
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
do I'll turn it over to Douglas to see
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
if if he has any other
 
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
um items I hate like to adjust
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
with that I'd be happy to answer any
 
00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that after Friday when we
 
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
review the rest of the house bill 2
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
those conflicts will go away
 
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
you know between the amendment so I hope
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
you'll be here on Friday I certainly
 
00:23:45.169 --> 00:23:45.179 align:start position:0%
plan on playing here okay great great
 
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
great great
 
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh representative Schmidt
 
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
again I I want to consult with the chair
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
with regard to how much we're going to
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
get into details here uh and how much is
 
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
going to be deferred until Friday uh but
 
00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:03.659 align:start position:0%
um for those of you who are relatively
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
recent to the whole process uh you may
 
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
not be aware that you know there there
 
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
is a history involved in some of this uh
 
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
that I'm concerned about and
 
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
specifically uh you know the the board
 
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
of mental health practice originally
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
grew out long before I came into the
 
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
legislature out of the board of
 
00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:25.400 align:start position:0%
psychologists okay
 
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
and gradually over the years uh in the
 
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
somewhat distant past the board of
 
00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:34.280 align:start position:0%
mental health practice grew up around
 
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
what had originally been the board of
 
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.230 align:start position:0%
what had originally been the board of
psychology

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
psychology
 
00:24:42.649 --> 00:24:42.659 align:start position:0%
and about roughly 10 years ago the
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
psychologist came in
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
to Edna and they said you know within uh
 
00:24:51.649 --> 00:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
the new bill saying this is not really
 
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
working we need to have our own board
 
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
and and the LED and this committee
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
looked at this very carefully and
 
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
ultimately determined that we were going
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
to give the psychologists their own
 
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
board again and keep the board of mental
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
health uh practice intact except for the
 
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:11.700 align:start position:0%
removal of the board of psychology now
 
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
we're talking about putting that back
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
together again and I have real concerns
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
as to whether this is uh you know a
 
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a problem because
 
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
to some degree to the to the ASP that to
 
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:28.740 align:start position:0%
the degree that we are trying to get
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
more efficient and and and smoother and
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
easier and more uniform that there's
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
some theoretical benefit to that but in
 
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
the Practical world the question I have
 
00:25:42.649 --> 00:25:42.659 align:start position:0%
is is it is the return on investment
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
really justified by the amount of
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
disruption that may be caused by this
 
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.750 align:start position:0%
disruption that may be caused by this
process

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919 align:start position:0%
and this is something that that I think
 
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
we have to give some consideration to to
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
see whether we're spending a dollar to
 
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
get you know uh 50 cents worth of
 
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
benefit and whether we're in enhancing
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
our procedures at the expense of the
 
00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:10.919 align:start position:0%
practitioners and the public so I want I
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
want everybody to be mindful of this
 
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
particular aspect is to see whether we
 
00:26:18.289 --> 00:26:18.299 align:start position:0%
are we are
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
getting bang for the buck and and if you
 
00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:23.940 align:start position:0%
can speak to any of those aspects at
 
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
this time I'm I would be happy to hear
 
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
that if Friday is better I'm willing to
 
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:31.559 align:start position:0%
wait until then as well thank you
 
00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:33.419 align:start position:0%
representative I I can speak to the fact
 
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
that the proposed changes that you speak
 
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
of are not in this bill and not in this
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment they're in hb2
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
certainly but not in this proposed
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
amendment this proposed amendment
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't impact the current structure of
 
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
any of those boards it would just
 
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.010 align:start position:0%
any of those boards it would just
provide

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
um a consistent way that we issue
 
00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
licenses but licenses in the agency as
 
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
well as manage investigations and
 
00:27:03.649 --> 00:27:03.659 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceedings
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
intent of the amendment was to do that
 
00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:12.299 align:start position:0%
so I think the the purpose of the
 
00:27:15.409 --> 00:27:15.419 align:start position:0%
amendment is to get house this part of
 
00:27:21.049 --> 00:27:21.059 align:start position:0%
the codification of oplc under 310 and
 
00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:24.860 align:start position:0%
to allow them to
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
go on with that and leave the rest of it
 
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2 so that and that gives
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
us more time really because we just got
 
00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:36.299 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 Thursday gives us more time
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
to look at those elements in it that are
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
more complicated and that overlap with
 
00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:45.059 align:start position:0%
existing statutes so that was the
 
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
purpose for the house bill 655 Amendment
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
Nikki if I may represent him just add
 
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
one more Point
 
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
um with respect to the licensing uh
 
00:27:57.289 --> 00:27:57.299 align:start position:0%
process that's proposed in this amended
 
00:27:59.330 --> 00:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
version of 655
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
it's consistent with what the large
 
00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
majority of our boards already do and
 
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
that the large majority of our boards
 
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
have already delegated the authority to
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
us to issue licenses unless there are
 
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
obviously questions regarding criminal
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
history checks which would still be
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
reviewed under this proposed structure
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
only a handful of boards still review
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
applications on a very regular basis
 
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
most boards have delegated that to us
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
because they recognize one that it
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
largely is just an administrative
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
function to make sure that all criteria
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
is satisfied because it's objective and
 
00:28:33.769 --> 00:28:33.779 align:start position:0%
then two there are serious Workforce
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
challenges with having to wait every 30
 
00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:39.299 align:start position:0%
60 90 days to review and possibly issue
 
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
licenses so it's consistent with what we
 
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.039 align:start position:0%
are doing but there have been concerns
 
00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:45.500 align:start position:0%
raised by
 
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
the LBA in audits performance audits as
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
to whether or not boards have the
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
authority to delegate that Authority so
 
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
this way this would essentially clear up
 
00:28:57.169 --> 00:28:57.179 align:start position:0%
that question
 
00:28:57.179 --> 00:28:59.350 align:start position:0%
that question
foreign

00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
I think that's very helpful to have this
 
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
dissociation as discussed early on that
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
you've already thought through this to a
 
00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:09.299 align:start position:0%
considerable degree I think that's very
 
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
helpful for us to have confidence that
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
we're not getting from here to
 
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
Manchester by way of Los Angeles okay
 
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
I'll be very brief uh shengue attorney
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
with the office of professional
 
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification I'm here on
 
00:29:39.889 --> 00:29:39.899 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Dental Board the board of
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
land surveyors the Board of Professional
 
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
Engineers and the board of accountancy
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
the board of accountancy has written
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
I believe the board of accountancies
 
00:30:09.169 --> 00:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
written testimony speaks for itself uh
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
to the best of my ability I'll answer
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
questions as it relates to that as far
 
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
as the land surveyors and the
 
00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
Professional Engineers uh they did meet
 
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
yesterday and wanted to put on the
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
record that they are in opposition to
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
655 full stop that was the vote that
 
00:30:27.529 --> 00:30:27.539 align:start position:0%
they gave me to represent to this
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
committee today as it relates to the
 
00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
Dental Board they had a few specific
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
concerns again this is notwithstanding
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment because they were not
 
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
aware of that that may or may not change
 
00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
their opinion as it relates to that I
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't make any representations as it
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
relates to that here today but
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
specifically as it regards the Dental
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
Board they did have concerns with the
 
00:30:51.409 --> 00:30:51.419 align:start position:0%
complaint process and procedure and the
 
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:54.059 align:start position:0%
vetting of the complaints having the
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
complaints come into oplc and having
 
00:30:59.690 --> 00:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
them conduct the investigation without
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
any input from the board was problematic
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
for them they view their own
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
professional expertise and ability to
 
00:31:09.529 --> 00:31:09.539 align:start position:0%
view those complaints of prime
 
00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:12.500 align:start position:0%
importance and utilizing those expertise
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
they are aware that oplc does have the
 
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
authority to contract with necessary
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
experts but that was their input as it
 
00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
related to that specific concern the
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
other concern when reviewing the 655
 
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
that was currently constructed prior to
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
the amendment was that there was no
 
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
consideration as to what constitute
 
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
professional misconduct as it related to
 
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
their specific profession so what if
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
anything they were to utilize so that
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
was a concern that they noted that also
 
00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:45.919 align:start position:0%
applies to their reciprocal discipline
 
00:31:48.529 --> 00:31:48.539 align:start position:0%
because that was within the same repeal
 
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
again that is not concerned given the
 
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
fact that there's an amendment here
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
today but they wanted to put that on the
